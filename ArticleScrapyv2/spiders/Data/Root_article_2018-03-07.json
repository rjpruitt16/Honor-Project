I stayed away because I simply couldn\u2019t get over the fact that my perfect Belle, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a woman so beautiful and charismatic that I imagine little woodland creatures do chores for her simply to be in her presence, was cast as a gotdamn feather duster, while Emma Watson landed the lead role. (Watson is a perfectly capable actress, just #NotMyBelle.)\n\n\n\nLuckily for all of us, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s star has only continued to rise, with British Vogue now hailing her as Britain\u2019s \u201cbreakout star\u201d on its April cover. The 34-year-old actress graces the top fashion magazine looking like a red-velvet dream.\n\nPhoto: Mikael Jansson (Vogue UK/Cond\u00e9 Nast)\n\nMbatha-Raw lands the cover amid a publicity blitz for A Wrinkle in Time, the Ava DuVernay-helmed adaptation of the children\u2019s literary classic of the same name. In the film, Mbatha-Raw plays Dr. Kate Murry, mother to tween Meg Murry (Storm Reid), who embarks on an epic journey to find her father, Alex, played by Chris Pine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a recent Vogue buzz notes, Mbatha-Raw has been \u201cescaping archetypes and quietly shaping a diverse CV for years.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s given riveting performances on both movie and TV screens, playing the title role in the period biopic Belle; showing off her singing skills as a troubled rock star in Beyond the Lights; and taking a time-traveling turn in the iconic, Emmy Award-winning \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode of Black Mirror (which seemed to serve as inspiration for Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s latest video, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d). Mbatha-Raw even manages to be captivating in Netflix\u2019s less-than-stellar recent release, The Cloverfield Paradox.\n\nAnd on the red carpet, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s sartorial growth has been equally impressive. This recent slideshow from Vogue UK tracks Mbatha-Raw\u2019s maturation as she settles into more streamlined, polished shapes with bold colors and textures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt certainly feels like Mbatha-Raw is coming into her moment, though she\u2019s been patiently building her career for decades, starting, as many Brits do, on the stage.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, you have power over your performance, but no power over the distribution or timetable,\u201d she recently told Refinery 29. \u201cSo it just so happens this is all coming out at the same time. But I guess I should embrace the ride!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbatha-Raw also talked about the power of seemingly innocuous beauty choices, like how to wear her hair on-screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to play a woman and not have race be the focus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will always bring who I am to the story and make sure my ethnicity is celebrated on-screen. I\u2019m not afraid to have those tough conversations with directors about how I represent myself. Hair, for instance, sounds like a superficial conversation. But images remain in our subconscious. So when it comes to representing on-screen, I can use my hair to send the important message to girls everywhere that they can be who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: British Vogue\u2019s April issue, featuring Mbatha-Raw\u2019s cover and interview, is available on newsstands Friday, March 9. Coincidentally, March 9 is the same date you can see the actress in the premiere of Ava DuVernay\u2019s A Wrinkle in Time!", "keywords": ["mbatharaws", "magnificence", "vogue", "wrinkle", "mbatharaw", "star", "cover", "recent", "glorious", "power", "actress", "need", "gracing", "redvelvet", "british", "hair", "gugu"], "polarity": 0.17958726025132277, "subjectivity": 0.5524222883597883},

The lovely thing that my father gave to me from the time I was a little girl was this kind of power. My father said to me, when I went to California to do Carmen Jones and Porgy and Bess, \u201cThis plane ticket and cash stays in your purse. If anything is making you uncomfortable, come home immediately.\u201d I said, \u201cDad, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, you most assuredly can\u2014just say \u2018Taxi!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Did you ever have to do that?\n\nDC: No, but I did tell them what I had in my purse. Women are coming forward and speaking up now. As a teen, I was even approached by my cousin at a family picnic. He asked me to go for a walk. When he got me alone, I knew it was trouble. When we returned to the area where our families were, the women that I thought would become very angry when they saw what he had tried to do\u2014I had almost taken his eye out so everyone would know\u2014when I saw their faces, they didn\u2019t want to say that they knew. Boy, did that bring me down. The women wouldn\u2019t stand up for me.\n\nTGU: What else do you see young women doing now that you fought for all of your life?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDC: I see women CEOs in every area. I watch them in the workplace today, and sometimes, way down inside of me, I feel this feeling that \u201cyou had something to do with that, Miss Carol Diahann Johnson.\u201d\n\nTGU: What women did you look up to in business?\n\nDC: Those who were kind enough to bring ballet to the ghetto. The performer Josephine Premice Fales. She was from a community that is all about being Haitian and black. That gives women such pride. Anything she felt I could benefit from, she would pull me out of school and make sure I got an appointment. I didn\u2019t really realize, until later, what she had done for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What is your greatest extravagance?\n\n\n\nDC: I feel just a little bit guilty ... trying to get my grandchildren and my daughter to live with me.

It\u2019s white men.\n\nAt first glance, especially if you\u2019re a woman or minority in the workplace, this seems like the kind of news you could file under \u201cWell, fucking duh.\u201d But what\u2019s notable here is the ways these white male leaders react.\n\nA recent study shared by MarketWatch and set to publish in the April issue of the Academy of Management Journal finds that when a woman or person of color assumes a top leadership role at a company, white males start to feel disaffected and take those feelings out on their colleagues, becoming less helpful to co-workers.\n\nFrom MarketWatch:\n\nTop white male leaders tended to become less helpful to other workers \u2014 particularly women and people of color \u2014 after the appointment of a minority-status CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf white men are scared they\u2019re being run out by female and/or POC talent, the numbers show that they have nothing to worry about. As MarketWatch notes, only 27 Fortune 500 CEOs are women (or 5.4 percent)\u2014none of whom are black. Only three Fortune 500 companies have a black man leading them.\n\nNonetheless, some people feel that white men are being discriminated against. One Ernst & Young national survey of 1,000 full-time employed Americans found that more than a third of all respondents think increased attention to diversity in the workplace has overlooked white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen white men react poorly to working for a nonwhite boss, their negative, unhelpful attitudes disproportionately affect their female and POC co-workers, MarketWatch noted. It\u2019s not as though being a woman or a person of color in the workplace is a cakewalk under ordinary circumstances\u2014these groups suffer disproportionately from wage gaps and lack of visibility in leadership roles. But a recent Catalyst survey found that both groups paid an \u201cemotional tax\u201d at work that impacted their broader health as well.\n\nThis phenomenon was most prominent, unsurprisingly, among women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reaction some white male leaders have to answering to a nonwhite-male executive can ultimately undermine the company and the leader they answer to.\n\nAs MarketWatch writes, women and people of color who ascend to top roles are not often set up for success. In 2014, one study confirmed the existence of the \u201cglass cliff\u201d: the elevation of people from minority groups to leadership roles to clean up the messes made by white men. The study confirmed that women and people of color are more likely to be promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis (hello, 2008 presidential elections). But if your subordinates are so resentful of your success that they start being less helpful and cooperative, this makes it harder for you as a leader to right the company\u2019s path and makes your upward climb even steeper.\n\nAnd what happens to these women and minority CEOs if they can\u2019t turn things around quickly enough?

The combination of sexism and racism we face as we move through our individual lives, including in the workplace, can also result in us being wary and on edge in a way that impacts our health and even our ability to succeed.\n\n\u201cEmotional tax\u201d is what a new study from researchers at Catalyst\u2014a nonprofit organization that seeks to accelerate progress for women through workplace inclusion\u2014calls this phenomenon, this psychological burden placed on women of color because of microaggressions and other exclusionary behavior.\n\n\u201cOf course .... we understand that individuals in their own right can experience stress, navigate work by challenges, have difficult relationships to navigate at work at times,\u201d Dnika Travis, vice president of research at Catalyst and one of the authors of the study, told The Root. \u201cThe emotional tax piece specifically ... is really that undue burden levied on many women and men of color as a result of unfair treatment.\u201d\n\nThe report, titled \u201cDay-to-Day Experiences of Emotional Tax Among Women and Men of Color in the Workplace,\u201d found that as a result of, or in anticipation of, this unfair treatment, professionals of color report high instances of being \u201con guard\u201d to protect themselves against racial and gender bias.\n\nOf the 1,569 professionals surveyed for the study, researchers found that across the board, more than half of all women of any given background reported being highly on guard. Black women led the group, with 58 percent saying that they felt on guard throughout their professional lives, followed by 56 percent of Latinas, 52 percent of multiracial women and 51 percent of Asian women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWomen of color continue to deal with some of the workplace\u2019s most entrenched hurdles, such as pay inequities and near invisibility in top leadership roles, as well as daunting roadblocks that stifle the meaningful dialogue that would help make real progress,\u201d Travis said in a press statement. \u201cOver time, these daily battles take a heavy toll on women of color, creating a damaging link between their health and the workplace. And because of consequences associated with emotional tax, companies must begin to take intentional action to avoid possible harm to their businesses and employees\u2019 health and well-being.\u201d\n\nBut women are not the only ones who pay this emotional tax. Men of color, especially blacks and Latinos (64 percent and 60 percent, respectively), most frequently report being on guard.\n\nIf you are a professional of color, or even if you just pay attention to the news cycle, this news or this feeling may not come as a surprise. A simple Google search will pull up countless stories of black employees being targeted, bullied or even penalized because of the way they choose to wear their hair in the workplace, for example, or the other snide comments, questions and even offensive \u201cgifts\u201d to which they have been made subject. The prominence of the #MeToo Movement gives insight into how women navigate the world and the workplace because of the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is little wonder, then, that women and men of color often have to prepare themselves\u2014put on a mask and perhaps even alter their appearance\u2014in order to navigate the workspace that is informed by our culture.\n\n\u201cI work from home, so none of my callers can see me. Based on the sound of my voice, they assume I am a young, Caucasian female, and so they are very comfortable making very racist comments against different nationalities. I have to pretend that I am not offended, and I am encouraged by my superiors to suppress my true identity,\u201d a contributor to the study, identified only as Tena, is quoted as saying. Tena is black and Latina.\n\nThis type of constant anxiety obviously has an impact on the well-being of the professionals involved and the way they view their work. Respondents who reported higher levels of being on guard were 38 percent more likely to consider leaving their jobs and 58 percent more likely to report sleep problems, which can, in turn, affect their ability to function efficiently and thrive at their job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat, in turn, impacts the business.\n\n\u201cStatistics show that people are going through experiences that are hard to grapple with and disheartening and difficult for people who are living that every day. And they bring that to the workplace,\u201d Travis told The Root. \u201cSo if we\u2019re not facing those difficult issues and allowing opportunities for employees to connect and support each other and really make change within the organization itself ... we\u2019re doing a disservice to companies and the potential for companies to live their mission and what their goals are for achieving results for the business.\u201d\n\nBut at the end of the day, men and women of color get shit done, despite it all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study shows that professionals of color who experience emotional tax are still reporting high aspirations to succeed and thrive, not only professionally but also personally and in their communities. Almost 90 percent of these professionals reported that realizing goals such as being influential leaders, obtaining financial stability and being altruistic were very or somewhat important to them. In the same vein, about 81 percent of respondents who reported higher levels of being on guard also reported more creativity at work.\n\n\u201cIt might be precisely because women and men of color are so driven to succeed and contribute that they experience emotional consequences when they are stymied. Any company that doesn\u2019t fully leverage this ambition is vulnerable to a talent drain,\u201d the study notes.\n\nIndeed if you have employees who are willing and determined to work and succeed, why wouldn\u2019t you want them to be at their best? Why wouldn\u2019t you want to give them all the tools they needed to succeed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut something that seems so common sense, especially in 2018, is often not that simple at all.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution?\n\nWhat it has always been: inclusion; actually listening to people of color when they speak about the issues they face\u2014no matter how seemingly subtle; actively involving people of color to show that their contributions are valued; taking measures to learn and fix the issues within a workplace; and making sure that everyone, from leadership to staff, is held accountable for inclusive leadership behaviors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo be able to really hold a spotlight on the value of inclusion is a huge takeaway, and that means that everyone has a responsibility in being leaders within their organization to ensure that an inclusive environment is what we\u2019re collectively trying to achieve,\u201d Travis said. \u201cThe findings around inclusion and the role of ensuring that people feel valued for their unique contribution, they\u2019re not having to hide or cover in the workplace and have that sense of belonging, and the importance that that plays in terms of mitigating emotional tax, is really critical.\u201d", "keywords": ["overall", "women", "work", "pay", "tax", "health", "thrive", "color", "workplace", "report", "reported", "thats", "professionals", "men", "study", "emotional"], "polarity": 0.08073539496806825, "subjectivity": 0.5511231123112309},

The greatest example of this is the fact that Donald Trump is the president of the United States. Having said that, I feel as if using him as the example is an insult to mediocre white men everywhere. Alas, it\u2019s a truth and a reality we have to face, right along with the reality of white privilege and white supremacy. Even with all of those things being real, however, there are white people who believe that they face discrimination and people who believe that the focus on diversity overlooks white men.\n\nNPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health released a poll Tuesday that showed a majority of white people believe that discrimination against them exists in America today.\n\nThe survey, which ran from Jan. 26 to April 9, sampled 3,453 adults in the United States\u2014902 of them white. Of those whites, 55 percent said that they believe there is discrimination against white people in America today, but a much smaller percentage said that they had actually experienced it. In addition, 84 percent of the whites also said that they believe there is discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities in America, too.\n\nAccording to NPR, the responses from white people could be broken down into three categories:\n\nthose who believe there is anti-white discrimination and say they have personally experienced it those who say there is anti-white discrimination but say they have not experienced it firsthand those who say there is no discrimination against whites in America\n\nThe survey found that income was a determining factor in how a person answered questions about discrimination. Whites in the low- to moderate-income range were more likely to say that whites were discriminated against and more likely to say that it had happened to them when applying for a job, a raise, a promotion or college admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of the survey mirror some of the responses in a new national survey conducted by Ernst & Young\u2014\u201cEY Studies Race, Gender and Exclusion at Work\u201d\u2014which found that of 1,000 full-time employed Americans surveyed between June and August 2017:\n\n32 percent of men overall have felt personally excluded in the workplace, and\n\n35 percent of all respondents think the increased focus on diversity in the workplace has overlooked white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of those who believe that diversity in the workplace has overlooked white men:\n\n43 percent are men, compared with 26 percent of women.\n\n62 percent think white men are overlooked for promotion and advancement opportunities.\n\n49 percent think white men are left out of diversity programs and initiatives.\n\n26 percent think white men are not included in mentorship or training programs.\n\n26 percent think white men don\u2019t feel comfortable using benefits such as paternity leave.\n\n20 percent think white men do not trust management.\n\nIt\u2019s odd that these views are so prevalent, because as the Washington Post pointed out, it is mostly white men who dominate the business world. A recent analysis by Fortune magazine shows that men hold 80 percent of the leadership roles at 16 Fortune 500 companies, and 72 percent of those men are white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Catalyst, which tracks gender data, 96 percent of the chief executives at S&P 500 companies and 89 percent of the directors are men, and the majority of them are white, too.\n\nThe Pew Research Center noted that men hold four-fifths of the seats in the House of Representatives and make up 80 percent of the U.S. Senate, and four in five voting members of Congress are white.\n\nEven with all these facts, there will be white people who say that the fears expressed in these surveys are true. Trump ran a campaign that played on fears such as these, and he doubles down on the idiocy every single day. Much like his relationship with the truth, these fears are founded in propaganda and lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while white people may be feeling extremely put upon, they need not worry; the deck is still stacked unevenly in their favor, and white men still run practically everything.\n\nExcept The Root.\n\nThank goodness for small miracles.\n\nRead more at NPR and the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["white", "believe", "overlooked", "think", "discrimination", "poll", "whites", "diversity", "survey", "say", "workplace", "men", "face"], "polarity": 0.029804380207606018, "subjectivity": 0.3096611274030629},

A Marine was relieved of duty and another disciplined for climbing a building to unfurl banners with racially charged slogans on them in September 2017.

Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, paid Stormy, n\u00e9e Stephanie Clifford, out of his own pocket, but he won\u2019t say why she was paid or what she was paid for. Cohen also claims that he was not reimbursed for his payment to Clifford; nor did he ask to be reimbursed.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Cohen told the New York Times in a statement. \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times also notes that Cohen would not answer any follow-up questions, including whether the president was aware of a $130,000 payment being made to Clifford.\n\n\n\nSo in case the first few paragraphs were too long to read, here is a recap of what Cohen wants people to believe: Trump didn\u2019t have an affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Trump didn\u2019t pay Daniels to be quiet about their affair. Cohen just randomly paid her $130,000 out of his own pocket and didn\u2019t ask the president for reimbursement. And Cohen won\u2019t answer whether the president knew that Clifford was being paid a lump sum by his personal lawyer.\n\n\n\nAt this point, we, the American people, should all be insulted. This lie registers right between second- and third-grade level. I feel like I need to channel a black mother who has just learned from her son that a large sum of money is missing:\n\n\n\nBlack mother: You expect me to believe that one of your little friends gave that hooker all the money and you didn\u2019t know nothing about it?! You better get upstairs and come up with a better story before your father gets home because even he ain\u2019t going to believe this shit!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeriously, this is embarrassing even for this administration. Here is what happened: In 2006, Trump bedded a porn star a month after his beloved captive Melania gave birth to their son, Baron. In January 2018, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Trump\u2019s lawyer paid said porn star\u2014who, over the years, hadn\u2019t kept her trap shut about said relationship\u2014$130,000 in 2016 to stop talking about said affair because Trump was running for president.\n\nCohen is giving the most insight into this exchange of funds, but he\u2019s playing the American public short. Cohen told the Times that it was a \u201cprivate transaction\u201d that was lawful. He added that he gave the Federal Election Commission the same statement \u201cin response to a complaint filed by the government watchdog group Common Cause, which filed a complaint saying that the payment, which was made through a limited liability company that Mr. Cohen established, was an in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign,\u201d the Times reports.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe complaint alleges that I somehow violated campaign finance laws by facilitating an excess, in-kind contribution,\u201d Cohen said in his statement. \u201cThe allegations in the complaint are factually unsupported and without legal merit, and my counsel has submitted a response to the F.E.C.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen refused to provide any more clarity into the situation, but that\u2019s cool because I think we all know what this money was for and why it was paid.", "keywords": ["130000", "didnt", "clifford", "payment", "paid", "star", "sex", "trumps", "lawyer", "cohen", "campaign", "times", "president", "mean", "doesnt", "trump", "porn"], "polarity": 0.058086519961519964, "subjectivity": 0.3639634439634439},

I wanted to believe the earlier reports she gave claiming that the president, who was not the president at the time of the alleged affair but was very married to Melania, liked to be spanked with a rolled-up Forbes magazine, because those are the kinds of juicy bits that make me laugh out loud as much as the imagery makes me want to vomit. I openly hate the president, and I don\u2019t hate much except avocados, most white policemen and Trump, so I wanted her stories of salacious cheating to be true.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now I\u2019m not so sure. Last night, after the president\u2019s inaugural State of the Union, Daniels, whose real name is who gives a shit, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and basically said a bunch of nothing.\n\nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Daniels had been paid $130,000 to keep the affair between the sheets. The reported payment was made by Trump\u2019s attorney. On Tuesday, just one day before Daniels was to appear on Kimmel, she released a letter denying all of the reported allegations. This, of course, is after Daniels had booked the appearance on the show, and it was too late for Kimmel to find someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this also comes after Daniels announced that she was going on a \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d strip-athon around roadside strip joints.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Kimmel from trying to hit Daniels with the hard questions. He asked her why the signatures on her denial letter didn\u2019t match up with the signature found on her autographs. Kimmel then asked if she signed the denial letter, to which Daniels evasively replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, did I? Doesn\u2019t look like my signature, does it?\u201d\n\nKimmel then asked if she knew where the letter came from and if she had authorized its release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt came from the internet.\u201d\n\nNice. Sounds like someone is trying to milk her 15 minutes of nasty fame by teasing the idea that she is actually having 15 minutes of reputable fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKimmel then told Daniels that if she didn\u2019t have a nondisclosure agreement with the president, she could flat out say that she didn\u2019t have one.\n\nTo which Daniels laughed and responded, \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, Jimmy.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeriously, at this point, I would\u2019ve been fine with Kimmel kicking her off his show. But he pressed on, trying to get Daniels to give him something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play \u2018Never have I ever,\u2019\u201d Kimmel told Daniels. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask a few questions about various things.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe quickly responded, \u201cThis feels like an \u2018SVU\u2019 episode [of Law & Order].\u201d\n\nDaniels kept playing dodgeball. She didn\u2019t answer anything; the whole episode was a wash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStormy, one last thing,\u201d Kimmel said, wrapping up the telecast. \u201cHave you ever made love to anyone whose name rhymes with \u2018Ronald Rump\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\nDaniels smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you whatever you want me to, baby.\u201d\n\nUggghhhh.

Cohen claims that at the time, he wasn\u2019t able to get ahold of the president, so he paid her out of his own funds, which his bank noted as suspicious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how the Wall Street Journal explains how it went down:\n\n[Cohen] wired the money to a lawyer for former actress Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, from an account at First Republic Bank.

It isn\u2019t clear when First Republic reported it to the government as suspicious. Mr. Cohen said he missed two deadlines earlier that month to make the $130,000 payment to Ms. Clifford because he couldn\u2019t reach Mr. Trump in the hectic final days of the presidential campaign, the person said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen admitted to paying off Daniels last month. He didn\u2019t say what the money was for, but he added that the payment didn\u2019t break campaign-finance laws.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Cohen began complaining shortly after Donald Trump won the election about how \u201che had yet to be reimbursed for the payment to Ms. Clifford.\u201d\n\nHere is what we know about this story: Trump absolutely, unequivocally had an affair with this woman, and his lawyer absolutely, unequivocally paid her off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen calls this story of him being upset about not being reimbursed \u201cfake news,\u201d but those of us who didn\u2019t vote for 45 know better.", "keywords": ["happy", "money", "wall", "payment", "trump", "star", "paid", "trumps", "lawyer", "cohen", "paying", "wasnt", "president", "reimbursed", "street", "report", "porn"], "polarity": 0.10497685185185186, "subjectivity": 0.45266203703703706},

It\u2019s not as though being a woman or a person of color in the workplace is a cakewalk under ordinary circumstances\u2014these groups suffer disproportionately from wage gaps and lack of visibility in leadership roles. But a recent Catalyst survey found that both groups paid an \u201cemotional tax\u201d at work that impacted their broader health as well.\n\nThis phenomenon was most prominent, unsurprisingly, among women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reaction some white male leaders have to answering to a nonwhite-male executive can ultimately undermine the company and the leader they answer to.\n\nAs MarketWatch writes, women and people of color who ascend to top roles are not often set up for success. In 2014, one study confirmed the existence of the \u201cglass cliff\u201d: the elevation of people from minority groups to leadership roles to clean up the messes made by white men. The study confirmed that women and people of color are more likely to be promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis (hello, 2008 presidential elections). But if your subordinates are so resentful of your success that they start being less helpful and cooperative, this makes it harder for you as a leader to right the company\u2019s path and makes your upward climb even steeper.\n\nAnd what happens to these women and minority CEOs if they can\u2019t turn things around quickly enough?

I wanted to believe the earlier reports she gave claiming that the president, who was not the president at the time of the alleged affair but was very married to Melania, liked to be spanked with a rolled-up Forbes magazine, because those are the kinds of juicy bits that make me laugh out loud as much as the imagery makes me want to vomit. I openly hate the president, and I don\u2019t hate much except avocados, most white policemen and Trump, so I wanted her stories of salacious cheating to be true.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now I\u2019m not so sure. Last night, after the president\u2019s inaugural State of the Union, Daniels, whose real name is who gives a shit, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and basically said a bunch of nothing.\n\nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Daniels had been paid $130,000 to keep the affair between the sheets. The reported payment was made by Trump\u2019s attorney. On Tuesday, just one day before Daniels was to appear on Kimmel, she released a letter denying all of the reported allegations. This, of course, is after Daniels had booked the appearance on the show, and it was too late for Kimmel to find someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this also comes after Daniels announced that she was going on a \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d strip-athon around roadside strip joints.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Kimmel from trying to hit Daniels with the hard questions. He asked her why the signatures on her denial letter didn\u2019t match up with the signature found on her autographs. Kimmel then asked if she signed the denial letter, to which Daniels evasively replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, did I? Doesn\u2019t look like my signature, does it?\u201d\n\nKimmel then asked if she knew where the letter came from and if she had authorized its release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt came from the internet.\u201d\n\nNice. Sounds like someone is trying to milk her 15 minutes of nasty fame by teasing the idea that she is actually having 15 minutes of reputable fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKimmel then told Daniels that if she didn\u2019t have a nondisclosure agreement with the president, she could flat out say that she didn\u2019t have one.\n\nTo which Daniels laughed and responded, \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, Jimmy.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeriously, at this point, I would\u2019ve been fine with Kimmel kicking her off his show. But he pressed on, trying to get Daniels to give him something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play \u2018Never have I ever,\u2019\u201d Kimmel told Daniels. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask a few questions about various things.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe quickly responded, \u201cThis feels like an \u2018SVU\u2019 episode [of Law & Order].\u201d\n\nDaniels kept playing dodgeball. She didn\u2019t answer anything; the whole episode was a wash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStormy, one last thing,\u201d Kimmel said, wrapping up the telecast. \u201cHave you ever made love to anyone whose name rhymes with \u2018Ronald Rump\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\nDaniels smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you whatever you want me to, baby.\u201d\n\nUggghhhh.

Now a new report raises questions as to whether there is more to Trump\u2019s history with Daniels than just a one-time encounter.\n\nJacob Weisberg reports on Slate that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told him that she\u2019d had an affair with Trump that began after she met him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada in 2006. The sexual relationship continued for nearly a year, according to her account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring her conversations with Weisberg\u2014which took place between August and October 2016\u2014Daniels said that she could describe things about Trump that only someone who had seen him naked would know, and contrary to what Marla Maples is supposed to have said, Trump was not that great in bed.\n\nTrump allegedly made several unkept promises to Daniels, telling her that he would buy her a condo in Tampa, Fla., and that he would feature her in a season of Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels told Weisberg that she had proof of the affair. She had the phone numbers of Trump\u2019s longtime personal assistant Rhonda Graff and his bodyguard Keith Schiller, who helped her arrange rendezvous with Trump.\n\nFrom Slate:\n\nGiven what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didn\u2019t think an extramarital affair would be a highly significant story. What interested me more was Daniels\u2019 allegation that Trump had negotiated to buy her silence. Daniels said that, through intermediaries, she and Trump had worked out an agreement for the presidential candidate to pay her a six-figure sum to keep quiet. More specifically, she said her lawyer Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hills\u2013based attorney who specializes in claims against celebrities, had worked out the terms with Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time Daniels spoke with Weisberg, she indicated that she believed Trump was stalling on the agreement to pay her the $130,000.\n\nA week after the 2016 election, she stopped returning calls, and a friend of hers told Weisberg that she had, in fact, taken the money from Trump.\n\nSounds messy, but it also sounds just like Trump. He\u2019s just sloppy all around.\n\nAnd, apparently, bad in bed.

Not only did age play a factor, but being a black woman in the cosmetic industry was something that was very new at that time.\n\nWhen I launched my online store at SuperstarNailLacquer.com, I did not post photos of me on my site so that people would not judge my product by a skin color, but by quality. I would get major calls from other brands wanting to collaborate with Superstar on some pretty amazing projects. It was disappointing to find that once these brands met with me in person, the deal went south for what they called \u201ccreative differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter so many times of experiencing disappointing outcomes, I decided that I would not let this stop me, so I began to study my industry, educating myself so I would know more than many of those I was meeting with. Over time, my business gained such success online; big brands couldn\u2019t ignore me any longer. One thing I learned from this is that no matter how others treat you, there is no room for excuses. If you put your mind, will and heart into your business, you can be successful.\n\n[My] career high was being featured on Forbes\u2019 Business of Influence series.

It\u2019s white men.\n\nAt first glance, especially if you\u2019re a woman or minority in the workplace, this seems like the kind of news you could file under \u201cWell, fucking duh.\u201d But what\u2019s notable here is the ways these white male leaders react.\n\nA recent study shared by MarketWatch and set to publish in the April issue of the Academy of Management Journal finds that when a woman or person of color assumes a top leadership role at a company, white males start to feel disaffected and take those feelings out on their colleagues, becoming less helpful to co-workers.\n\nFrom MarketWatch:\n\nTop white male leaders tended to become less helpful to other workers \u2014 particularly women and people of color \u2014 after the appointment of a minority-status CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf white men are scared they\u2019re being run out by female and/or POC talent, the numbers show that they have nothing to worry about. As MarketWatch notes, only 27 Fortune 500 CEOs are women (or 5.4 percent)\u2014none of whom are black. Only three Fortune 500 companies have a black man leading them.\n\nNonetheless, some people feel that white men are being discriminated against. One Ernst & Young national survey of 1,000 full-time employed Americans found that more than a third of all respondents think increased attention to diversity in the workplace has overlooked white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen white men react poorly to working for a nonwhite boss, their negative, unhelpful attitudes disproportionately affect their female and POC co-workers, MarketWatch noted. It\u2019s not as though being a woman or a person of color in the workplace is a cakewalk under ordinary circumstances\u2014these groups suffer disproportionately from wage gaps and lack of visibility in leadership roles. But a recent Catalyst survey found that both groups paid an \u201cemotional tax\u201d at work that impacted their broader health as well.\n\nThis phenomenon was most prominent, unsurprisingly, among women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reaction some white male leaders have to answering to a nonwhite-male executive can ultimately undermine the company and the leader they answer to.\n\nAs MarketWatch writes, women and people of color who ascend to top roles are not often set up for success. In 2014, one study confirmed the existence of the \u201cglass cliff\u201d: the elevation of people from minority groups to leadership roles to clean up the messes made by white men. The study confirmed that women and people of color are more likely to be promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis (hello, 2008 presidential elections). But if your subordinates are so resentful of your success that they start being less helpful and cooperative, this makes it harder for you as a leader to right the company\u2019s path and makes your upward climb even steeper.\n\nAnd what happens to these women and minority CEOs if they can\u2019t turn things around quickly enough?

Excellence.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a concept that has literally taken flight\u2014courtesy of skyrocketing black-owned and operated tour company Up in the Air Life.\n\nA glittery diamond on an increasingly dark travel-movement landscape, UITAL\u2019s rep for serving up consistent black excellence from Cuba to Croatia is so strong, it\u2019s caught the attention of corporate giants like Walmart and has caused the growing Washington, D.C.-based company to triple its revenue since its first trip in 2014. This year UITAL is projected to pull in $1 million.\n\nThe reason?\n\nUITAL clients don\u2019t take trips\u2014they partake in epic, culturally curated adventures, whether that\u2019s puffing poolside cigars with the boys in Cartagena, Colombia, or bouncing to Paris for the kickoff of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s world tour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor passport-sporting millennials and Gen Xers, the opportunity to view the world through a prism of opulence and peak blackness is an opportunity too delicious to pass up.\n\n\u201cPut a group of fly, young, upwardly mobile black folk on a yacht or a plane together and magic happens,\u201d says founder Claire Soares, who has built her empire part time working as a software sales rep.\n\n\u201cUITAL tends to attract like-minded groups of people\u2014execs for companies like Microsoft and Google along with doctors, consultants and entrepreneurs\u2014folks who are well-traveled with high expectations,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe networking is often just as attractive as the experiences are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what \u201cexperiences\u201d they are: Soares and her staff of 25, located from Mexico to New York (she plans to triple her part-time fun consultant crew by summer), literally scour the earth to create the most memorable adventures for their clientele.\n\n\u201cWe have an on-staff sommelier who takes clients on food and drink jaunts through Champagne, France, and Bologna, Italy, pairing five-course meals with some of the world\u2019s best wines and champagnes,\u201d says Soares, the self-proclaimed \u201cChief Memory Maker.\u201d \u201cIn France, we\u2019ve rented out one of the acclaimed Moet caves and thrown black-tie dinners. In Bologna, our clients have been able to toast to the patriarch of one of the oldest vineyards in Italy, and rub elbows with the Italian wine ambassador. They also get to learn how to make pasta and sauces from scratch.\u201d\n\nUITAL \u201coffers only the best,\u201d says Soares, because often black travelers are not made to feel welcome or appreciated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think in life [our] people aren\u2019t made to feel appreciated, so we go above and beyond to make our guests\u2019 experiences special and unique,\u201d Soares says. \u201cSeeing them cry at some of the surprise gifts we\u2019ve given them, or to see us chilling out at literally some of the most luxurious places on earth\u2014like the Copacabana Palace in Rio\u2014brings a smile to my face.\u201d\n\nThe travel-related glee is both shared and apparent, as evidenced by the rise of such groups as Nomadness Travel Tribe, Travel Noire and the Black Travel Movement, which have hundreds of thousands of black social media followers among them. Then there are those who regularly hop off Facebook and onto a plane, or intend to: CNN reports that intent among black travelers went from 3 percentage points in 2013 to 6 in 2014, then climbed to 19 points in 2015 and went up another 18 points in 2016, per the travel and hospitality marketing firm MMGY Global. With many professional blacks following a nationwide trend that sees 20-, 30- and even 40-somethings getting married and having children later in life, they\u2019ve got both the time and money to spend on travel.\n\nBut UITAL\u2019s climbing sales among this prime audience speak for themselves: Last month, the company sold out three mega yachts for Croatia in August in just a few hours\u2014when Soares had only planned on selling one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cClose to 100 people jumped on this opportunity from all around the world,\u201d says the Virginia native, referencing the pricey trip but also UITAL\u2019s convenient \u201cpay to play\u201d layaway plan. \u201cIt\u2019s been our fastest-selling yachting trip to date,\u201d she says about UITAL\u2019s continued presence as one of the few black groups at world Yacht Week. \u201cWord has gotten out about our high level of service. We cater to Black clientele in a way no other company is doing.\u201d\n\nThirty-four-year-old D.C.-based data engineer Dartanion Williams can attest to this.\n\nHaving been on six tours hosted by UITAL or Urban Yacht Life (Soares\u2019 spinoff company) and counting since 2014, Williams says that being down with the UITAL crew has been a life-changing experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI linked up with Claire and UITAL at a time I was ready to travel but a lot of my friends were not,\u201d he says. \u201cThat meant I walked away with a whole new group of friends!

Now a new report raises questions as to whether there is more to Trump\u2019s history with Daniels than just a one-time encounter.\n\nJacob Weisberg reports on Slate that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told him that she\u2019d had an affair with Trump that began after she met him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada in 2006. The sexual relationship continued for nearly a year, according to her account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring her conversations with Weisberg\u2014which took place between August and October 2016\u2014Daniels said that she could describe things about Trump that only someone who had seen him naked would know, and contrary to what Marla Maples is supposed to have said, Trump was not that great in bed.\n\nTrump allegedly made several unkept promises to Daniels, telling her that he would buy her a condo in Tampa, Fla., and that he would feature her in a season of Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels told Weisberg that she had proof of the affair. She had the phone numbers of Trump\u2019s longtime personal assistant Rhonda Graff and his bodyguard Keith Schiller, who helped her arrange rendezvous with Trump.\n\nFrom Slate:\n\nGiven what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didn\u2019t think an extramarital affair would be a highly significant story. What interested me more was Daniels\u2019 allegation that Trump had negotiated to buy her silence. Daniels said that, through intermediaries, she and Trump had worked out an agreement for the presidential candidate to pay her a six-figure sum to keep quiet. More specifically, she said her lawyer Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hills\u2013based attorney who specializes in claims against celebrities, had worked out the terms with Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time Daniels spoke with Weisberg, she indicated that she believed Trump was stalling on the agreement to pay her the $130,000.\n\nA week after the 2016 election, she stopped returning calls, and a friend of hers told Weisberg that she had, in fact, taken the money from Trump.\n\nSounds messy, but it also sounds just like Trump.

Although Brewer said she is leaving the $57 billion-a-year company because \u201cshe wants a new challenge,\u201d the word is that she is leaving because Sam\u2019s is lagging behind its main competitor, Costco. Her last day on the job will be Feb. 1.\n\nUnder Brewer, Sam's Club has made large strides in e-commerce, says Fortune, but the 650-store chain has struggled to narrow the sales-growth gap with Costco, whose growth rates have been several percentage points higher than Sam's in recent years. Fortune also reports that the average household income of a Costco member is about $120,000, making it much less vulnerable to downturns in consumer spending.\n\nBrewer joined Wal-Mart in 2006 as regional vice president, overseeing operations in Georgia. She climbed the ranks to become division president of the Southeast, and later Wal-Mart East.

It doesn\u2019t have a name, though it probably should, since we\u2019ve traveled the world together for years. For now, let\u2019s call her Clare\u2014probably Clare the Eighth, at this point. But she\u2019s always a simple, clear bucket case measuring approximately 4 by 5 by 8 inches, with a double-zip top, maximizing both Transportation Security Administration-required transparency and capacity, and allowing my liquids to stand when necessary.\n\nClare and I just returned from a nearly weeklong holiday trip to Minneapolis, which I easily managed with a carry-on (even with a few last-minute presents packed). Prior to takeoff, I documented the contents and gave tips on my packing process, and a few colleagues were impressed by how much I fit into such a small bag\u2014especially with room to spare for Clare. And since advice often inspires more questions, I was asked to write a more detailed follow-up: Specifically, how do I pack my beauty bag?\n\nAs previously noted, my role at The Glow Up requires splitting my time between my current home in Chicago and my work home in New York. In fact, I just wrapped a seven-week stay, which included being in the office almost daily; attending The Root 100 gala, numerous business lunches, dinners and gatherings; as well as Thanksgiving, my godson\u2019s birthday and a series of holiday parties. In short, it was a lot of look\u2014I am a beauty and fashion editor, after all\u2014but I navigated the bulk of it with two average-sized cases and a very well-curated Clare onboard. How do I do it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlay It Safe\n\nI\u2019m no minimalist. I\u2019m a collector\u2014of things, people, experiences and definitely makeup. Tidying guru Marie Kondo would likely be paralyzed by the sheer volume of product I possess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, as much as I love to play with makeup, I\u2019m clear on the fact that traveling is not the time. Instead, I focus on my fail-safes\u2014products I know will keep me looking polished throughout my stay. When packing, space is a splurge, so it\u2019s important to fill it wisely.\n\nPrioritize Moisturizing\n\nBetween air travel, forced heat and the season, lotion is a nonnegotiable for me, which is why I\u2019m willing to concede precious space to a full 3-ounce tube\u2014this is a head-to-toe affair! My current fave is Vaseline Intensive Care\u2019s Cocoa Radiant lotion, which is rich enough to feel luxurious but is a pennies-on-the-dollar amount of a luxury product. Since I love to slather it on, cost per wear is important. Similarly, I strictly cleanse with oil on the road and make space for balms, serums and creams, because all makeup looks better on well-hydrated skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink Small\n\nA glance at Sephora\u2019s \u201cMini Size\u201d section is all you need to confirm that on-the-go beauty has advanced far beyond \u201ctrial-sized.\u201d There are scaled-down versions of almost everything\u2014from Nars\u2019 cult-favorite concealer to Cr\u00e8me de la Mer (at $85 per half-ounce). I especially find mini mascaras handy, since aside from taking up less space, you avoid the inevitable dry-out that happens with full-sized options, allowing you to use all of your product.\n\nOn that note, traveling is an ideal time to use your samples. For instance, I\u2019m never without a packet or two of Kiehl\u2019s Epidermal Re-Texturing Micro-Dermabrasion\u2014I ask for them when I buy full-sized versions. (Pro-tip: Instead of ripping them open, prick sample packets with a safety pin to keep product fresh for multiple uses.) Similarly, why bring bottles of shampoo and conditioner when a few conditioner or protein packs easily slide into the side of your kit, and are perfect for a quick co-wash or two?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAct Like an Artist\n\nIf you absolutely must bring an array of shadows, make sure they\u2019re in palette form. Palettes not only provide maximum variety in minimum space, but the packaging often provides an instant buffer\u2014and mirror\u2014while packing as flat as a checkbook (remember those?). My current favorites? The Prism holiday eye shadow palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills features 14 shades of classic mattes, shimmery metallics and jewel tones\u2014with a dual-ended, high-quality brush\u2014while the Balm\u2019s How \u2019Bout Them Apples? palette has a half-dozen cream blushes that easily layer for a freshly flushed look (Bobbi Brown also makes a great multipurpose Pot Rouge in Chocolate Cherry.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for brushes? I have a few tricks up my sleeve that eradicate the need for them altogether (face painting, anyone?). But when I decide to bring my tools, a brush roll is my go-to for both protection and organization.\n\n\n\nTry New Textures\n\nI love playing with powders but keep them to a minimum when packing my kit\u2014one broken eye shadow can mean hours of cleanup. Instead I rely on creams, pencils and pens to create my signature day-to-night look: a subtly bronzed smoky eye with a little highlight, blush, and nude or red lip. Just a few swipes of an eye shadow stick or Fenty Match Stix and a smudge from my (clean) finger, and I\u2019m good to go (I actually use this technique at home, too).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m partial to the creamy textures and variety of colors available from Maybelline Eyestudio Color Tattoo Concentrated Crayons and NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils, but my absolute faves? Beauty-supply staple Nicka K New York Eye Light Crayon in Brown and Liquid Eyeliner Brush Pen; I buy them by the handful!\n\nTake the Tube\n\nMy daily foundations come in glass bottles, which aren\u2019t practical for travel\u2014especially because I\u2019m a klutz. To keep both my foundations and skin intact on the road, I use BB and CC creams for daily wear, with a little concealer for extra coverage. Right now I\u2019m doing a trial run with Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream, but there are better color ranges available from SheaMoisture, Iman Cosmetics and Black Up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor concealer, perhaps the best product I\u2019ve found in the past year is Onomie Bright Concealing Elixir. Don\u2019t let the tiny tube fool you; this emollient, super-concentrated formula means just a dab\u2019ll do you for months of all-day coverage that also works to brighten the dark circles it conceals. And this newer brand truly caters to all, in shades named after notable women.\n\nSo, with all of that covered, what\u2019s in my beauty bag?\n\n\n\nhand and body lotion\n\nhyaluronic acid serum (trust me on this)\n\nday and night moisturizers\n\nsample-sized mask and exfoliator\n\nacne spot treatment (with salicylic acid)\n\ndeep-cleansing oil\n\nBB cream (for extra coverage: Dermablend Flawless Creator Foundation Drops)\n\n\n\ncream concealer\n\ncream blush\n\nhighlighter sticks (3)\n\neye shadow pencils (4), eyeliner pen and eyebrow pencil (with brush tip)\n\nmini mascara and clear mascara for brows\n\nnude lipstick (1), nude gloss (1), long-wearing red and violet lip paints (2) (Fun fact: A colleague confessed that she\u2019s brought as many as 27 lipsticks on a trip.

Of course I am\u2014though, to be fair, my accommodations generally include soap or body wash. But I\u2019m picky, and admit I did make the last-minute addition of a trial-sized moisturizing body wash\u2014which Clare fit without incident.\n\nOn that note, I also always carry a full-sized deodorant in my purse, right next to my umbrella, because a) I inevitably forget to apply it some mornings, and b) travel-sized deodorants usually end with product flying across the room.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd ain\u2019t nobody got time for that.

He had already been accused of sexually assaulting several women, was caught on audio talking about how his wealth allows him to violate women, and constantly belittled Hillary Clinton and other women along his campaign tour. Learning now that he apparently paid a woman to keep quiet about a sexual encounter he had when he was very married (Trump married Melania in 2005) doesn\u2019t change a damn thing. In fact, stop reading this now and go back to wearing that weird hat thing of Donald\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m back.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal report, Clifford and Trump met in July of 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. The sexual encounter happened sometime after this initial meeting. In 2016, Clifford\u2019s lawyer negotiated a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for the one-time payout, the Journal reports.\n\nA White House official said that this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has faced allegations of inappropriate behavior with women, and adamantly denied that the encounter took place.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,\u201d the White House official told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\nIn a statement sent to the Journal, Trump lawyer \u201cCohen didn\u2019t address the $130,000 payment but said of the alleged sexual encounter that \u2018President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen added in the statement: \u201cThis is now the second time that you are raising outlandish allegations against my client. You have attempted to perpetuate this false narrative for over a year; a narrative that has been consistently denied by all parties since at least 2011.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Journal has set out to prove that Clifford, 38, had in intimate relationship with the now president. The newspaper also noted that the adult-film star had been in talks with Good Morning America and that the National Enquirer had agreed to pay Clifford for a story about her relationship with Trump. However, the tabloid newspaper didn\u2019t publish the story and says that the company paid Clifford to write fitness columns and appear on magazine covers, the Journal reports.\n\nClifford didn\u2019t respond to multiple emails from the Journal seeking comment, but Cohen emailed the Journal back a response using an all-caps subject line\u2014TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN\u2014and signed by \u201cStormy Daniels,\u201d denying that she had a \u201csexual and/or romantic affair\u201d with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople with knowledge of the agreement told the Journal that Clifford actually considered ending the deal because her payment was taking too long.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Journal describes the transaction:\n\nThe payment was made to Ms. Clifford through her lawyer in the matter, Keith Davidson, with funds sent to Mr. Davidson\u2019s client-trust account at City National Bank in Los Angeles, according to the people. \u201cI previously represented Ms. Daniels,\u201d Mr. Davidson said, referring to Ms. Clifford\u2019s stage name. \u201cAttorney-client privilege prohibits me from commenting on my clients\u2019 legal matters.\u201d A spokeswoman for City National Bank declined to comment. The agreement with Ms. Clifford came as the Trump campaign confronted allegations from numerous women who described unwanted sexual advances and alleged assaults by Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, 50 Cent wants to say something about all of this:\n\nGIF\n\nRead more at the Wall Street Journal.", "keywords": ["stormy", "women", "clifford", "wall", "sexual", "paid", "star", "journal", "trumps", "lawyer", "ms", "street", "report", "quiet", "trump", "porn", "encounter"], "polarity": 0.0961309523809524, "subjectivity": 0.36339285714285713},

It\u2019s white men.\n\nAt first glance, especially if you\u2019re a woman or minority in the workplace, this seems like the kind of news you could file under \u201cWell, fucking duh.\u201d But what\u2019s notable here is the ways these white male leaders react.\n\nA recent study shared by MarketWatch and set to publish in the April issue of the Academy of Management Journal finds that when a woman or person of color assumes a top leadership role at a company, white males start to feel disaffected and take those feelings out on their colleagues, becoming less helpful to co-workers.\n\nFrom MarketWatch:\n\nTop white male leaders tended to become less helpful to other workers \u2014 particularly women and people of color \u2014 after the appointment of a minority-status CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf white men are scared they\u2019re being run out by female and/or POC talent, the numbers show that they have nothing to worry about. As MarketWatch notes, only 27 Fortune 500 CEOs are women (or 5.4 percent)\u2014none of whom are black. Only three Fortune 500 companies have a black man leading them.\n\nNonetheless, some people feel that white men are being discriminated against. One Ernst & Young national survey of 1,000 full-time employed Americans found that more than a third of all respondents think increased attention to diversity in the workplace has overlooked white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen white men react poorly to working for a nonwhite boss, their negative, unhelpful attitudes disproportionately affect their female and POC co-workers, MarketWatch noted. It\u2019s not as though being a woman or a person of color in the workplace is a cakewalk under ordinary circumstances\u2014these groups suffer disproportionately from wage gaps and lack of visibility in leadership roles. But a recent Catalyst survey found that both groups paid an \u201cemotional tax\u201d at work that impacted their broader health as well.\n\nThis phenomenon was most prominent, unsurprisingly, among women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reaction some white male leaders have to answering to a nonwhite-male executive can ultimately undermine the company and the leader they answer to.\n\nAs MarketWatch writes, women and people of color who ascend to top roles are not often set up for success. In 2014, one study confirmed the existence of the \u201cglass cliff\u201d: the elevation of people from minority groups to leadership roles to clean up the messes made by white men. The study confirmed that women and people of color are more likely to be promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis (hello, 2008 presidential elections). But if your subordinates are so resentful of your success that they start being less helpful and cooperative, this makes it harder for you as a leader to right the company\u2019s path and makes your upward climb even steeper.\n\nAnd what happens to these women and minority CEOs if they can\u2019t turn things around quickly enough?

So it\u2019s safe to say I know a thing or two about packing a suitcase. By the time I was due to depart for college, I was already a pro.\n\nBut it was becoming a model that really polished those skills. Bouncing from location to location\u2014and, often, climate to climate\u2014while living out of an increasingly shrinking carry-on (thanks, TSA) is not for the faint of heart. But if you know how to do it, it can be a lot of fun (or, at least, a cool party trick).\n\nI wish I could say that things have mellowed over the years, but as a Chicago-based editor at a New York City-based publication, mine is now a life lived ... midcoastally (Chicago being the \u201cthird coast\u201d). In fact, I just spent the last two months living out of two small suitcases in a guest bedroom\u2014and boy, is my wardrobe tired.\n\nSo when I caught Oneika the Traveller\u2019s new Facebook series \u201cOne Bag and You\u2019re Out\u201d by the Travel Channel, I knew I\u2019d found my ministry. And as many of us are packing today to take off for the holidays, I thought it was worth the friendly reminder: YOU DON\u2019T NEED ALL THAT STUFF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor serious: Whether you\u2019re packing for the next week or the next two months, as long as you have access to laundry facilities, you can easily create a capsule wardrobe that\u2019ll keep you looking fly on the fly.\n\nNow, Oneika\u2019s tips are clearly more directed at international travelers like herself headed to warm-weather destinations. This evening, I\u2019m headed from Chicago to Minneapolis. Needless to say, the lightweight jackets she\u2019s recommending ain\u2019t gon\u2019 cut it.\n\nSo how do I go from brick city to arctic tundra in one carry-on? Check it:\n\nPack in neutrals and layers: Oneika got this right for sure. And I know\u2014it sounds more basic than festive. But if you get your shapes and accessories right, it\u2019s anything but. For this weeklong trip, I\u2019ve got:\n\nAdvertisement\n\none black tank\n\none black lightweight thermal turtleneck\n\none black-and-white-striped long-sleeved crew\n\none charcoal lightweight sheer wool tunic\n\none charcoal lightweight sweaterdress\n\none heather logo sweatshirt\n\none pair of sweatpants (for lounging with the fam)\n\none pair of jeans (with a velvet tuxedo stripe because holidays)\n\none pair of black crepe pants\n\none pair of black overalls (for playing with the kiddos)\n\none set of workout leggings and top\n\none lightweight linen robe\n\none nightgown\n\nsix sets of underwear\n\nthree bras (including a sports bra)\n\nfour sets of socks (including sports socks)\n\none pair of black control-top opaque tights (Spanx to the rescue!)\n\nmy toiletry kit\n\n\n\nmy flat iron\n\na brush\n\none pair of sneakers\n\none pair of velvet loafers\n\none pair of slippers\n\nmy favorite motorcycle boots, which I\u2019ll wear on the plane (they slide off and on easily in security)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I\u2019m taking a black beret, a pair of gloves, three sets of earrings and a bracelet, an eternity scarf and a scarf/head wrap.

Again, check it:\n\nWith today expected to be one of the busiest travel days of the holiday season, I want to take up as little space as possible (save for my down coat, which is nonnegotiable in these temps).

Everyone is asking me what I want, and I keep drawing a blank. The thrill of materialism just ain\u2019t what it used to be. Somehow it\u2019s all Gucci for me this year\u2014without the Gucci.\n\nWhat I want lies more in my heart than in my wallet. I must be maturing, because I feel this way even before I\u2019ve gorged myself at a single office party or lost myself in the sound of wrapping paper flying around the room like shrapnel on Christmas morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy real desire is not minimalism; I definitely want more. But not more stuff. I want to be more connected, more judicious and stronger in every area of my life.\n\nHow do I get what I want this Christmas? I give it to myself, that\u2019s how. It starts with the thoughts I think every day, and getting real with myself about what I\u2019m wasting my time\u2014and, by extension, my life\u2014thinking about.\n\nHow do I do that? The best way to measure is to look at what\u2019s going through my head, and the effect it has on the people I love, care about and work with when I speak and act on it. Not wasting my time and energy\u2014or anybody else\u2019s, for that matter\u2014is a priceless gift.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToo much stuff weighs us down. A very smart friend of mine once told me a quote she\u2019d heard somewhere: \u201cWhat you own owns you.\u201d It\u2019s stayed with me since she said it, and comes back to haunt me when I\u2019m frantically rifling through my closet, looking for that one black sweater that\u2019s impossible to find because I have more clothes than I can find space to put away.\n\n\u201cWhat you own owns you\u201d haunts me in the form of a monthly credit card bill that stings with the shock of \u201cWhat the hell did I buy?\u201d when I open it. Time is money. Time is also all we have, so I want to remind myself not to give it away carelessly. And in the interest of not giving anything away carelessly, I\u2019m thinking\u2014how can I give generously?\n\nWhat\u2019s the sexiest, most lavish gift I could give myself? To free myself of all the clutter I\u2019ve collected, due to boredom or impulse. Gluttony and vanity are the two evil elves I don\u2019t want on my shelf this year. What\u2019s on my Christmas list this year are the kinds of gifts that will keep on giving: strength, connection, growth and the satisfaction of time well spent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristmas list or bucket list, doesn\u2019t matter. I want to see the seven wonders of the world. So far, I\u2019ve seen a few: I walked the Great Wall of China in 1989\u2014with the Italian designer Valentino. I swam the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. I climbed up Sugar Loaf to visit the Christ the Redeemer Statue in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s harbor. My travels have taken me past the Coliseum in Rome on the way to the airport on a few occasions, but I never had\u2014or made\u2014time to get out of the car and explore.\n\nBut from the wonders I\u2019ve already seen, I can say you don\u2019t forget them\u2014ever. My kids are big enough now that it\u2019s time to take those extreme trips as a family; and we need to seize the moment, before they start leaving the nest. Next on my list? The Great Pyramids of Giza, in Egypt, the Victoria Falls in South Africa and Niagara Falls in Canada\u2014a trip our New York-based family can take just by hopping on Amtrak or renting a recreational vehicle for a road trip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose are big dreams on my wish list, and it\u2019s as much about looking forward in anticipation of the adventure as actually getting there. But since anticipation can become procrastination, this year, I\u2019m going to consider letting Nomadness Travel Tribe and National Geographic Tours help satisfy my wanderlust.\n\nBut on the real, the holidays are already upon us right here and now, and I\u2019ve barely had time to get in the spirit. So, since there\u2019s been no shopping or preparations of any kind to be made in my household yet, I think I better think of some small things that mean a lot for this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing says lovin\u2019 like something Mama makes in the oven\u2014or the Crock-Pot. With my new job here at The Glow Up, I\u2019m busier than ever. I have less and less time to prepare for my favorite hour of the day, when our family comes together over a meal. For our busy lives, slow food for fast times is the answer.\n\nOne-pot meals are a clean and lean way to cook. So, what\u2019s one gift I\u2019ll be giving myself\u2014and my family\u2014this Christmas? A triple Crock-Pot so I can throw down some rice, greens and a stew all at once, to ensure there\u2019s something for everyone ready and waiting when we get home tired and hungry at the end of the day.\n\nI\u2019ve asked everyone in the house to find a recipe. Truthfully, it\u2019s a plot on my part to get my family to make dates with me to buy groceries and hang in the kitchen, savoring time well spent together. And to make our season bright, I\u2019ll dress the table so that even our most basic nights feel like a holiday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds selfless and perfect, right? Let\u2019s see if I can pull it off\u2014or anything close to it, for that matter\u2014and move beyond what\u2019s easy and expected in the everyday (including getting those groceries delivered). Because the best present I can give this year is to stay present, instead of mindlessly swiping my credit card out of boredom or in an empty attempt to change my mood.\n\nThe truth is, I\u2019ve been gifted with a lot. So, in every moment, I\u2019m going to try to be mindful of building connection with what matters most in life: my time, and time with the people I love.\n\n", "keywords": ["love", "family", "real", "think", "way", "christmas", "whats", "im", "ive", "stuff", "list"], "polarity": 0.16287475596299128, "subjectivity": 0.480734869705458},

I jumped out of a moving car in rush hour traffic to chase a black dude\u2014Dr. Umar Johnson would be proud. But it wasn\u2019t Idris Elba, who is destined to help me breed superhot, superblack superchildren ... sorry, Umar.\n\nI risked life and limb (and my producer, who chased after me) because I finally had a three-dimensional encounter with black people who, after eluding me for the first four days of my visit to Jakarta, Indonesia, stood chillin\u2019 on the side of the road outside a chop shop. It was a knee-jerk reaction, like the way my body spontaneously combusts every time I hear Elba talk about \u201cpounding yams.\u201d\n\nI just couldn\u2019t help myself.\n\nAnd though I\u2019m fairly certain my unceremonious entrance of dodging moving vehicles and issuing banshee laryngitis screams would have thrown off anyone suddenly confronted with cameras and questions, these men (who were Nigerian, though about half of them identified as Biafrans) were friendly enough to talk smack and take photos. When I pressed them beyond the light banter to ask about their professions, they shut down completely, which I took as my cue to relocate my curious shenanigans elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a story I recall later via Skype to Adam*, a private American contractor who has been living in Jakarta since 2015. He laughs at me (which seems appropriate in hindsight).\n\nHaving toured Southeast Asia extensively for work in his youth, Adam, now 35, says he was offered the opportunity to relocate to Jakarta to further his career. \u201cBefore I started doing business here, all I knew about this place was what I had read in Barack Obama\u2019s book,\u201d he says.\n\nAn openly gay man, Adam says he had his hesitations: \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of debate about the role that homosexuality plays in Islam, but it\u2019s not a chance I wanted to take. I always felt more at ease in Buddhist countries like Thailand.\u201d Adam, who grew up in Raleigh, N.C., before relocating to New York, says he fought for a long time to come out and feel comfortable with his sexuality, and he didn\u2019t want to regress by moving to a country where that would be a taboo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut honestly, people here are very nice. I get along quite well, and religion doesn\u2019t come up except for when some of my co-workers go to pray. I\u2019m not even sure they realize I\u2019m gay,\u201d he says.\n\nNow, two years into his tenure, Adam says that he enjoys the perks of living abroad on an American salary. He has a private car and a driver and rents out a modern apartment in the middle of the city for a fraction of the cost of his New York residence. Recent sociopolitical trends have, however, put him on the defense, and he remains wary of entering public spaces with a male companion. \u201cSince the beatings earlier this year, the entire LGBT community here is on high alert \u2026 and being black, I\u2019m already under a certain degree of suspicion,\u201d Adam says.\n\nHe\u2019s referring to a video recording of faceless vigilantes caning, detaining and degrading two young gay men that surfaced around April. Even though it took place in the semi-autonomous region of Aceh, off the northern coast of Sumatra, he says that there\u2019s a growing encroachment of fundamental Islam sneaking into everyday life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after in Jakarta, a gay sauna party was raided by police, and more than 100 men were arrested. \u201cSome of my friends were there,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re still in jail waiting to see their families. It\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if this was common practice when he initially moved to Indonesia, Adam shakes his head vigorously and says: \u201cThis is all new. Now more people are wondering why I\u2019m not married with children. They didn\u2019t care before, but now the public is being encouraged more to out gay people they know.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was afraid of any scrutiny, he hesitated before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have to worry so much as an American, even a black one, because I have money, I can just buy my way out\u2014but I worry for my friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nLike Adam, Indonesia is a country in which I, too, had very little interest until I read Barack Obama\u2019s Dreams From My Father in college. My first visit there was in 2012, when my then-partner and I traveled to Bali, a region of Indonesia that is unlike all the others in culture, atmosphere and even religious practice. Obama\u2019s words didn\u2019t reflect my experiences there at all, but they served as the undercurrent of my inner monologue regarding much of my experiences in Jakarta.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn emerging center of finance, commerce and trade, and an increasingly popular region for private investment, Jakarta is still a city with a line between the rich and the poor as clearly visible as the Ciliwung River that divides the luxury shopping malls from the impoverished street-cart vendors selling corn off their backs.\n\nWhere Bali is a coastal paradise replete with black-sand beaches and dolphin-watch excursions, Jakarta is a concrete jungle complemented by skyscrapers, endless traffic jams and blankets of industrial smog. Where Bali is a Hindu region with daily puja sacrifices laid at the feet of ancient Hindu statues every morning, Jakarta, much like the rest of Indonesia, consists mostly of practicing Muslims\u2014with the traditional call to prayer echoing from mosque towers at all corners of the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being black, Adam acknowledges that he is in the unique position of being able to use money to \u201coutrank\u201d his race, which I find perplexing because that hasn\u2019t worked anywhere else I\u2019ve been\u2014ever. In the short time I spent in Jakarta, a city with nearly 10 million people, I saw almost no white people whatsoever\u2014and yet the act of coveting whiteness was such a visceral part of everyday life.\n\nSkin-lightening creams are sold in drugstores, advertised on TV and displayed on roadside billboards. Dark-skinned women in fancy department stores wear thick layers of white makeup and colored contact lenses to turn their dark eyes green or blue. And despite the fact that ethnic Indonesians are mostly dark-skinned, fashion posters depict people who appear more ethnically Chinese or just plain white instead.\n\nLike most postcolonial countries with a history of brutal European occupation, Indonesia has a complex relationship with race, colorism and ethnic conflict. The Dutch East Indian Co. landed on Indonesia\u2019s shores in the 16th century and used imported Chinese labor to build much of the city\u2019s infrastructure before eventually slaughtering them (alongside many ethnic-Javanese people) for resisting government suppression in the 1740 Batavia Massacre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat crushing defeat is one major reason, says Samira*, why whiteness is still the center of Indonesian beauty standards. Half Indonesian and half African American, she moved to Jakarta five years ago to teach English after being raised in San Francisco for most of her life. \u201cI went from being light-skinned and yellow-boned to black in the most sinister sense,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is zero pride here in dark skin\u2014none.\u201d\n\n\n\nSamira, 29, says that most beauty products encourage lightness to reinforce East Asian standards of beauty, which are more acceptable by European standards because they\u2019ve done what Southeast Asians have not: \u201cachieved whiteness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of the nicest people I know, who help me with my groceries and pick up my daughter after school, repeatedly ask me why I don\u2019t consider lightening my skin. One man said he would want to date me if I weren\u2019t so dark,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m laughing, but it\u2019s rather depressing.\u201d\n\nDespite the light-skinned bias, Samira is enjoying a comfortable life in Jakarta. \u201cThere is definitely a degree of ignorance here, but the people are actually very kind,\u201d she says. \u201cI know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true. My daughter plays with the neighborhood kids, and she\u2019s constantly looked after.

It\u2019s white men.\n\nAt first glance, especially if you\u2019re a woman or minority in the workplace, this seems like the kind of news you could file under \u201cWell, fucking duh.\u201d But what\u2019s notable here is the ways these white male leaders react.\n\nA recent study shared by MarketWatch and set to publish in the April issue of the Academy of Management Journal finds that when a woman or person of color assumes a top leadership role at a company, white males start to feel disaffected and take those feelings out on their colleagues, becoming less helpful to co-workers.\n\nFrom MarketWatch:\n\nTop white male leaders tended to become less helpful to other workers \u2014 particularly women and people of color \u2014 after the appointment of a minority-status CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf white men are scared they\u2019re being run out by female and/or POC talent, the numbers show that they have nothing to worry about. As MarketWatch notes, only 27 Fortune 500 CEOs are women (or 5.4 percent)\u2014none of whom are black. Only three Fortune 500 companies have a black man leading them.\n\nNonetheless, some people feel that white men are being discriminated against. One Ernst & Young national survey of 1,000 full-time employed Americans found that more than a third of all respondents think increased attention to diversity in the workplace has overlooked white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen white men react poorly to working for a nonwhite boss, their negative, unhelpful attitudes disproportionately affect their female and POC co-workers, MarketWatch noted. It\u2019s not as though being a woman or a person of color in the workplace is a cakewalk under ordinary circumstances\u2014these groups suffer disproportionately from wage gaps and lack of visibility in leadership roles. But a recent Catalyst survey found that both groups paid an \u201cemotional tax\u201d at work that impacted their broader health as well.\n\nThis phenomenon was most prominent, unsurprisingly, among women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reaction some white male leaders have to answering to a nonwhite-male executive can ultimately undermine the company and the leader they answer to.\n\nAs MarketWatch writes, women and people of color who ascend to top roles are not often set up for success. In 2014, one study confirmed the existence of the \u201cglass cliff\u201d: the elevation of people from minority groups to leadership roles to clean up the messes made by white men. The study confirmed that women and people of color are more likely to be promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis (hello, 2008 presidential elections). But if your subordinates are so resentful of your success that they start being less helpful and cooperative, this makes it harder for you as a leader to right the company\u2019s path and makes your upward climb even steeper.\n\nAnd what happens to these women and minority CEOs if they can\u2019t turn things around quickly enough?

After the officers had restrained Anderson in handcuffs, Officer Zachary Rosen, to make sure the arrested man was not armed, decided to run through the four cops who were already handling Anderson and step on the detainee\u2019s head so hard that it visibly bounced off of the street like a basketball.\n\nWhen video of Rosen\u2019s alleged assault began to spread, Columbus Public Safety Director Ned Pettus fired Rosen after Deputy Chief Thomas Quinlan found Rosen\u2019s actions to be unreasonable. (Do I have to say \u201calleged\u201d? Unless there was a roach on Anderson\u2019s ear, we can see that his head being stomped on was an act of police brutality.)\n\nPettus\u2019 decision overruled four lower-ranking supervisors in the Columbus Police Department who found Rosen\u2019s use of force to be within policy. Police Chief Kim Jacobs recommended that the officer receive only a few days\u2019 suspension and training on how to search for weapons on suspects. Rosen was apparently unaware that marching on someone\u2019s cranium is a less-than-effective frisking technique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a 27-page ruling on Monday, arbitrator Mitchell Goldberg declared that Rosen could return to work as a Columbus police officer. Goldberg decided that Rosen used more force than necessary, but there was no evidence showing that Rosen intended to injure Anderson, WOSU-FM reports, which could only mean one of two things:\n\nArbitrator Mitchell Golberg is an idiot; or Just before hearing this case, someone stomped on arbitrator Michael Goldberg\u2019s head and Goldberg thinks he\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaid Goldberg in his decision:\n\nI find that the grievant\u2019s past good work record, and his performance at the highest rewarded level, combined with his intelligence level, is persuasive evidence that he has the ability to adjust his actions to conform with policies and directives in the future as they relate to his use of force in bringing dangerous suspects under control.\n\nYou may be confused about how a video of Rosen committing a crime is excluded from his \u201cpast good work\u201d and the fact that he was fired doesn\u2019t undermine the gobbledygook about his intelligence level, and how he will most assuredly conform to policies in the future. Perhaps you don\u2019t understand how\u2014unless Rosen tripped and fell on Anderson\u2019s head\u2014he didn\u2019t \u201cintend to injure\u201d him. But you\u2019re not a legal scholar, and you\u2019re forgetting the important legal precedent set in the historic Supreme Court case Police v. Every Black Person Ever, when the court issued a majority opinion that read in part:\n\n\u201cWhite people can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nYes, Goldberg excused the headstomper (which is different from a \u201chotstepper\u201d) by explaining how Rosen was a very good police officer when he wasn\u2019t doing the Electric Slide across black men\u2019s skulls, and how he was pretty sure Rosen wouldn\u2019t do it anymore because he only did it once, and that shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosen will undergo intense training for not stomping on people\u2019s noggins before returning to work to terrorize the citizens of Columbus. He will also receive a reduced punishment equivalent to three days of suspension without pay. He will eventually return to smashing faces in the same neighborhood his original incident took place.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Columbus Dispatch, Demarco Anderson, who apparently decided to attack the bottom of Zachary Rosen\u2019s shoe with his face, still faces pending charges.", "keywords": ["know", "suspects", "work", "cop", "gets", "officer", "job", "stomping", "man", "handcuffs", "dont", "force", "rosen", "head", "columbus", "anderson", "goldberg", "fired", "rosens"], "polarity": 0.05969512195121951, "subjectivity": 0.520210027100271},

Specifically, she wants me to take her vitamins, which is why a month\u2019s supply of multivitamins from her company, Movita Organics, sits on my desk. The glass bottle boasts that they are made with organic fruit, vegetables and herbs, whole-food vitamins and minerals, and are gluten-free, non-GMO and allergen-free for shellfish and nuts. But for me, the biggest selling point was that I could take them on an empty stomach, which I have been, every morning for the past two weeks.\n\nHow do I feel? Pretty damn good, for someone who averages five hours of sleep per night.\n\nI\u2019m guessing this proprietary blend must be where Tonya Lewis Lee gets the energy to keep so many balls in the air\u2014and look great doing it. After all, the attorney, film and television producer, writer, health advocate, public speaker, blogger and now vitamin entrepreneur is also mother to two grown children and has been married to prolific and legendary director Spike Lee since 1993.\n\nAnd Movita isn\u2019t even her only current project: Aside from her own writing projects, her production company, Tonik Productions, is currently in distribution talks for its critically acclaimed film Monster, which premiered at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival and stars Jeffrey Wright and Jennifer Hudson.

And the health piece to me is so clear because I believe that we\u2019re all here for a purpose and a reason, and you can\u2019t really fulfill your purpose or your reason if you don\u2019t have your health. And so, for me, the vitamins are a way to continue the conversation with women around how to live your best life, how to be as healthy as you possibly can be, and to keep those conversations and stories going, as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee\u2019s recent venture into the vitamin market is part of advancing that conversation. Movita Organics launched with its women\u2019s multivitamin (which retails at a competitive $39.95 per bottle for a incomparable list of benefits), but has several other products ready for market, including a prenatal vitamin, B3 and B12, as well as a hair, skin and nails formulation we can\u2019t wait to get our hands on.\n\nBut if a high-end multivitamin seems a trivial pursuit in comparison with the real health crises facing our communities, Lewis Lee is well-versed on those issues as well, traveling the country to engage with and inform women of all backgrounds about ways to achieve optimal health for themselves, their families and their communities:\n\n\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve done when I have gone and spoken at different outlets is to bring together people from that particular community to talk about the issues; about what are the barriers to optimal health in their communities, and how can we seek to make the situation better? ... Because I do think that when you share information\u2014even if what\u2019s happening in my community is a little different [from] what\u2019s going on in yours\u2014that shared information can be helpful. Again, because it\u2019s not just an individual choice; it is about our community as well, and getting our communities to support healthy lifestyles, especially in this onslaught that we are dealing with our government right now. So I hope to go offline as well, and bring people together to have these conversations and try to make our communities as healthy as they can be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Keith Major\n\nNow that she\u2019s moving into making health-based products, Lewis Lee is garnering obvious comparisons to other lifestyle mavens\u2014her blog has even been called \u201cthe black Goop.\u201d But Lewis Lee is clear that her mission is to create and cultivate a healthy lifestyle culture made for us, by us:\n\n\n\nWhen I initially started my blog, Healthy You Now, the idea was to provide a platform that was creating content that would help women find answers and ... ways to live a better, healthier lifestyle. And we also were trying to create a community of women, because I think that a lot of times we feel like we\u2019re out here on our own, trying to figure these issues out. But when you hear other people\u2019s journeys, it\u2019s helpful to know that you\u2019re not alone ...\n\nIt is about a community of women with tools to help them live their best lives. And as women of color, we certainly deserve and need space for ourselves as well ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious undertaking, but clearly, Lewis Lee is no stranger to ambition. Neither is she the prototypical \u201cHollywood wife\u201d; even during the years she focused on raising her family in her native New York, she always kept her own career at what she calls a \u201csimmer.\u201d But while it would be easy to assume that she\u2019s gotta have it all, Lewis Lee chuckles at the concept:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m a believer that you can have it all, but not necessarily all at the same time. And it\u2019s hard; I am very fortunate in that I married someone who was able to provide while we were raising our children. I did keep working, but ... I made the choice that my children were going to come first, and I was able to work around what worked for them. [But] I always had a vision that by the time my son\u2014who\u2019s my youngest\u2014graduated from high school, I\u2019d still be a relatively young woman, and I could really go hard in my career. ... I was able to do that, and once they were out of the house, I was then able to shift gears and go really hard, which is really amazing. And I am so grateful to be able to be in that position. So I would say to women: You have to make choices that work for your family. You have to make your choices, but I do believe as women, no matter what your circumstances, you have to have something for yourself. And even if you have to keep it at simmer\u2014if you can\u2019t do it 100 percent\u2014you should do something so that when the time comes ... you can shift gears and go 100 percent... I think that for our own self-esteem, we do have to be engaged in working at something other than our children, so that when they do grow up\u2014and they do grow up faster than we think\u2014you\u2019ve got something for yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee credits great partnerships in every area of her life with her ability to juggle it all, as well as the ability to pivot when things aren\u2019t working out. But most of all, she thinks the secret to her ongoing motivation and success is figuring out what she loves to do, and continuing to do it:", "keywords": ["tonya", "great", "film", "women", "lewis", "vitamins", "motivator", "able", "health", "mama", "healthy", "really", "community", "lee", "multifaceted"], "polarity": 0.22339749536178108, "subjectivity": 0.5181294725682479},

After the officers had restrained Anderson in handcuffs, Officer Zachary Rosen, to make sure the arrested man was not armed, decided to run through the four cops who were already handling Anderson and step on the detainee\u2019s head so hard that it visibly bounced off of the street like a basketball.\n\nWhen video of Rosen\u2019s alleged assault began to spread, Columbus Public Safety Director Ned Pettus fired Rosen after Deputy Chief Thomas Quinlan found Rosen\u2019s actions to be unreasonable. (Do I have to say \u201calleged\u201d? Unless there was a roach on Anderson\u2019s ear, we can see that his head being stomped on was an act of police brutality.)\n\nPettus\u2019 decision overruled four lower-ranking supervisors in the Columbus Police Department who found Rosen\u2019s use of force to be within policy. Police Chief Kim Jacobs recommended that the officer receive only a few days\u2019 suspension and training on how to search for weapons on suspects. Rosen was apparently unaware that marching on someone\u2019s cranium is a less-than-effective frisking technique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a 27-page ruling on Monday, arbitrator Mitchell Goldberg declared that Rosen could return to work as a Columbus police officer. Goldberg decided that Rosen used more force than necessary, but there was no evidence showing that Rosen intended to injure Anderson, WOSU-FM reports, which could only mean one of two things:\n\nArbitrator Mitchell Golberg is an idiot; or Just before hearing this case, someone stomped on arbitrator Michael Goldberg\u2019s head and Goldberg thinks he\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaid Goldberg in his decision:\n\nI find that the grievant\u2019s past good work record, and his performance at the highest rewarded level, combined with his intelligence level, is persuasive evidence that he has the ability to adjust his actions to conform with policies and directives in the future as they relate to his use of force in bringing dangerous suspects under control.\n\nYou may be confused about how a video of Rosen committing a crime is excluded from his \u201cpast good work\u201d and the fact that he was fired doesn\u2019t undermine the gobbledygook about his intelligence level, and how he will most assuredly conform to policies in the future. Perhaps you don\u2019t understand how\u2014unless Rosen tripped and fell on Anderson\u2019s head\u2014he didn\u2019t \u201cintend to injure\u201d him. But you\u2019re not a legal scholar, and you\u2019re forgetting the important legal precedent set in the historic Supreme Court case Police v. Every Black Person Ever, when the court issued a majority opinion that read in part:\n\n\u201cWhite people can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nYes, Goldberg excused the headstomper (which is different from a \u201chotstepper\u201d) by explaining how Rosen was a very good police officer when he wasn\u2019t doing the Electric Slide across black men\u2019s skulls, and how he was pretty sure Rosen wouldn\u2019t do it anymore because he only did it once, and that shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosen will undergo intense training for not stomping on people\u2019s noggins before returning to work to terrorize the citizens of Columbus. He will also receive a reduced punishment equivalent to three days of suspension without pay. He will eventually return to smashing faces in the same neighborhood his original incident took place.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Columbus Dispatch, Demarco Anderson, who apparently decided to attack the bottom of Zachary Rosen\u2019s shoe with his face, still faces pending charges.", "keywords": ["know", "suspects", "work", "cop", "gets", "officer", "job", "stomping", "man", "handcuffs", "dont", "force", "rosen", "head", "columbus", "anderson", "goldberg", "fired", "rosens"], "polarity": 0.05969512195121951, "subjectivity": 0.520210027100271},

Five years of building up black communities. Five years of experiencing police repression. Five years of centering black stories as the way we honor both the dead and the living. We took to the Oscar stage because Black Lives Matter refuses to stop fighting and loving and pushing for the dignity of black people everywhere.\n\nThere is an African proverb: \u201cUntil the lion tells the story, the hunter will always be the hero.\u201d In no place is that more true than American filmmaking. Each year, the Academy Awards are a celebration of hunters and a silencing of lions: a glorification of the lion\u2019s slaughter through the centering of white film and stories. These stories both create and feed white fantasy; they enable Eurocentrism and entitlement with carefully constructed, beautifully written tales about white love, war, domination, family, power and every imaginable interaction, both real and imagined, that affirms for white filmgoers that everything is, indeed, about them, and the stories remind people of color of their insignificance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis practice came to a head in 2016 when #OscarsSoWhite protested that every single Oscar nominee was white and most of the films made that year were white-centered. This in a nation where people of color were almost 40 percent of the population and were projected to outnumber whites by 2050; in a world where people of color were the vast majority\u2014whites constitute only about 16 percent of the global population; and at a time where people of color were unapologetically struggling for racial justice through #BlackLivesMatter and #NoDAPL.\n\nThe 2016 awards marked the taking of a side; it was a declaration that filmmakers were hunters. But the proverb about lions and hunters is not simply one of diversity and inclusion; it is ultimately a proverb about power. It is about whose stories get told and how the telling of stories both mirrors and embeds societal power.\n\nLions telling stories is about reframing who is the hero or shero. Lions telling stories is about reminding folks that there is a savanna undiscovered by hunters, that there are relationships between lions, between men and women, children and adults; there is a search for food and the building of shelter. For black people, there is love, not only war. Stories by and for black people are not fantasy. There is no time for escapism\u2014only radical imagining and freedom dreams for Wakandas and Wrinkles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStories are also about affirming our existence. In a world that tries to erase our presence, our stories are a claiming of space. They tell us that we are not alone or crazy, that we are not who they tell us we are. When black people tell stories, we also uplift black reality. We retell the stories of black struggle, not through the creation of a messianic leader or, worse, white saviors, but through the masses of black people who made up the civil rights movement in Selma.\n\nWe remind folks that when police steal the lives of our people, they are stealing fathers and sons who have love and laughter away from their daughters, mothers and uncles, as they did with Oscar Grant in Fruitvale Station. When black people tell stories, there is the amplification of black realities\u2014of realities yet untold except by those who live them.\n\nWhere are the films about stopping Los Angeles, the largest jailer in the world, from incarcerating people in black and poor communities? Where are the films about the 55,000 houseless people, the 1 in 22 black men, who live on the streets of Los Angeles? Where are the stories of Wakiesha Wilson, Ezell Ford, Redel Jones, Kisha Michael, Kendrec McDade, Anthony Weber or any of the 400 people killed in the last five years by police in Los Angeles County? Where are the stories of black domestic abuse survivors like Marissa Alexander, who dared to stand up to her abuser and was imprisoned for it in Florida, the same state where George Zimmerman was protected by \u201cStand your ground\u201d law as he stalked and murdered 17-year-old Trayvon Martin?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen black people\u2019s stories are told, we need not be perfect to be heroes; we can be complicated, broken and brilliant Killmongers. We can stand at the intersections of black, queer, revolutionary writer identities. When lions tell stories, they are messy and complicated and beautiful and ugly all at the same time. And every story shapes and is shaped by black realities.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network took to the Oscar stage because we are \u201crooting for everybody black\u201d\u2014because through black filmmakers, our stories are told without making the hunters the heroes.\n\nMelina Abdullah is professor and chair of Pan-African studies at Cal State L.A.

She said that \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it,\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, who want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman, so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she said. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say, \u2018You\u2019re too pretty; how could you be in the Army? Whatever that means.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Aina seemed to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable: \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s OK to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounted in her voice as she said that she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative; we are multifaceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable; people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She pointed to prejudices surrounding beauty, like the now defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive or unattractive she really is. Aina said:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Aina has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but also defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Aina also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d she explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\nI\u2019m not ... just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough. I never know where I kind of fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle that most blacks in this country feel on some level every day: that our black cards could be revoked by anyone for not achieving the impossible task of representing the entire black experience as just one person. Aina said:\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve brought a lot of attention to on my YouTube channel, if you are racially ambiguous\u2014like you skew Asian\u2014it can be a lot easier. When people see more than black, they see mass-market appeal, [and] are more willing to give you a chance. People look at me, and they only see black. It means that people think my content isn\u2019t enjoyable to people who don\u2019t have the same color skin as I do. When it comes to buying foundation and cultural experiences, we want someone who we can relate to ... but I bet that people who won\u2019t give people who look like me a chance on YouTube have pretty homogeneous social and professional circles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAina urges us \u201cto switch it up and be supportive of other people of color in our industry\u2014[they] can be Latin or Indian, and I enjoy their content.\u201d To this end, she actively seeks out other vloggers who are the polar opposite, not only of her skin color and skin type\u2014Aina has oily skin and can advise women of all skin types\u2014but also to learn what\u2019s on the market and to get further inspiration about what makes women feel beautiful.\n\nIn February 2018, Aina received an NAACP Image Award, the first social media star to hold the honor. She told us: \u201cYou know, I never thought that social change could come about through makeup. All I want to do is enrich the lives of other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an acknowledgment that this makeup artist\u2014whose collaborations include becoming a Global United Nations change ambassador in partnership with YouTube, and a line of makeup highlighters with Artists Couture Cosmetics\u2014counts as \u201cthe most important thing that\u2019s happened to me and honors all the creators out there that are often overlooked.\u201d\n\nIn her role as a U.N. change ambassador, Aina\u2019s mission is twofold: to close the gender pay gap and to reach out to people and make them feel seen \u201cso that the way they see themselves changes the world sees them.\u201d\n\nJackie Aina, we definitely see you.", "keywords": ["women", "skin", "aina", "social", "way", "style", "black", "makeup", "lot", "warrior", "youtube", "look", "jackie"], "polarity": 0.13574263038548753, "subjectivity": 0.4877267573696145},

My name is Lawrence Ross, and if there\u2019s one thing you should know about me, it\u2019s that I love black people. Yeah, I know people like to say that, but I truly do. I\u2019m fascinated by who we are, where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re going. And over the past 20 years, I\u2019ve written six books about the black experience, including the Los Angeles Times best-seller The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities and my latest joint, Blackballed: The Black and White Politics of America\u2019s Campuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, I\u2019ve lectured at over 700 colleges and universities, traveling the highways and byways of this country endless times. But there was one project I always wanted to do. What if you drove cross-country as intentionally black as possible? Meaning that you stayed at black-owned hotels, bought gas at black-owned stations and ate at black-owned restaurants whenever possible? And what if you did that while also exploring an earlier, more dangerous time, when traveling while black could be a life-or-death proposition? Well, from June 12 to 18, I\u2019m going to do just that.\n\n#TheRootTrip\n\nWelcome to #TheRootTrip, the blackest cross-country road trip since Spike Lee\u2019s Get on the Bus. The blackity blackest since Janet got in Tupac\u2019s postal truck and hit a random cookout in Poetic Justice. You get the idea. Well, here\u2019s how this trip is going to work.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeginning this Monday, I\u2019m driving 3,000 miles from my hometown of Los Angeles to the tobacco farm where Booker T. Washington was enslaved in Roanoke, Va., and I\u2019m going to try to buy black as much as possible. Besides gas, lodging and food, I\u2019m going to seek out things like a good black-owned car wash, or a place to get a refreshing massage. Hell, this trip is so black, I might find a place to get my scalp oiled. I want you to learn about both ordinary and unique black businesses, while also noting where black-owned services don\u2019t exist.\n\nBut this trip also has another twist. We\u2019re also going black in time, and that means pulling out The Negro Motorist Green Book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Negro Motorist Green Book\n\nThe Negro Motorist Green Book was an annual travel book produced by Victor Green beginning in 1936 and ending in the late 1960s. (Green changed the name to The Negro Travelers\u2019 Green Book in 1952 to acknowledge the inclusion of some international spots reached by plane or ship.) It was created as a way to help black travelers find safe and welcoming lodging, restaurants and private homes during Jim Crow segregation. Traveling while black during segregation could be a life-or-death proposition, and the guidebook helped mitigate some, but not all, of that risk. On #TheRootTrip, I wanted to see what happened to some of the businesses listed in the guide. And since my mother traveled with her family from Dallas to Los Angeles in 1957, that\u2019s the year I chose.\n\nSo whenever I reach a city, I\u2019m going to randomly pick an address from the guide and drive to it. I have no idea what I\u2019ll find, since it\u2019s a bit of a treasure hunt, but hopefully we\u2019ll learn something about who we were yesterday and where we are today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow Lawrence!\n\nThe fun part of #TheRootTrip is that you can follow along in real time. Every day I\u2019m going to post dispatches from #TheRootTrip to The Root, sharing my experience in each city and town. So check back often. Also, I\u2019m using the hashtag #TheRootTrip on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, where I\u2019ll host chats, post pictures and even create Facebook Live videos, including from inside my car. And you can also follow me on Twitter and Instagram @alpha1906.\n\nAnd \u2026 I\u2019d like to meet you!\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m traveling through Phoenix; Tucson, Ariz.; Lordsburg, N.M.; Las Cruces, N.M.; El Paso, Texas; Midland, Texas; Abilene, Texas; Dallas; Shreveport, La.; Monroe, La.; Jackson, Miss.; Birmingham, Ala.; Atlanta; Greenville, S.C.; Spartanburg, S.C.; Charlotte, N.C.; and finally Roanoke, Va., with some small towns in between. Keep track of where I am, and where I\u2019ll be, via the #TheRootTrip hashtag, and don\u2019t be shy. I\u2019ll be happy to take a picture with you.\n\n\n\nLastly, if you have a black-owned business that you think I should check out, be sure to list the name of the business and the address in the comments section. Who knows? I might just visit it on #TheRootTrip. So \u2026 see y\u2019all bright and early on Monday.

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

The afternoon\u2019s honors went to actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish; actress and writer Danai Gurira; Emmy Award-winning writer, director and actress Lena Waithe; and actress and activist Tessa Thompson.\n\nWaithe was honored with the Ford Vanguard Award and used her acceptance speech to proclaim her love for fiancee Alana Mayo, saying, \u201cWho knew that in 2018 that would still be considered a revolutionary act?\u201d She went on to encourage her closeted colleagues who are \u201cstill hiding\u201d to stay true to themselves, saying in part:\n\n[We\u2019re] hiding because we don\u2019t want to lose an endorsement deal.

Young people who look at me to give them something to hold onto, that special nugget that just may help them get through.

To be unsure of your place in this realm, of how you will ever find it or how you will ever like yourself, let alone love yourself. ...

Apparently, Ruggiero takes that as some kind of challenge to his authority.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is go home, man. I\u2019m tired. I just got off work,\u201d Rush responds.\n\n\u201cYou just committed four crimes in a row,\u201d Ruggiero can be heard saying. \u201cI was polite with you and asked you [to] use the crosswalk. I know what you\u2019re doing man, you think I\u2019m a punk. Guess what? I\u2019m not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two options: I can either arrest you or write you a ticket,\u201d Ruggiero adds.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me, man,\u201d Rush responds. \u201cDo what you have got to do, besides keep harassing me.\u201d\n\nRush then swears in what appears to be exasperation, apparently prompting Hickman to arrest him. Hickman tells him to put his hands behind his back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRush then takes off running.\n\n\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Hickman curses.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s funny is you\u2019re going to get fucked up hard-core,\u201d Hickman then yells at Rush as he points his Taser at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRush told the Citizen Times that he stopped, but in the video, Hickman and at least one other officer are seen pushing him to the ground, where Hickman starts punching him repeatedly in the head.\n\n\u201cPut your hands behind your back, put your hands behind your back,\u201d Hickman says, even as he strikes Rush.\n\nDuring the beating, Rush can be heard yelling, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d and is also heard screaming for help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRush was shocked with a Taser multiple times throughout the arrest.\n\n\u201cAll this over you getting a ticket,\u201d Hickman can be heard telling Rush after he decided to stop beating him and officers got him restrained. \u201cNow it\u2019s serious, bro.\u201d\n\nRush appears to have said something that could not be heard on camera, because then Hickman starts to taunt him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a \u2018please\u2019 now, is it?\u201d Hickman says. \u201cAfter all that? It was a ticket! And you wanted to act like this? What\u2019s wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo anything stupid and you\u2019re going to get hurt further,\u201d Hickman adds as he takes Rush to the police vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to punch me in my face for no reason,\u201d Rush tells him.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to make me,\u201d Hickman says like a true pyscho . \u201cDon\u2019t look at me with your spitty blood face.\u201d\n\nAfter Rush is put into the police car, Hickman finishes up his crass comments, saying, \u201cHe got blood all over me from his face. Fucking asshole.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Rush recounts the incident to other officers on the scene, he claims that Rush tried to grab his Taser.\n\nMeanwhile, Rush told the newspaper that he was taken to the hospital after the encounter, and that while there, Hickman continued to be abusive and even used a racial slur.\n\nRush was charged with assault on a government official; resisting, delaying and obstructing an officer; and trespass and traffic offenses, but those charges were all thrown out by the Buncombe County District Attorney\u2019s Office back in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice Chief Tammy Hooper said that after reviewing the video, both she and District Attorney Todd Williams asked the state Bureau of Investigation to start a criminal investigation, but the bureau declined. Williams then requested that another agency take up the case.\n\n\u201cWhen that was turned down, I felt that a criminal investigation was still required,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nHooper has also issued a formal statement apologizing to Rush, calling the behavior Hickman displayed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said that she and the City Council are outraged by Rush\u2019s beating, especially since the council apparently only recently learned of the incident, which occurred last year.\n\nThe mayor also issued a statement apologizing to Rush on behalf of the City Council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn behalf of City Council, I apologize to Mr. Rush, an African-American resident, regarding his treatment by Asheville Police on Aug. 24, 2017,\u201d Manheimer said. \u201cThe City Council first learned, last night, from local media, about a highly disturbing video of an Asheville police officer assaulting Mr. Rush over jaywalking on Aug. 24, 2017.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued:", "keywords": ["bodycam", "trespassing", "carolina", "heard", "officer", "shows", "officers", "times", "man", "north", "walking", "brutal", "hickman", "investigation", "im", "video", "footage", "rush", "jaywalking", "ruggiero"], "polarity": -0.17703460038986354, "subjectivity": 0.4769980506822611},

Why would a woman as talented and ambitious as Horton settle for that?\n\nTo date, she\u2019s already held posts as the New York Times\u2019 marketing director for luxury brands, tasked with bringing in new revenue streams for the newspaper. She was also executive director of creative services and communications at American Vogue, overseeing a team dedicated to promotions, events and all client advertising, and was head of global communications at Shopbop (owned by Amazon.com), with responsibility for the development and execution of Shopbop\u2019s global communications and public relations strategy.\n\nFrom Horton\u2019s eagle-eye vantage point, it appears that we have only begun to glimpse the potential for customizing the client experience and for maximizing the profitability of digital luxury marketing. Horton is on a trajectory to reach the apex of the fashion business, and she\u2019s not going alone: Today marks the launch of Fashion Tech Connects, a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring the next generation of black and brown women hoping to reach fashion\u2019s highest executive ranks.\n\nHow does she do it? It\u2019s all in a stylish day\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen The Glow Up caught up with Horton, it was an early workday morning, featuring front-page fashion news: Horton and the board members of Alexander Wang had decided to break away from New York Fashion Week, a trending marketing move in the design community, Horton says. It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked. Internships are a critical part of the process for successful careers, and Fashion Tech Connects is there to provide qualified candidates with both education and, for those who rise to the top, entree into coveted fashion internships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we look at the current landscape of technology and fashion leadership, there is an obvious lack of women of color,\u201d says Horton, whose new executive role at Alexander Wang was reportedly the inspiration behind this season\u2019s fashion show, featuring models dressed as an army of high-powered female executives.\n\nIf Horton has her way, squads of black female power brokers are about to be on the next runway to reality 2.0.", "keywords": ["alexander", "women", "vogue", "soars", "fashion", "marketing", "horton", "wang", "stephanie", "business", "tech", "doesnt", "executive", "york"], "polarity": 0.19978698550127125, "subjectivity": 0.4454098811241669},

I went to London, Amsterdam ... and I would have kept going, through the overpriced splendor of Scandinavia, or the lush, economically disenfranchised ruins of Athens, but Berlin stopped me in my tracks.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a city best described as charming ... and lawless. Somewhere between watching a green-haired comedian hammer nails up his nose at an underground comedy club at a punk squat, and attending a fetish club, where people in latex underwear debated politics before making out in an indoor swimming pool\u2014I decided that this was the place for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been here since August.\n\nGermany, and Berlin in particular, has a reputation of being progressive. With free tertiary education available to anyone, a strict recycling program and unimpeachable tenancy rights, it certainly presents as a pretty picture upon first glance. But much like the history behind this troubled, vibrant city, there\u2019s a wall you have to break through first.\n\nThe first thing local (or foreign) Berliners will warn you about is the bureaucracy. The authenticity of German stereotypes varies from person to person, but one thing that requires no exaggeration is this country\u2019s obsession with paperwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful to live in a city with rent control. Less so when it means filing a binder of documents, and a five-minute registration process that requires a three-month advance booking, a series of signatures and the occasional sexual favor. Not speaking from experience, of course, but that\u2019s not to say that I haven\u2019t felt royally screwed whenever I\u2019ve left the Finanzamt (tax office) or B\u00fcrgeramt (registration office).\n\nThere are just some things you accept as part of life in Berlin: being yelled at for crossing the street at a red light, offering to pay for dinner to avoid the awkwardness of watching a German man divide the bill, and having to systematically flash my paperwork to do, well, anything. In return, I get to live in a city where nature is fiercely preserved and radical queer feminists host summer barbecues where white people with dreadlocks are charged twice the admission as people of color.\n\nAnd even though it has a population of 3.7 million, 13.5 percent of whom identify as foreign-born, black people experience Berlin very differently from white people\u2014a reality that became abundantly clear to Jessica Lauren Elizabeth Taylor, an artist from Florida. Initially interested in just a summer visit, Taylor describes her first impression of Berlin as \u201cpure, unadulterated magic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was Berlin\u2019s radical theater scene that appealed to her artistically and, ultimately, compelled her to stay instead of moving on to Paris as initially planned. That was eight years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was really impressed ... I was in awe,\u201d she says.\n\nShe describes Berlin as ripe for experimental performance art ... but also sorely lacking in discussions on race and intersectionality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome years ago, she attended a prominent ex-pat magazine\u2019s panel discussion about the African experience in Berlin, an event where distinguished Afro-Deutsche panelists were silenced from participating in discussions with which they had direct experience. She says the conversations revolved around that month\u2019s publication, which featured a cover story about how one journalist spent his day with a black drug dealer.\n\n\u201cIt was unreal,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s why she started Black in Berlin in 2012, a regular salon series that provides people of color a place to discuss the issues important to them ... and the occasional trap-music party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says that racism has definitely been the biggest challenge of living in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe city and the people are still very far behind,\u201d she says. \u201cThe German word for racism, rassismus, wasn\u2019t even put into the German dictionary until 1996. All the words used to discuss racism are in English. It\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nEven though Germany has publicly atoned for the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, a political resistance to combat spiking rates in hate crime, along with continued denial of historical atrocities like the 20th-century genocide in modern-day Namibia, makes it a frustrating experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor is well aware of these double standards. And, after eight years, she reflects pensively on the time she\u2019s spent here and admits that her feelings on the city are conflicted.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of this city is on shaky ground,\u201d she says. Her initial infatuation with Berlin is now mixed with tension, but she finds comfort in the black, queer art community fostered over recent years.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I love about Berlin is that you can really be free to be yourself here,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Ivan Mukiibi Serunjogi, a digital marketing manager, agrees. He grew up in an East African community in Copenhagen and moved to Berlin in January of last year for a role with an e-commerce retailer. Serunjogi says that after living in Brooklyn, N.Y., for a while, he had really low expectations about returning to Europe, and that\u2019s why Berlin has exceeded them.\n\n\u201cAfter going to America, I became aware of so many things still wrong with our [Danish] society. We have this way of telling ourselves that we\u2019re so great and we\u2019re over things. ... America made me more aware. I was worried about coming back to mostly white Europe,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Serunjogi believes that working in an international business really helped to assuage those fears, allowing him room to explore the city with an open mind and heart, which ultimately led him to the Black in Berlin group. He says that Googling hip-hop parties in Berlin took him to a late-night event where he met a member who told him about the salon discussions.\n\n\u201cHe had me at \u2018black,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nWith the added support of a community of color, a solid job and a place to live, Serunjogi says he\u2019s made it work for himself here\u2014but not everything is pleasant. \u201cThe worst aspect about living in Berlin is the dating experience,\u201d he says. The city has a reputation of being hopelessly single, and regardless of your sexual orientation, you\u2019re bound to come away with some pretty wild Tinder stories ... like that one time a doctor proposed to me in a WhatsApp message while high on LSD and MDMA (Ecstasy). Classic Berlin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he agrees with Taylor that the freedom found in this city makes overcoming those challenges worth the effort\u2014though he warns it\u2019s not for everyone. When asked whether he would recommend the city to other black people considering Blaxit, he said it depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in Denmark prepared me to live in a mostly white space again in Germany,\u201d says Serunjogi, which is why his expectations were exceeded with the discovery of the local black community.\n\n\u201cLiving in Europe [before] gave me tools to deal with that ... but if you come to Berlin because you\u2019re expecting something better, you\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvising that the best way to experience Berlin is to be open (and ready to be called out on cultural differences), Serunjogi says that giving new voices space to be heard is critical to anyone who has previously lived in America, as he has.\n\nThough Taylor admits that openness is one of the many benefits of living in Berlin, her advice is a bit more practical: \u201cLearn German ... and use it as a weapon.\u201d\n\nAs a newly minted local, I can definitely say, \u201cIch stimme zu.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "taylor", "living", "experience", "considering", "black", "berlin", "city", "german", "present", "blaxit", "really", "serunjogi"], "polarity": 0.09880833077683478, "subjectivity": 0.40610284728394946},

Wearing traditional head wraps, cloaked in clouds of Marabou feathers fresh off the couture runway of Saint Laurent, the two wonderful women\u2014both of whom I\u2019m lucky enough to call friends\u2014epitomize regal beauty.\n\n\n\nIman\u2014well, she\u2019s Iman. What more needs to be said? \u201cBaby Girl Imaan,\u201d as I call her; she\u2019s the model of the moment. She has already appeared on multiple Vogue covers and is slaying it one sexy step at a time on every designer runway from New York to Tokyo.\n\nIn his monthly letter, Vogue Arabia Editor-in-Chief Manuel Arnaut writes of his choice of this iconic issue\u2019s cover girls:\n\nI truly believe that a cover should also encapsulate a message of hope and go above and beyond just a pretty image. This is exactly what we tried to achieve when we invited two of the biggest models with strong ties to the Arab world to be our March cover stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, fashion-philes are hoofing it all over the globe to get their hands on one of the special-edition issues, where Iman shares her thoughts on her lifelong career in fashion, from being discovered as a model in 1975 to her fight for equal pay as a black model. (It\u2019s a fight black models continue to wage every day; just last week, Naomi Campbell posted on Instagram that she contended with the same issue last December when she shot the Swarovski campaign.)\n\nIman also speaks openly to Vogue about reconciling her religion with her career. She says, \u201cIt is an oxymoron to have your foot in the modeling business and to call yourself a Muslim, but at the end of the day, you need to look in the mirror and feel good when you ask, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nHammam, like every other black model walking the runway and smiling for the camera today, praises Iman for paving the way for all black girls. Hamman tells Vogue that she is also fiercely proud of being at the forefront of the ongoing diversity movement. \u201cFashion is all about having a personality\u2014and nothing is as inspiring as the power of being you,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nThe choice of head wraps for the cover at once inspires pride and curiosity about the history of the head wrap. Nnenna Stella, owner of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based the Wrap Life, created the cover look using a prototype for a forthcoming collection of traditional scarves, which will retail on her website for a reasonable $24-$27.\n\nLanding any cover, let alone a historic and collectible cover like the anniversary issue of Vogue Arabia, was literally the answer to this entrepreneur\u2019s prayers. \u201cI\u2019ve never wrapped that way before,\u201d Stella says of the Nefertiti-esque black-and-white silk-chiffon turbans created for the cover. \u201cMy fingers were just flowing, and that is essentially what I tell my clients to do.\u201d The Wrap Life\u2019s head wraps are 2 yards long and between 22 and 24 inches wide. \u201cA wrap is just a piece of fabric,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else we wear, like pants, are precut for us so we know how to wear it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Stella did not grow up wearing head wraps. She tells The Glow Up that when she founded the Wrap Life five years ago, \u201cI was waitressing, and really sad about it; my photography career wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d After 30 days of an ad hoc self-discovery workshop\u2014which, among other things, included keeping a journal marked \u201cWild Things Can Happen\u201d\u2014she wanted to change up her look as part of the spiritual reboot.\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d just get a lipstick or a haircut,\u201d Stella says. But she was looking for that \u201cone extra thing [she] could do.\u201d That extra form of expression turned out to be wearing a head wrap. The look quickly became her signature, and when she couldn\u2019t find head wraps she liked online, it became her business. In her words: \u201cIt\u2019s instantly transformative to have a beautiful piece of fabric on your head.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaster makeup artist Porsche Cooper\u2014a favorite of elite photographers; brands like Tiffany and Est\u00e9e Lauder; and stars like supermodel Joan Smalls and singer Andra Day\u2014told The Glow Up:\n\nDiversity and equal representation in the beauty and fashion industries is a hard-fought and necessary cause, so to be a part of pushing the cause and conversation along is a great honor. To have my iconic muse Iman, and new muse Imaan Hammam, on the anniversary Vogue Arabia cover at once is my wildest fantasy come true. Two melanin queens clad in couture on a total of three covers that will wrap the globe ... I could not be more thrilled.\n\nThe Glow Up couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n", "keywords": ["wraps", "imaan", "anniversary", "iman", "vogue", "stella", "cover", "black", "issue", "arabias", "wrap", "head", "model", "look"], "polarity": 0.19964268535697108, "subjectivity": 0.5408283515426373},

But just in case the schizophrenic news cycle made you forget about the prevalence and urgency of police brutality, this clip of Columbus, Ohio, cop Zachary Rosen is the perfect wake-up call.\n\nThe video shows Rosen stomping on the head of Demarco Anderson while Anderson is already handcuffed and under control. Anderson is visibly restrained and does not appear to be agitated or resisting when Rosen charges from the left side of the frame and pounds his foot into the back of the suspect\u2019s head with a force reminiscent of the skinhead sidewalk scene in American History X, or the recurring dream I have about catching a certain orange-colored commander in chief (whom I will not name) in a dark alley.\n\nAnderson\u2019s head hits the pavement so forcefully that it bounces back up. One can only surmise that at this point Rosen is dissatisfied with either the restrained man\u2019s consciousness or ability to still breathe, because the police officer proceeds to kneel onto the hog-tied victim\u2019s neck. Four other police officers do not seem disturbed by Officer Rosen\u2019s actions, and make no effort to stop him.\n\nAfter viewing the video, the Columbus Police Department issued a statement, saying, \u201cOfficer Zachary Rosen is under investigation for his actions that took place involving a suspect under arrest on Saturday, April 8, 2017. Officer Rosen has been reassigned to a non-patrol duty indefinitely.\u201d It continued:\n\nBased on what we\u2019ve [seen] in the video taken on Saturday April 8, 2017, the action taken by one of our officers does not meet the standards by the Columbus Division of Police.

After the officers had restrained Anderson in handcuffs, Officer Zachary Rosen, to make sure the arrested man was not armed, decided to run through the four cops who were already handling Anderson and step on the detainee\u2019s head so hard that it visibly bounced off of the street like a basketball.\n\nWhen video of Rosen\u2019s alleged assault began to spread, Columbus Public Safety Director Ned Pettus fired Rosen after Deputy Chief Thomas Quinlan found Rosen\u2019s actions to be unreasonable. (Do I have to say \u201calleged\u201d? Unless there was a roach on Anderson\u2019s ear, we can see that his head being stomped on was an act of police brutality.)\n\nPettus\u2019 decision overruled four lower-ranking supervisors in the Columbus Police Department who found Rosen\u2019s use of force to be within policy. Police Chief Kim Jacobs recommended that the officer receive only a few days\u2019 suspension and training on how to search for weapons on suspects. Rosen was apparently unaware that marching on someone\u2019s cranium is a less-than-effective frisking technique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a 27-page ruling on Monday, arbitrator Mitchell Goldberg declared that Rosen could return to work as a Columbus police officer. Goldberg decided that Rosen used more force than necessary, but there was no evidence showing that Rosen intended to injure Anderson, WOSU-FM reports, which could only mean one of two things:\n\nArbitrator Mitchell Golberg is an idiot; or Just before hearing this case, someone stomped on arbitrator Michael Goldberg\u2019s head and Goldberg thinks he\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaid Goldberg in his decision:\n\nI find that the grievant\u2019s past good work record, and his performance at the highest rewarded level, combined with his intelligence level, is persuasive evidence that he has the ability to adjust his actions to conform with policies and directives in the future as they relate to his use of force in bringing dangerous suspects under control.\n\nYou may be confused about how a video of Rosen committing a crime is excluded from his \u201cpast good work\u201d and the fact that he was fired doesn\u2019t undermine the gobbledygook about his intelligence level, and how he will most assuredly conform to policies in the future. Perhaps you don\u2019t understand how\u2014unless Rosen tripped and fell on Anderson\u2019s head\u2014he didn\u2019t \u201cintend to injure\u201d him. But you\u2019re not a legal scholar, and you\u2019re forgetting the important legal precedent set in the historic Supreme Court case Police v. Every Black Person Ever, when the court issued a majority opinion that read in part:\n\n\u201cWhite people can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nYes, Goldberg excused the headstomper (which is different from a \u201chotstepper\u201d) by explaining how Rosen was a very good police officer when he wasn\u2019t doing the Electric Slide across black men\u2019s skulls, and how he was pretty sure Rosen wouldn\u2019t do it anymore because he only did it once, and that shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosen will undergo intense training for not stomping on people\u2019s noggins before returning to work to terrorize the citizens of Columbus. He will also receive a reduced punishment equivalent to three days of suspension without pay. He will eventually return to smashing faces in the same neighborhood his original incident took place.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Columbus Dispatch, Demarco Anderson, who apparently decided to attack the bottom of Zachary Rosen\u2019s shoe with his face, still faces pending charges.", "keywords": ["know", "suspects", "work", "cop", "gets", "officer", "job", "stomping", "man", "handcuffs", "dont", "force", "rosen", "head", "columbus", "anderson", "goldberg", "fired", "rosens"], "polarity": 0.05969512195121951, "subjectivity": 0.520210027100271},

Wearing traditional head wraps, cloaked in clouds of Marabou feathers fresh off the couture runway of Saint Laurent, the two wonderful women\u2014both of whom I\u2019m lucky enough to call friends\u2014epitomize regal beauty.\n\n\n\nIman\u2014well, she\u2019s Iman. What more needs to be said? \u201cBaby Girl Imaan,\u201d as I call her; she\u2019s the model of the moment. She has already appeared on multiple Vogue covers and is slaying it one sexy step at a time on every designer runway from New York to Tokyo.\n\nIn his monthly letter, Vogue Arabia Editor-in-Chief Manuel Arnaut writes of his choice of this iconic issue\u2019s cover girls:\n\nI truly believe that a cover should also encapsulate a message of hope and go above and beyond just a pretty image. This is exactly what we tried to achieve when we invited two of the biggest models with strong ties to the Arab world to be our March cover stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, fashion-philes are hoofing it all over the globe to get their hands on one of the special-edition issues, where Iman shares her thoughts on her lifelong career in fashion, from being discovered as a model in 1975 to her fight for equal pay as a black model. (It\u2019s a fight black models continue to wage every day; just last week, Naomi Campbell posted on Instagram that she contended with the same issue last December when she shot the Swarovski campaign.)\n\nIman also speaks openly to Vogue about reconciling her religion with her career. She says, \u201cIt is an oxymoron to have your foot in the modeling business and to call yourself a Muslim, but at the end of the day, you need to look in the mirror and feel good when you ask, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nHammam, like every other black model walking the runway and smiling for the camera today, praises Iman for paving the way for all black girls. Hamman tells Vogue that she is also fiercely proud of being at the forefront of the ongoing diversity movement. \u201cFashion is all about having a personality\u2014and nothing is as inspiring as the power of being you,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nThe choice of head wraps for the cover at once inspires pride and curiosity about the history of the head wrap. Nnenna Stella, owner of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based the Wrap Life, created the cover look using a prototype for a forthcoming collection of traditional scarves, which will retail on her website for a reasonable $24-$27.\n\nLanding any cover, let alone a historic and collectible cover like the anniversary issue of Vogue Arabia, was literally the answer to this entrepreneur\u2019s prayers. \u201cI\u2019ve never wrapped that way before,\u201d Stella says of the Nefertiti-esque black-and-white silk-chiffon turbans created for the cover. \u201cMy fingers were just flowing, and that is essentially what I tell my clients to do.\u201d The Wrap Life\u2019s head wraps are 2 yards long and between 22 and 24 inches wide. \u201cA wrap is just a piece of fabric,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else we wear, like pants, are precut for us so we know how to wear it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Stella did not grow up wearing head wraps. She tells The Glow Up that when she founded the Wrap Life five years ago, \u201cI was waitressing, and really sad about it; my photography career wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d After 30 days of an ad hoc self-discovery workshop\u2014which, among other things, included keeping a journal marked \u201cWild Things Can Happen\u201d\u2014she wanted to change up her look as part of the spiritual reboot.\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d just get a lipstick or a haircut,\u201d Stella says. But she was looking for that \u201cone extra thing [she] could do.\u201d That extra form of expression turned out to be wearing a head wrap. The look quickly became her signature, and when she couldn\u2019t find head wraps she liked online, it became her business. In her words: \u201cIt\u2019s instantly transformative to have a beautiful piece of fabric on your head.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaster makeup artist Porsche Cooper\u2014a favorite of elite photographers; brands like Tiffany and Est\u00e9e Lauder; and stars like supermodel Joan Smalls and singer Andra Day\u2014told The Glow Up:\n\nDiversity and equal representation in the beauty and fashion industries is a hard-fought and necessary cause, so to be a part of pushing the cause and conversation along is a great honor. To have my iconic muse Iman, and new muse Imaan Hammam, on the anniversary Vogue Arabia cover at once is my wildest fantasy come true. Two melanin queens clad in couture on a total of three covers that will wrap the globe ... I could not be more thrilled.\n\nThe Glow Up couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n", "keywords": ["wraps", "imaan", "anniversary", "iman", "vogue", "stella", "cover", "black", "issue", "arabias", "wrap", "head", "model", "look"], "polarity": 0.19964268535697108, "subjectivity": 0.5408283515426373},

Your activism has already impacted this country and will likely save lives. When I saw that Walmart announced that it would allow only people age 21 or over to purchase firearms, I was flabbergasted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit that I initially doubted how effective your efforts could be in the war against Murder Incorporated the National Rifle Association, mostly because I think NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre is actually a demon-possessed hobgoblin inhabiting the body of an incubus tucked inside a human exoskeleton that survives by devouring the souls of bullet-riddled babies, so I figured you\u2019d lose the stare-down because ... well ... I don\u2019t think Satan blinks.\n\nI figured, if a Newtown, Conn., elementary school full of dead babies didn\u2019t defeat the NRA, then no one could. But I was wrong! In my naivete, I forgot that the power of whiteness is the only thing more powerful than wheelbarrows full of cash that politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio are willing to accept in exchange for the corpses of high school sophomores. You\u2019re actually changing the world!\n\nBut now that it looks as if you are on the path to success, I\u2019d like for you to continue your efforts. Since it seems like America is much more willing to listen with an open mind when white kids say things, I have a list of five things we\u2019d like for you to put on your agenda when you\u2019re finished with the gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am authorized to offer you an unprecedented lifetime invitation to the cookout, excluding the annual celebration in Wakanda (I\u2019m sure you understand: T\u2019Challa issued an executive order that\u2019s essentially a white-people travel ban), if you are able to accomplish all five of these goals:\n\n1. Remember how black America acted after the Parkland, Fla., massacre.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder because ultimately, your cause will help black people, just as we believe that our fight against state violence and police brutality will also impact white communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice that black America didn\u2019t dismiss your efforts by asking about white-on-white crime? Could you ask your fellow Caucasians to note how\u2014every time someone mentions gun violence\u2014we don\u2019t bring up Parkland? Or Columbine, Colo.? Or Las Vegas? Or Sutherland Springs, Texas?\n\nCould they at least jot down how, whether we agreed with you or not, we simply addressed the specific issue instead of deflecting?\n\n2. Instead of Glocks, can we get some other stuff?\n\nIf they plan on addressing the gun control issue by arming teachers, we, of the black delegation, will pass on the offer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea. But when you look at black communities and the number of kids who have already died from gunfire, the fact that some teachers might have mental issues, the fact that some cops won\u2019t go into a school with a mass shooter but we expect teachers to do so, and the weirdness of my 11th-grade civics teacher, Mr. Heisman ... OK, maybe I am calling it a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really terrible idea.\n\nBut since black schools receive less funding than predominantly white schools, we\u2019ll take some books. A nice handgun costs about the same as an inexpensive laptop, and black students suffer from a gap in access to technology, so we\u2019ll take the laptops instead of the firearms.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this will make the world a better place, just think how lit Black Twitter will be!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you can force companies to change their gun policies, maybe you can force them to change other things.\n\nI was amazed that you convinced Walmart to change its policy on gun sales. In your next meeting, could you tell them to change their policy on how many cashiers they have working at one time? I\u2019ve been in Walmart on Christmas Eve and they still didn\u2019t have a cashier at every register, which might be worse than Republicans ignoring the fact that guns kill more Americans every year than AIDS, terrorists, \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and Shariah combined.\n\nDelta eliminated its NRA discount but still charges $30 to put my bag under the plane, yet it lets me stuff the bag in an overhead bin for free. It\u2019s on the same plane! How is this not illegal? And, like Wally World, airports never have a full staff of Transportation Security Administration agents. Half the check-in lines are never used!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear that America needs some commonsense line-control legislation.\n\n4. As long as we\u2019re working on fixing laws that kill people, we have a list:\n\nmarijuana prohibition\n\n\n\ncops being prosecuted by people who are essentially co-workers\n\nmandatory minimums\n\nstop-and-frisk laws\n\npharmaceutical-industry loopholes\n\ngerrymandering legislation\n\nfelon disenfranchisement\n\nFDA legislation that allows white people to make potato salad\n\ncapital punishment\n\n5. Can you never say \u201cAll lives matter\u201d ever again?\n\nAgain, I applaud your efforts, and would never try to denigrate the terrific work you have been doing. Ultimately, we are all on the same side: the not-getting-shot-in-the-face side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d like to point out that black and brown activists have been asking for these same proposals for years. We have spoken about the ease of buying weapons, about the lack of commonsense gun laws and how they disproportionately affect black and brown communities.\n\nEven when white America talks about black people\u2019s need to focus on \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d before we are allowed to address any issue slightly adjacent to racism, it never raises the prospect of confronting the terrorist organization known as the NRA. It never attributes the gun violence in Chicago to lack of mental health care or access to firearms.\n\nIt is obvious that dead black children like Hadiya Pendleton, who are gunned down on inner-city streets, are not worth as much as their white counterparts who die in suburban schools. But when white America reflexively responds to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with that bullshit about \u201call lives,\u201d could you point back to your laudable efforts and explain how the outrage over white lives changed the national conversation, the policies of international corporations and possibly the stranglehold of the most powerful lobbying group in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it might be true that all lives matter, this country\u2019s response to the loss of black lives has never been this vehemently loud and effective.\n\nNot like this.\n\nNever like this.\n\nP.S. While we understand that all of the victims and the activists werent exclusively white, we all know why the country is listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou do, too.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "control", "lives", "teen", "black", "ask", "activists", "efforts", "dear", "change", "things", "youre", "america", "walmart", "nra"], "polarity": 0.030929592959295947, "subjectivity": 0.43710042432814694},

If she has her way, the power and impact of African-American contribution to fashion design will be eternal.\n\nTo that end, Henderson gathered together a powerhouse crew of New York\u2019s most influential black bloggers, editors and journalists for the first Black Fashion History Dinner on the eve of New York Fashion Week 2018. Famed restaurant Red Rooster of Harlem was the venue for a panel discussion featuring star guest Dapper Dan, among others, moderated by veteran fashion journalist Teri Agins, who is the author of the insider fashion books The End of Fashion and Hijacking the Runway.\n\nThe discussion opened with Agins declaring that \u201ccollaboration is the future of fashion!\u201d Dapper Dan\u2014now collaborating with former fashion foe Gucci from a newly refurbished townhouse in Harlem that\u2019s Gucci branded from stoop to roof\u2014dove right in on the subject:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe difference between me and a designer is that they create from their [own] minds,\u201d he said. \u201cOur people need a say in how they look.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome say that Dapper Dan, through his early-\u201980s remixing of logo brands like Gucci, MCM and Louis Vuitton into one-of-a-kind pieces for the hip-hop and elite street hustlers, defined a golden era of fashion. There was a time when Dan was known as the \u201cKing of Counterfeit\u201d for reworking motifs of European heritage designers infused with an uptown swagger\u2014most recognizably his custom leather tracksuits hand-screened with LV and Gucci logos that caused the conglomerates to sue him out of business 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do knockoffs; I do knock-ups,\u201d he told the crowd\n\nCollaboration is the cornerstone of Dan\u2019s business, from his customers\u2014\u201cAlthough sometimes I do have to tell people what they have in their mind won\u2019t work in reality,\u201d he says\u2014to huge corporations like Gucci. He kept the Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row crowd laughing and learning, especially when it came to the subject of business. His multiyear deal with luxury powerhouse Kering\u2014underwriters of Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent, among other labels\u2014is one that he held out for in negotiations, saying, \u201cI wanted a partnership where I can be on the same trajectory, producing with the same dignity and respect as Tom Ford or Marc Jacobs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Dap advised younger designers that \u201ctechnology is the palette of the future,\u201d his closing wisdom was about preserving our legacy: \u201cHarlem has a global [design] currency that we need to hold on to, not let it go like we let Harlem go with gentrification.\u201d\n\nPost-panel, Omar Salam, a relative unknown, yet one of the most skilled and exciting designers now showing, gave a knockout presentation of his Sukeina line. Salaam killed it with marabou-trimmed cocktail dresses, structured jackets and sleek sheaths with embroidered bodices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarlem\u2019s Fashion Row gave us a very bright glimpse at black fashion\u2019s future built on our fashion legacy. The evening\u2019s mission? To harness our collective power to share information and make black-owned businesses grow.\n\nSharing information is exactly how Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row began. By chance, Henderson met Lois Alexander Lane, the fashion historian who founded the now defunct Black Fashion Museum, who at the time was compiling a book project on the history of African-American designers, called Fashion in Color. It was a labor of love, which, upon her death, Lane passed on to Henderson to continue.\n\nHenderson found her calling, and on this evening, with some of black fashion\u2019s most important influencers gathered in one room, she made her mission clear: Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row exists \u201cto present opportunities to expand a designer\u2019s visibility by having them show their collection at events with fashion influencers. Moving forward, our goal is to connect designers with revenue-generating opportunities with large brands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, they\u2019ve presented over 50 designers\u2014including CFDA winner Telfar Waraire Boswell\u2014to buyers, press and fashion professionals. Henderson, now profitable through a combination of speaking engagements, corporate-sponsored events and selling designers on her site, developed by Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row, has an even bigger endgame in mind.\n\n\u201cI want to create a label that allows us to work with designers of color across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to use the label to launch the designer with HFR x Designer collaborations that would provide revenue for designers.\u201d\n\nSo what can we do to support the future of black fashion design? \u201cTalk about it. Even if you can\u2019t buy it, talk about it!\u201d Henderson says. Which makes sense: Gucci is not famous in our community because we all buy it but because we all talk about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other thing we can do is support our own legacy. Henderson says: \u201cWe would love people to download our new book, Fashion in Color, on our website. It\u2019s free!

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received further clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel. So, those in opposition to Stenberg playing the role weren\u2019t even protesting color-blind casting. They were just plain racist.

As the Sacramento Bee defines it, personal recognizance bond \u201callows defendants be released from jail before standing trial without having to pay cash bail.\u201d\n\nMcSpadden also made it very clear to whom he was denying bail. From the Chronicle:\n\n\u201cThe young black men - and it\u2019s primarily young black men rather than young black women - charged with felony offenses, they\u2019re not getting good advice from their parents,\u201d he said. \u201cWho do they get advice from? Rag-tag organizations like Black Lives Matter, which tell you, \u2018Resist police,\u2019 which is the worst thing in the world you could tell a young black man ... They teach contempt for the police, for the whole justice system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpadden also referred to these defendants as \u201ctainted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost everybody we see here has been tainted in some way before we see them,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey\u2019re not good risks.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday (h/t to the Sacramento Bee), the state\u2019s ACLU chapter called McSpadden\u2019s comments an open admission of racial bias against young black male defendants who appeared before the judge in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf there remained any doubt that the deck is stacked against people of color in our criminal justice system, Michael McSpadden just dispelled it,\u201d Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas, said in the statement.\n\nThe comments, along with the revelation that McSpadden barred magistrates from offering personal bond for years, add to the judge\u2019s troubled history of stripping defendants of their rights.\n\nIn July, McSpadden made headlines after a Houston city councilman accused the felony-court judge of judicial oppression. As the Houston Chronicle reported, Councilman Michael Kubosh, who is also a bail bondsman, said that McSpadden refused to appoint lawyers to low-income clients who were free on bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpadden\u2019s policy was to require most defendants free on bail to hire their own lawyer. If they did not, he ordered them to come to court daily until a lawyer was hired. McSpadden\u2019s rationale was cartoonishly simple: If you can make bail, you can afford a lawyer; underprivileged clients who asked for court-appointed attorneys were regularly denied them by McSpadden.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be this hard,\u201d Kubosh told the Chronicle at the time. \u201cThey do this to oppress the person to take a plea or give up and just make a deal.

And with a personal income tax rate that sometimes reaches 57 percent, the city\u2019s population of 910,000 benefits equally from a strong infrastructure, free tertiary education and an aggressive stance on gender equality, right down to the 480 days of paid parental leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have never seen so many dads pushing babies around, without women, in my entire life. They did it in gym clothes, in jeans and in tailored business suits while holding cellphones to their ears. While eating at famed bakery Vete-Katten, I observed family after family divide feeding, burping and diaper-changing duty straight down the middle with military precision.\n\nIt was clear to me in less than a day that Swedes have that whole gender-equality thing down to a science.\n\n\u2026 But ethnic diversity is another thing altogether.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of the city\u2019s population comes from an immigrant or non-Swedish background, and the largest ethnic minorities include people from Finland, Iraq, Iran, Bosnia, Turkey, Croatia and Serbia\u2014with even smaller ethnic populations from a variety of East African countries. But for black people in America, being a minority isn\u2019t anything new. The question is, is Sweden really a great place, or is it just a great place for ethnic Swedes? The true nature of the city\u2019s culture of inclusivity and ethnic diversity is, unsurprisingly, best grasped by speaking to people of color who have made that migration themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSwedes make terrible strangers but great friends.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Patrick Gibson says. The 69-year-old hospitality professional relocated to Stockholm from Barbados to be closer to his son, whose mother is Swedish. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know you, they\u2019ll just keep on walking \u2026 but once you\u2019re introduced and they\u2019re familiar with you, they\u2019re the best people to know,\u201d he adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2011 he founded the Barbados-Sweden Cultural Association to address what he saw as a cultural void among Barbadian youths living in Sweden who wanted to reconnect with their roots. With his son in mind, Gibson made it a personal quest to examine the country\u2019s racial past, which is why he co-authored the book Svart i Sverige (\u201cBlack in Sweden\u201d).\n\nFascinated by the history of blacks in Sweden, in his book Gibson observes that much like other European countries, Sweden\u2019s past includes a chronicle of colonization, slave trading and the varied historical ways in which black people have contributed to modern Swedish culture, even if it isn\u2019t widespread public knowledge.\n\n\n\nWalking through a shopping center in Rinkeby, I observe the infinitely greater population of black people, women in Islamic dress and the use of non-Swedish languages. Gibson says that like many ethnically diverse neighborhoods, this one has a reputation for being dangerous\u2014though I never got that impression from my time there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSure, sometimes things happen,\u201d he says, \u201cbut sometimes things happen everywhere.\u201d He finds the neighborhood dynamic, family-oriented and stimulating. When asked if he\u2019s happy in his Scandinavian home, he doesn\u2019t hesitate for a moment: \u201cIt really is a great country.\u201d\n\nBut while modernity has certainly been good to Swedish families, the economy and the environment (which Gibson describes as the holy trinity of Swedish values), there are distinct elements of racism that remain tangible components of everyday Swedish life; but it\u2019s Swedish stoicism that prevents Afro-Swedes from articulating these grievances, suppressing a large part of their lived experiences from coming to light.\n\nThis is why programs like Melanin, a Swedish youth program that looks at the everyday lives of Afro-Swedes, has become so popular and is so important to changing the conversation on diversity and cultural inclusivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling of racism here, but nobody wants to talk about it because they want to be politically correct,\u201d says Azaa Ahmed Ali, 28, Melanin\u2019s program editor and diversity coordinator. \u201cPeople will tiptoe around you, but those microaggressions are constant.\u201d\n\n\n\nAli\u2019s family comes from Sudan, and they migrated to Stockholm when she was a small child. For her, the excitement generated by Melanin is a reflection of what has been missing in Swedish race dialogue, a conversation that she says is much more evolved in the U.S. because people aren\u2019t as concerned with appearing politically correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli says that when she was a teenager, she internalized popular images of Swedish beauty from TV and magazines, which didn\u2019t feature anyone who looked like her\u2014leading her to feel deeply insecure about the color of her skin and the texture of her hair, the constant subject of curiosity from other students.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s considered normal here is the white body, and what\u2019s considered normal here is the white culture,\u201d says Ali.\n\nThis makes sense when placed in context within Sweden\u2019s history. Despite its modern reputation as a liberal darling, it was only 1922 when the country established the National Institute of Racial Biology at Uppsala University, where objectives included experiments that divided people by race and involved genetically modifying the shapes of people\u2019s heads, a program later snatched up by Nazi Germany\u2019s eugenics program \u2026 in search of the perfect white body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Swedish convention dictates that pointing this out, or any racially charged subjects in general, regardless of how justified, is just a recipe for trouble.\n\n\u201cI definitely get called the angry black woman for bringing stuff up, reacting to comments,\u201d says Ali. It\u2019s a painfully familiar scenario that could take place anywhere in the U.S., but given the unspoken agreement among Swedes to live in overall denial of any racial tension, it should be no surprise that conflicts have been popping up in recent years.\n\nIn 2013 the Husby Riots, sparked by the police shooting of a 69-year-old Portuguese man, shook Stockholm\u2019s idyllic facade and awakened people to a brooding feeling of discontent among migrant and minority communities pushed to the outskirts of the city. It\u2019s there, says Ali, where they feel marginalized, invisible and suspicious of any police presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a gorgeous bar in Gamla Stan, with a view of the Royal Palace, some locals asked me about my impression of Sweden. I expressed my overall approval and, in turn, inquired about the riots. The question was quickly dismissed with a waved hand, and someone offered to buy me a beer instead. Up until then, I had been having a great time talking to strangers, eating semla and deciphering their incomprehensible language.\n\nBut it instantly reminded me of Azaa\u2019s final words: \u201cHey, the way America\u2019s going right now \u2026 I\u2019d say definitely come to Sweden \u2026 but be prepared to play by the rules.\u201d", "keywords": ["great", "gibson", "swedish", "program", "considering", "black", "stockholm", "question", "ethnic", "diversity", "sweden", "present", "blaxit"], "polarity": 0.1584084648134235, "subjectivity": 0.4473367082871216},

According to the Washington Post, in an article titled, \u201cAlexandria, Va., Outranks Home of Disneyland as Top Place to Go in 2018, Survey Says\u201d:\n\n[Money] magazine said in a description of its rankings called \u201cThe 20 Best Places to Go in 2018\u201d that it looked at locations internationally and in the United States that \u201cdeliver the highest value for your dollar.\u201d It also gives tips on what it considers \u201cmust-do experiences and amenities,\u201d and it claims that its suggestions are a deal and even a \u201csteal.\u201d For U.S. travel, Money ranked Alexandria, Va., in first place.\n\nHmm.\n\nAccording to Money:\n\nTo truly experience the Old Town neighborhood, grab an outdoor table at Hank\u2019s Oyster Bar during happy hour on a Friday night. Hank\u2019s is one of dozens of cafes, boutique shops and galleries that line the walkable mile of King Street that ends at the historic wharf. Art lovers should check out the nearby Torpedo Factory Art Center, a space housing 82 artist studios and seven galleries, featuring everything from pottery to stained glass. On the other end of town stands the legendary Birchmere Music Hall, where greats like Johnny Cash and Dave Matthews once played. Alexandria is also the perfect jumping off point to explore George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon estate ($20 for adults), says Evan Godt, a Lonely Planet destination editor for the Americas. Tour the colonial mansion and its four formal gardens, which have been restored to their 18th century appearance. Or rent a car (roughly $40 a day, reports Hipmunk) and explore Virginia\u2019s burgeoning wine country. A little over an hour away, you\u2019ll find RdV Vineyards (tours, $65 per person), which is known for its cult-status red blends.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, I like Alexandria. I literally go there every single day when I drop my daughter off for school. I like Old Town just fine, and if I were a (multi) millionaire, I\u2019d buy a house in Alexandria. Floods a bit much for my taste, but ya know, you can\u2019t win them all. But Alexandria is not a tourist destination\u2014not from out of town.\n\nIt\u2019s barely a destination for people who live in D.C. In almost no universe are people paying money to venture specifically to Alexandria. You come to D.C. and then go to Alexandria because the site you on where you booked your hotel made it seem like the hotel was \u201cright outside of Washington, D.C., with views of the Capitol at night!\u201d\n\nNearly every single thing you can do in Alexandria, you can do in D.C., and it ain\u2019t THAT much more expensive. The article mentions cobblestone streets. Georgetown got those. It mentions Alexandria as a jumping-off point for George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon plantation Estate, which is not even in Alexandria. You have to drive THROUGH Alexandria to get there. Again, Old Town is cool ... it\u2019s very quaint. I enjoy going down there on infrequent occasions and watching street performers along the river, and there is lots of shopping along King Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Georgetown, again, whips Alexandria\u2019s ass, and it\u2019s right across the water in D.C. D.C. has all of the museums\u2014you may have heard of the Smithsonian. D.C. has all of the fine eateries and all of the public transportation, and basically, I mean, put it this way, it\u2019s a fine suburb of D.C. to live in or find a fun and interesting thing to do in the off-the-beaten-path CityPaper. Or, like, to go to a concert at the Birchmere.\n\nYou don\u2019t travel from Montana to Alexandria because of the Birchmere, though. This is like that time some folks out in Fairfax County\u2014another suburb of D.C.\u2014tried to float the idea that Tysons Corner was basically turning D.C. into its suburb. Tysons has exploded. It\u2019s got the biggest mall and the mall with all of the high-end stores. Lots of rich people live out yonder. It\u2019s also far. And in nobody\u2019s world is Tysons Corner a draw to the region.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not judging Money\u2019s survey. OK, I\u2019m lying; I\u2019m totally judging their survey. But I\u2019d truly like to understand how a suburb of an actual destination ranks as the No. 1 spot to travel to when nearly EVERYBODY who would visit Alexandria would most assuredly spend the vast majority of their time in the major city next door that is an international tourist destination. How the hell is the hotel spot a top travel destination in any year? Something is awry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen, I\u2019m not saying anybody with some clout made a call. I do know that way back in time, ads for the Almighty RSO kept showing up in The Source magazine, and nobody could understand why because nobody actually ever listened to the Almighty RSO. Yet, every single month, The Source was telling me I needed to check our their album and even gave them a four-and-a-half-mic rating, back when that shit really mattered.\n\nI don\u2019t know if a Benzino-like character runs Money. What I do know is that every single person who reads this survey and says, \u201cHey, honey, we should check out this Alexandria, Va., place!\u201d is assuredly going to end up finding out it\u2019s next to D.C. and say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we just go to D.C. and check out these places in Alexandria on one of our free days!\u201d\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City and other actual tourist destinations made the list. But somehow Alexandria, Va., residential suburb of Washington, D.C., is the top destination in 2018. A fine city, but the top destination for 2018???? And D.C. isn\u2019t even on the list?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurvey says?

Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, and urged them to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election.\n\nCoates and Rogers both deemed the requests to be inappropriate, and both refused to comply.\n\nTrump reportedly made his requests after then-FBI Director James Comey told the White House Intelligence Committee that the FBI was investigating \u201cthe nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts,\u201d the Post reports.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s conversation with Rogers was documented in an internal memo by a senior NSA official, it is unclear whether a similar memo was prepared to document Trump\u2019s conversation with Coates, but officials told the Post that such memos could be made available to both the special counsel now overseeing the Russia investigation and congressional investigators, who might explore whether Trump attempted to impede the FBI investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nWhite House officials say Comey\u2019s testimony about the scope of the FBI investigation upset Trump, who has dismissed the FBI and congressional investigations as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The president has repeatedly said there was no collusion.

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints.

Fendi captured exactly the way I want to look when it\u2019s frosty outside: Fabulous mink capes with appliqu\u00e9d florals and mink logo-printed sweatshirts came swishing down the runway, carried on perfectly padded shoulders that looked just right for the moment.

As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients.

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf.

Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies.

If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths.

Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["lives", "gun", "donald", "white", "know", "right", "think", "racist", "black", "plan", "solved", "im", "matter", "stuff", "trump", "nra", "crime"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

Our ultramodern, minimalist office space\u2014although filled with laughter and camaraderie\u2014drops to meat-locker-level temps when the mercury dips. Not to mention, we\u2019re passionate about beauty.\n\nOur latest outing was to an afternoon with Unilever, the parent company of popular brands Degree, TRESemm\u00e9, SheaMoisture, Suave, Nexxus, Axe, Dove and more\u2014and yes, we\u2019re still asking pointed questions about Dove\u2019s racially questionable dustup last year; we\u2019ll circle back on that conversation when we get answers.\n\nIn a carnival-like atmosphere that was part sideshow and part science, aestheticians demonstrated product while scientists explained the molecular get-down of Unilever\u2019s newest products for face, hair and body.\n\nDid you know that every seven seconds you shower, you use enough water to fill a bottle of wine? I had no idea that much clean water gets used up that fast, mostly while we\u2019re trying to rinse conditioner out of our hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Love, Beauty and Planet, a new line of hair and skin-care products engineered to rinse completely clean in half the time of regular conditioners and washes, while ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Most of us don\u2019t know that bottles with labels that are not easily removable are ineligible for recycling and get tossed into garbage dumps; Love, Beauty and Planet\u2019s labels meet this requirement and are 100 percent post-consumer material.\n\nAnd what\u2019s in the bottle? All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

It was my first time abroad, and America Online had just established a monthly flat rate for unlimited usage. But instead of starting conversations online with the requisite \u201cage, sex, location,\u201d I ended up immersing myself in a local culture where I ate iguana, honed my Spanish skills and spent many afternoons hiking in the jungle.\n\n\n\nAnd I remember clearly, when we eventually returned to America, just how different the world felt.\n\nIt was the beginning of a long, cathartic and, at times, traumatic series of events that took me around the world, from Mexico to Spain, China, Japan, Australia and many places in between. Over the years, I\u2019ve met other American travelers, many of whom are white, who like to showcase the stamps in their passports and compare adventures. And whenever I end up in a conversation with one of them who feels dwarfed by my global experiences, I see the light bulb over their head dim and flicker with confusion.\n\nAnd they won\u2019t say it in so many words. I\u2019ve grown used to the sort of veiled language that betrays a deeper urge to reconcile what I\u2019m saying with their long-held beliefs about what I\u2019m meant to be capable of, based on the color of my skin.\n\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you resourceful.\u201d \u2026 Not as much as I\u2019d like to be.\n\n\u201cWow, you don\u2019t meet many people like yourself.\u201d \u2026 Maybe you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a long way from Chicago.\u201d \u2026 And you\u2019re a long way from West Palm Beach. What\u2019s your point?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one Austrian, in typical blunt fashion, whom I met while hiking a mountain in Salzburg, used no such euphemisms.\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t take this the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re black.\u201d\n\nTo which I responded: \u201cYes, exactly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that African Americans, and generally all people of color living in the postcolonial Diaspora of the modern world, have been historically denied the privilege extended to whites to be defined by something other than the color of their skin. Complex relationships, human emotions, family dynamics, changing behaviors and attitudes have long been the province of our white counterparts, where we compensate by remaining within the strict confines bestowed upon is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRapper. Preacher. Dancer. Sassy best friend who functions in the background of a story about her struggle, while a white friend narrates the plot. It\u2019s dull.\n\nAnd because portrayals of people of color in the media as well as in film and music have anchored us to a particular time (civil rights era), location (deep in the heart of Mississippi) and purpose (to inspire the \u201cinherent kindness\u201d of our oppressors while serving them with nonthreatening, biblical bravado), there is an automatic reduction in the space allowed for narratives that protracts beyond those boundaries.\n\nWhen we dare to exist beyond the stereotypes long reinforced as the only acceptable means of governance, we essentially commit small but vital acts of revolution, which, when combined, create a powerful movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut black travel is not a new concept, though it is receiving newfound attention thanks to emerging media entities like Travel Noire, Black Bravado and Nomadness. Rather, black travel is a long, rich tradition in which brilliant minds seek out other brilliant minds in life-changing experiences, to collaborate on movements and strengthen ideologies that help to shape, organize and mobilize our own in America.\n\n\u201cA little learning, indeed, may be a dangerous thing, but the want of learning is a calamity to any people.\u201d \u2014Frederick Douglass\n\nIn August 1845, Frederick Douglass, one of the greatest minds America has ever produced and a driving force in the abolitionist movement, made his first trip overseas to the British Isles. While there, he toured extensively throughout England and Ireland, orating on the perils of slavery and seeking support for its eradication. It was in Ireland where he met political leader Daniel O\u2019Connell, an outspoken campaigner for the emancipation of Ireland from British rule and fierce advocate for the complete dismantling of slavery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe collaboration between these two minds helped reshape Douglass\u2019 approach to leading the anti-slavery movement. This evolving position saw him distance himself from longtime mentor William Lloyd Garrison and reject his secessionist propensities. Douglass then embraced a new strategy that worked within constitutional law, shaping policies and holding political leaders, namely President Abraham Lincoln, accountable for the responsibility that a \u201cfree\u201d democracy would entail, while leaving the Union intact.\n\n\n\nIf not for this pivotal trip, America could very likely have been a place where the North reveled in its moral superiority at the expense of the millions of slaves left behind to rot in the South.\n\nBut more than that, Douglass\u2019 trip overseas forced him to evolve with a more dynamic, intersectional approach that acknowledged the universality of injustice, and saw him work to create models that could be replicated the world over to address oppression in different areas, as he did during the suffragist movement, as the only African American at the Seneca Valley Convention. Through travel, Douglass was able to broaden his horizons, challenge his long-held reverence for British culture and policy (witnessing firsthand its negative impact on the Irish people), and re-evaluate his own methods of self-governance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his travels, Douglass found allies, companions, friends \u2026 and experiences that he later described in a letter to Garrison as \u201csome of the happiest moments\u201d of his life.\n\nRealizing the importance of travel in shaping the views that changed so many millions of lives, he later wrote of its importance in gaining a wider perspective on solutions to the global epidemic of injustice and oppression.\n\nAnd more than 150 years before then-Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke about the enduring virtues of Scandinavia\u2019s socioeconomic policies, Douglass espoused the same philosophy:\n\nIs America more selfish and less humane than Russia?\u2014Is she less honest and benevolent than England? Is she more stolid and insensible to the claims of humanity than the Dutch?\u2014What should hinder her from following the human example, and adopting the enlightened policy of those nations?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTravel isn\u2019t a footnote in African-American culture\u2014it is the index that has forged movements, shaped the minds of some of our greatest leaders, expanded their thinking and changed the course of history as we know it.\n\nAs Malcolm X famously wrote in a letter from Mecca in Saudi Arabia after he was exiled from the Nation of Islam:\n\nThere were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and non-white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to those who would look at this period of his life in a vacuum in order to undermine the more radical methods that defined his earlier career, it is Malcolm X\u2019s personal evolution in its entirety that shaped and shifted the civil rights era, along with Martin Luther King Jr., Angela Davis, Huey P. Newton and countless other constituents. Travel was a vital part of it.\n\nIn President Barack Obama\u2019s deeply personal memoir that he used to introduce himself to the American people, Dreams From My Father, he notes the significant impact of living in Indonesia. From 1967 to 1971, Obama took up residence with his mother and stepfather in the Southeast Asian country, where he was directly confronted with colorism, privilege and extreme poverty for the first time, all of which seemed a world apart from his idyllic Hawaiian upbringing.\n\nIn his book, he recalls everything from eating dog meat for the first time to seeing a leprosy sufferer with no nose beg for money. It is a time he describes as both \u201cthe bounty of a young boy\u2019s life\u201d and his first realization that \u201cthe world was violent \u2026 unpredictable and often cruel.\u201d This, he details in his book, was the beginning of a journey in self-discovery that challenged his life of privilege, helped to forge his identity, fueled his quest for notable mentors of color to help make sense of his unique biracial positioning, and even led him to reclaim his birth name, Barack, over Barry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut travel is not limited to those with passports and the means to do so. It never has been. Travel isn\u2019t only a response to broaden one\u2019s horizons, an undoubtedly more recent phenomenon (and, yes, it needs to be said, privilege). Travel has also historically been a response to systemic trauma\u2014where the only means of survival was by migrating to a less hostile environment, giving birth to new chapters of freedom and possibility.\n\n\u201cEvery great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.\u201d \u2014Harriet Tubman\n\nHarriet Tubman, one of America\u2019s most courageous heroes and a future $20-bill-y\u2019all centerpiece, dedicated her life to the underground transport of more than 70 escaped slaves by helping them flee North. This was not a summer vacation replete with Instagram hashtags and personal stylists. This was an intricate, life-threatening act of political rebellion that spat in the face of a legal system that functioned then, as it does now, off the backs of people of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Tubman didn\u2019t do it with the concept of travel in mind, but the exodus for which she is responsible is part of that narrative nonetheless. That narrative describes how black people in America have resigned themselves to the fact that it\u2019s easier to change our environments than it is to change the system that continues to make so many of them hostile.\n\n\n\nBetween 1910 and 1970, a Great Migration of former slaves decentralized the African-American population in the South, where 6 million blacks, exhausted by the remnants of slavery, moved to the Northwest, Midwest and Northeast in search of better economic and social opportunities. During this time, African-American populations in cities like New York, Chicago and Detroit increased by nearly 40 percent, and the number of African Americans in industrial jobs nearly doubled.\n\nAs Isabel Wilkerson wrote in her National Book Critics Circle Award-winning opus The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration:\n\nThey traveled deep into far-flung regions of their own country and in some cases clear across the continent. Thus the Great Migration had more in common with the vast movements of refugees from famine, war, and genocide in other parts of the world, where oppressed people, whether fleeing twenty-first-century Darfur or nineteenth-century Ireland, go great distances, journey across rivers, desserts, and oceans or as far as it takes to reach safety with the hope that life will be better wherever they land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Great Migration was pivotal in establishing artistic movements from the primordial mess of slavery as well, adding to a rich tradition of African-American art. Without the Great Migration, we would never have been gifted with the soul-churning sounds of Miles Davis, whose father, born in Noble Lake, Ark., moved to Alton, Ill., to pursue dentistry. We would never have had the eloquent social commentary of James Baldwin, whose mother fled an abusive partner in Maryland to live in Harlem. Blues music might have remained a close-held Southern secret if Muddy Waters had never left the Stovall Plantation of Clarkson, Miss., to pursue his music career in Chicago\u2014a genre that gave birth to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, heavy metal and even punk.\n\nNew environments stoke the embers of creative expression until they become a roaring, uncontrollable fire. And because of the unique history of racism in America, which forced people of color to go to extraordinary lengths for better opportunities, you will find no greater example of people who have leveraged the vital need to travel in order to create better circumstances for themselves and a better, richer society for us all \u2026 even if it is under life-threatening circumstances.\n\nFive months ago I moved from Melbourne, Australia, to Berlin. I\u2019ve lived abroad for close to a decade now. Each city in each new country has created a mini cosmic explosion of growth that saw me change in ways I never could have imagined. I don\u2019t think I would even recognize the person I was 10 years ago. And to see so many more black men and women taking up their passports and doing the same shows me that progress is real, regardless of how slow and painful. But it also shows me that America has gotten worse in fulfilling the basic needs of its oft-overlooked and neglected people, pushing us to greater lengths than ever before to find better opportunities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world is smaller, and we are taking advantage of it. I can\u2019t wait to see what kinds of arts, ideas and movements we come up with along the way. And while it certainly is not our problem to fix, who knows what kinds of solutions to this current political nightmare we\u2019ll figure out in the process?\n\nUntil then, I say we honor the sacrifices of the people who came before us \u2026 and hit the road.", "keywords": ["great", "long", "rite", "travel", "black", "way", "movements", "world", "tradition", "color", "passage", "better", "america", "douglass"], "polarity": 0.12503549584971613, "subjectivity": 0.45064935064935085},

All I wanted to do was write. Not edit. But after changes at the top, I had no choice. There was no longer a budget for a free-spirited thinker to travel the country and write whatever she wanted to. I could still write stories but I\u2019d have to edit and assign some stuff too.\n\nThe best part of my promotion? I was moving out of the projects!!\n\nThere were two places you could sit at The Source when I got there in the late 90s: in the projects or in the condos. The condos were the five private offices leading to the editor-in-chief\u2019s digs. The projects were six cubicles on opposite walls in the main room on the editorial side of the floor.\n\nWe called it the projects because it was so noisy and crowded. And quite, frankly, it was a ghetto, in the literal sense of the word.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou had all these different people, from different backgrounds, listening to various types of music on blaring stereo systems\u2014and we were all crunched into one tiny space.\n\nWhen I first got there, I had a young kid named Jonathon \u201cGotti\u201d Bonanno sitting behind me in the projects. We shared a stereo. The main part of the stereo was on my desk. But I put a speaker on his desk and we took turns listening to new music. One week, I had to listen to Wu-Tang on repeat while he wrote a cover story on the group. I wasn\u2019t happy about it. And I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t happy living through my Angie Stone phase. (At The Source, an R&B fanatic like me was just barely tolerated).\n\nSo I was very happy to move out of the \u2018jects and into a deluxe office in the corridor. The office had belonged to Roberto \u201cRiggs\u201d Morales, who was leaving to work with Eminem at his management company. I loved Riggs. He rode a scooter through the office and had an ear for music that was no joke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiggs was packing up his office and I popped in, ready to measure for curtains. (I mean that figuratively. There were no windows in that tiny spot.) He told me to come inside and close the door.\n\n\u201cYou see this belt?\u201d Riggs said.\n\nHe pointed to a belt that was hanging from a hook on the back of the door. The belt was so long that although the buckle was nearly at the top of the door, the end of the belt was halfway to the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know that can\u2019t be your belt\u2026\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Riggs. \u201cIt\u2019s Biggie\u2019s belt.\u201d\n\nI looked closer and shook my head in disbelief.\n\n\u201cNo way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it is. Look at the notch. That\u2019s where he had to close it.\u201d\n\nI took the belt off the hook. It wrapped around my waist several times and I saw the well-worn notch that had been punched in with a sharp edge. Whoever that belt belonged to was huge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is really B.I.G.\u2019s belt?\u201d I asked Riggs. \u201cHow did it get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came up here to the office a few years ago,\u201d Riggs explained. \u201cWe were clowning him about his raggedy belt and how he had to make a new notch for it to fit. He took it off and left it here as a joke. Told us he\u2019d be back to get it and not to touch it.\u201d\n\nRiggs just looked at me and didn\u2019t have to say anymore. At this point, B.I.G. had been dead for two years. It was obvious that he hadn\u2019t made it back to get his belt. I hung the belt back up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat belt doesn't leave this office,\u201d Riggs said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot under any circumstances. It stays right there. Right on that hook. Unless Big comes here to get it, it doesn\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI got it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t tell people about it either. The more people who know, the more likely someone\u2019s gonna steal it.\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cIf you move offices or if you leave The Source: the belt stays here. You can tell the next person who moves in here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiggs was always laughing and grinning about something. He was a jovial type. But on that afternoon, he was cold and serious. I assured him that I\u2019d keep Biggie\u2019s belt safe, honored to be a small part of hip-hop history.\n\nI stayed in that office for close to two years. I didn\u2019t tell anyone about the belt. (Okay, I did tell a few people. But only people I really trusted!) And I never removed it. I touched it absentmindedly from time to time. But didn\u2019t give it much thought.\n\nAnd then, it was time for me to move on from The Source. My boss was Carlito Rodriguez. My nickname for him was Mr. C. He called me ASKing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI walked in Mr. C\u2019s office one morning and sat down across from him. He looked up and saw me and just started shaking his head.\n\n\u201cASKing,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat do I need to do to get you to stay?\u201d\n\nBut there was nothing he could do. I was done. I was ready to freelance full time. I wanted to write. Not edit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarlito gave me a contract to write for the magazine every month to jumpstart my freelance career. (Love him to this DAY for that.) And that was it, I was moving on.\n\nIt took me a week to pack everything. And in between sending boxes to my house and letting people know my plans, I was sniffing out a replacement.\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to be able to hire someone, that job would go to the Music Editor. But I did want to make some suggestions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted Jermaine Hall in my seat. Jermaine often wrote freelance stories for me and his copy was always quick and clean. I loved that I could call him up on a Friday at three and have him on a plane by five for a story I was two weeks late on assigning.\n\nI brought Jermaine in and asked him if he was interested in the gig. He was. I gave him a primer on what they were looking for and how he should handle the interview. He went in there and did what he had to do and got the job.\n\nAfter I found out he was hired, I asked him to come back to see me one more time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRiggs had this office before me,\u201d I told Jermaine.\n\n\u201cWord?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. And I\u2019m taking everything out of here. Except that belt hanging on the hook behind the door.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJermaine turned around and looked at the door. Then his eyes widened.\n\n\u201cWhose belt is that?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd I passed down the story of the Biggie Belt to Jermaine.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take that belt down,\u201d I told Jermaine. \u201cEver.\u201d\n\nJermaine nodded.\n\n\u201cAnd if you leave, the belt stays here.\u201d\n\nJermaine nodded again.\n\nThat was my last day at The Source. And I never went inside my old office again.\n\nAlthough I stayed in touch with Jermaine and continued to write for the magazine, I didn\u2019t ask about the belt and eventually forgot about all it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, a few years later, when I got an email that Jermaine was leaving The Source, I remembered the belt and wondered what had become of it. At that point, it had been years. And The Source\u2019s offices had moved more than once.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know where the Biggie\u2019s belt was.\n\nBack in 2009, I called Jermaine up to ask about the belt and he swore he told no one and gave the instructions to the next person in that office, Johnathon \u201cGotti\u201d Bonanno.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI decided to see if I could figure out what happened to the Biggie Belt.\n\nIt turns out that the Biggie Belt was properly cared for by every single person who occupied that office from the moment Big put the belt on the hook in 1995.\n\nI could not believe how many people I talked to who said the same exact thing: The person before me told me about the belt and told me not to move it or tell anyone about it. I told the next person the same thing when I left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to find out who had the belt so badly. And I kind of felt stupid for wanting to find it. It\u2019s just a belt. Right?\n\nWell, this small piece of hip-hop history changed hands so many times, through people who never met, while all having a shared connection to a place with so many secrets and drama. If you\u2019ve ever worked at The Source, you belong to a very special fraternity. And Big\u2019s belt was one item that passed down from the OGs like Riggs Morales, all the way to folks whose names I didn\u2019t know until I started the search.\n\nI think part of the reason why I was drawn to the story of the Biggie Belt is because like many Black folks, there is so little I know about my own history. I don\u2019t have much passed down to me from earlier generations. I have a photo taken with my maternal great-grandmother holding me. She died soon after I was born. I don\u2019t even know her maiden name or where she was from. I wear my maternal grandmother\u2019s wedding band as my own. But that\u2019s it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t trace my roots back any further than three generations. There is no family Bible, scribbled with details from a hundred years ago.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why my last name is King.\n\nOn some level, the belt represented being a part of something that should last and be passed down forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the few times I whispered the secret of the Biggie Belt to someone, I remember how eyes would widen. They would cover their mouths with their hands. And they\u2019d reach out and touch it. Wanting to be close to Big. Even though by then, he was far away from all of us.\n\nI gave up looking for the belt seven years ago today.\n\nI asked some of the Keepers Of The Belt to meet me in front of 215 Park Avenue South, where the Biggie Belt lived for many years. We met up on March 9, 2009, the anniversary of Big\u2019s death. We took a flick together and disbanded. I was pretty bummed. I\u2019d had hope that we\u2019d all be able to take a picture together with the belt. But that wasn't gonna happen. I wrote about it on my blog and that was that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then. A few days later.\n\nI was sitting at my dining room table, half checking Facebook, half watching television. I got an email with the subject heading: I know where the belt is.\n\nIt was from Boo Rosario, who worked in the music department at The Source back in the day. He had the belt. And it was safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI called Boo immediately. Here\u2019s the story:\n\nWhen The Source was preparing to move, Boo was packing up his stuff and other random files that needed to be moved. Then it dawned on him that no one had vouched for the belt.\n\n\u201cI went to the office where the belt has always been. And I saw [NAME REDACTED] rolling the belt up in his hands. I said, Yo, what are you doing? He said, oh come on Boo, I\u2019ll split the money with you. I\u2019m putting this up on eBay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoo yoked up the guy-who-shall-remain-nameless and pinned him to the wall.\n\n\u201cI said, Yo what\u2019s wrong with you? This is history! This ain\u2019t going on no eBay.\u201d\n\nBoo took the belt from guy-who-shall-remain-nameless and packed it away in his stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe belt did make the move to the Source\u2019s new offices. And it was there for quite a while, under Boo\u2019s protection.\n\nAfter some time, things got tense for Boo at The Source. There was an argument over the phone with the infamous Ray Benzino.\n\n\u201cWe were yelling back and forth,\u201d says Boo. \u201cAnd I knew it was about to get crazy. I wasn\u2019t fired. But I knew the end was coming soon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat night, after the argument with Benzino, Boo took the belt home with him. He didn\u2019t take anything else. Just the belt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d Boo told me. \u201cAll my other stuff was still in the office. And I knew I was coming to work the next day. But for some reason, I took the belt home. Just a feeling.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Boo came to work. He was locked out. All codes to the office had been changed. He wasn\u2019t allowed to go into his office. And he never went back to The Source again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll he had was Big\u2019s belt.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d never be able to get the rest of his stuff. Boo left The Source with NOTHING but Big\u2019s belt.\n\nAnd he\u2019s had the belt ever since.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m holding it right now,\u201d Boo said to me back in 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s a size 52. Damn. I never look at the belt. But I just went into the fire safe box to check on it while I\u2019m on the phone with you. And I just got a chill. I\u2019ve always taken care of the belt. But I\u2019m just realizing. Damn, this is really Big\u2019s belt!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat should become of Big\u2019s belt? I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s not notable enough to go into a museum or get passed down to one of his children. It\u2019s just a belt, right?\n\nWell, it\u2019s notable to me. And today, on the anniversary of Big\u2019s death, I\u2019m happy that this tiny part of hip-hop history is safe and sound.", "keywords": ["legend", "aliya", "office", "know", "boo", "learned", "didnt", "took", "hiphop", "belt", "bigs", "told", "riggs", "biggies", "s", "source", "true", "kings"], "polarity": 0.10022150952029003, "subjectivity": 0.4152591903354101},

This poses a problem when senior-level staff with full clearance have to be careful about what information they share with those who have only interim clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of November, more than 130 White House staffers were working without full security clearance.\n\nLast month we also learned that both Porter and White House speechwriter David Sorensen had histories of domestic abuse. This is something that, at least in the case of Porter, could have prevented him from gaining full, permanent clearance.\n\nThe president is presumably allowing people to work with interim clearance, and as of now, we don\u2019t know which of those staffers have since gained full clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Rogers, a former Republican representative who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN last month: \u201cThe security clearance process is critical to keeping America\u2019s secrets. Foreign intelligence services look for vulnerabilities in individuals with access to our most sensitive information. Not following the process is a disservice not only to the individual but to our countries security interests. It\u2019s unusual that so many have taken so long.\u201d\n\nOf course, the White House is tight-lipped about both the security-clearance process and which members of the White House staff and administration do not have full clearance.\n\nStill, we have to question the implications for our national security when even the president himself would not have security clearance if it didn\u2019t automatically come with the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also would not pass a full background check. There are things in his past that would render him ineligible for full security clearance. And yet, there he sits in the Oval Office\u2014with access to our military secrets and the power to launch us into nuclear war.\n\nAs we wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to figure out whether or not Trump obstructed justice and whether or not he was a pawn for the Russians, we need to be worried about who else the president has been running his mouth to. We\u2019ve seen from his frequent outbursts on Twitter that he lacks self-control and decorum.\n\nThe sloppiness with which this security-clearance issue has been handled is deplorable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was given access to top-secret information while working with interim status.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman was also working there without security clearance. She had no security clearance because she never applied for it.\n\nWe should be afraid.

It\u2019s important:\n\nWe never have to question whether troubling news about our sitting president is going to break on a day that ends in \u201cy\u201d anymore. It is as inevitable as dusk and dawn at this point. It\u2019s going to happen. We just have to wonder what that news is going to be.\n\nOn Wednesday the New York Times reported that Donald Trump has twice questioned witnesses about their discussions with special counsel Robert Mueller pertaining to the Russia investigation.\n\nIn the first instance, Trump is reported to have told a White House aide that White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II should issue a denial of a January Times article that said McGahn told investigators that the president asked him to fire Mueller.\n\nMcGahn not only did not issue the denial but reportedly later reminded the president that he had, in fact, asked McGahn to fire Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is also alleged to have asked former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus how his interview had gone with investigators from the Mueller probe.\n\nIt bears repeating that if this were Barack Obama, they would have ousted him from the White House already.\n\nWhy does Donald Trump continue to get a pass?\n\nThis ho is acting up, and this Congress is letting him.\n\nYou have to wonder what it is going to take to get the impeachment process started, because Trump has demonstrated time and time again that he has no business in the Oval Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe does not even care about this country. His desire to ascend to the presidency had more to do with his ego than anything else.\n\nEvery day it\u2019s something, and every day Congress turns a blind eye to it.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see.

And it\u2019ll continue long after the ongoing crisis ends.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of the new Netflix docuseries Flint Town coming out Friday. The eight-episode show has little to do with the water crisis that left the predominantly black city of nearly 100,000 exposed to lead poisoning\u2014yet, at the same time, it has everything to do with it. And it\u2019s necessary viewing for anyone who considers themselves an environmentalist or ally to the environmental justice movement, in particular.\n\nThe cinematic show follows the actual Flint Police Department, an underfunded public service agency (like most others in the city), from 2015 to 2017. The riveting high-speed ride-alongs\u2014which include calls to murder scenes or drug busts\u2014give the viewer an exclusive look into the world of policing and, more importantly, the humans who make it up.\n\nA handful of the 98 officers who make up the police department\u2014the smallest number of officers to police any city of a comparable size in the United States\u2014afford directors Zackary Canepari, Drea Cooper, and Jessica Dimmock an intimate view of their lives. This story steps away from the one-dimensional view of law enforcement we\u2019ve all become accustomed to seeing in TV dramas and media coverage, offering something real and raw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s any of this got to do with the environment?\n\nThe docuseries shows\u2014quite incredibly\u2014how an environmental crisis like Flint\u2019s exacerbates already perilous situations in communities home to people of color and low-income families. Things were bad in Flint long before its water wasn\u2019t drinkable: Poverty has overwhelmed the community since 2000 when General Motors closed its car factory. And as Flint Town makes painfully clear, crime is everywhere.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this series shows us that environmental crises are never the only issue with which vulnerable communities have to deal. Years and sometimes decades of social ills compound to create the structure that allows these kinds of catastrophes to happen in the first place. The docuseries provides the important context to understand the ripple effects contaminated water had on the city and its residents. Residents no longer trusted anyone, including the police department. After all, city officials knew lead was in the water and failed to do anything for months and months.\n\nOfficers are forced to police under a veil of distrust while grappling with the ways the water crisis has impacted them, too. \u201cThere are a lot of officers living in Flint,\u201d said director Jessica Dimmock to Earther. \u201cAt the end of the day, they come into the station. They can\u2019t drink the water there. They\u2019re surrounded by water bottles. [The water crisis] is never far from their minds.\u201d\n\nWater bottles are always lingering in the background of this Netflix show. \u201cThat was intentional and also unavoidable,\u201d said Dummock. \u201cOnce your eyes become aware of it, you see [bottles] everywhere.\u201d It can be as subtle as a plastic water bottle near the kitchen sink or as clear as the packages and packages of water bottles sitting in the Flint Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlint Town not only offers stunning visuals, but it offers a real glimpse of what it\u2019s like to live and serve this community, challenging the stereotypical narrative around environmental justice. The movement was born out of a North Carolina black community fighting for the right to clean roadways. Today, it can mean a lot more.\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nSome scholars have been challenging what we define as our \u201cenvironment.\u201d Is it just the air we breathe? Or can it also include the stressful environment in which a person lives when police don\u2019t arrive at an emergency, or when a mother is worried about making the water pick-up deadline after working a 12-hour shift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll those environmental factors contribute and play off of one another,\u201d said director Drea Cooper to Earther. \u201cYou definitely see some of that through the series.\u201d\n\nSo though this show isn\u2019t about the Flint water crisis, I urge you to watch it. It\u2019s no Planet Earth or scientific expos\u00e9 of how lead leaches into waterways. It\u2019s an honest attempt to tell the story of a city and a group of people who refuse to give up on it.", "keywords": ["flint", "watch", "long", "officers", "series", "crisis", "lead", "need", "city", "netflix", "water", "environmental", "bottles", "town"], "polarity": 0.06625319125319126, "subjectivity": 0.5150795963295963},

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive.

But, beyond that, the conversation about moving out of the U.S. has surged over the past year.\n\nWe\u2019ve read about the spike in searches about moving to Canada should Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency. One report even claims that at one point, the tourism board\u2019s website shut down temporarily because of it. But the truth is that each presidential election year, Americans threaten to leave the country, and literally no one ever does.\n\nWhether it\u2019s because their outrage dies or the fact that moving abroad is a process that takes at least a year, full of government paperwork (literal paper and work), the stats show that there is never a surge of people taking up the expatriate life after a (controversial) president takes office (i.e., Bush No. 43 and Obama). But folks still insist that this time it\u2019s different because, well, Trump. So here\u2019s the truth of what it really takes to pack your bags and take up residency in another country.\n\nFirst\u2014do you even have a passport? According to the U.S. State Department, only 46 percent of the American population have valid passports. So where are y\u2019all going (or not going), really?\n\nFor those who pass round 1, you must next decide how you will route your exit strategy. There are generally four ways to do it: as a student, through a government assignment, as a private employee, or by simply packing your bags and going. Just note, when you're looking for a job overseas, while your degree may mean something to American companies, it doesn\u2019t necessarily carry the same weight for others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you go without already locking down employment, finding work in a foreign country is more complicated than just applying for a job. Many well-paying corporate jobs are reserved for citizens, not immigrants. So all that would be available would be low-paying service jobs. (Sound familiar?) American journalist Kiratiana Freelon is currently a resident of Brazil on a correspondent\u2019s visa. She says, \u201cThis visa allows me to stay in Brazil for up to four years, but it doesn\u2019t allow me to work directly for a Brazilian company.\u201d\n\nWhich brings up considerations of how much money you will need saved to move and live, including accounting for day-to-day expenses. Freelon recommends that you have at least a six-month plan of how to sustain yourself.\n\n\n\nChoosing a Country\n\nOnce you've decided how you will live abroad, then you need to decide where you want to live. Part of that calculation includes whether the country of your choice even wants you there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe easiest way to figure out if your passport will allow you to visit, let alone move to, another country is to check the U.S. Embassy\u2019s website or download its mobile app. Search for the country you are considering, then check for required visas and recommended medical shots. Check if there are any disease outbreaks or threats, potential conflict uprisings and more. You also need to research your medical care options\u2014will you have access to the country\u2019s health care system as a resident or will you have to buy private insurance?\n\nOh, and you can\u2019t really enter most countries if your passport expires in six months. The reason is that if something happens, like you get sick or arrested or go off the grid, that sovereign country can\u2019t risk you being an undocumented immigrant. Most visas will allow you to stay in that foreign country for 180 days.\n\nIf you stay longer, you'll need residency. Overstaying may cost you jail time or even a lifetime ban. If you decide that you want to become a citizen, then you need to consider if you really want to give up your American citizenship. Some countries, like Germany, don\u2019t allow dual citizenship, so you may have to forfeit your American passport. Despite all the embarrassment these political elections have caused us overseas, there is still value in that navy-blue booklet in many countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease note that until you forfeit your citizenship for a new one in a new land, you are still an American and will owe taxes. That means Uncle Sam will have his hand out, waiting for you to pay him what you owe. As a U.S. citizen, you could be fined for failing to report a foreign bank account containing $10,000 or more.\n\nAlso, ask yourself if you are cool with a country's language. Don\u2019t be that American \u2026 you know \u2026 that American. The one who demands, \u201cWho speaks English here?\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t ask for help using the language you know. But consider that you are moving to become part of a new community, and you should put your best foot forward in joining it. Whether you start language courses or bust out your Google translator for each conversation, use the manners your mama taught you and be polite. Also, try your best to pick up the language and meet the people where they are.\n\nNext, consider the cost of living. Places like Oslo, Norway, Paris and even Rio de Janerio not only are fun but arguably offer a better quality of life for American people of color. (The American part is crucial here. Other foreign people of color do not have such good experiences to report.) But these destinations are expensive! You should research where there are clusters of expats living from all over the world, and make your decision based on the lifestyle you want to live. Then match that with how far you think your dollar can go. Southeast Asia and South America are very popular hubs for expats for a reason!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo now that you understand the considerations you\u2019ll need to take to leave the country, here\u2019s the reality of the process.\n\nResources\n\nIf you are rich and famous, it will be exponentially easier to move out of the country because you can simply pay someone to monitor and manage the tedious process. For the rest of us, it\u2019s not only a time-consuming, at times confusing, and detailed checklist but also expensive. You\u2019ll have to file a large amount of paperwork and submit it with fees. And those are just the tangible expenses and don't include the time it takes to go through the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreelon says, \u201cWhen I finally handed the consulate my materials, the person told me that I could not move to Brazil as a correspondent unless I worked for New York Times or Wall Street Journal. I visited the consulate three or four times until a Brazilian friend said she knew someone at the consulate. I set up a meeting with her friend, which was nothing more than telling her why I was moving to Brazil. After that, it was all smooth sailing. But this process involved 10 visits to the consulate and three months.\u201d\n\n\n\nLogistics\n\nThere isn\u2019t a simple one-size-fits-all checklist of what it takes to move to another country. It\u2019s a tedious process full of paperwork and fees that you have to transfer and communicate between two sovereign countries. For some people, it can take several years. For American freelance journalists Lydia Schrandt and Biju Sukumaran, it took them one year. But that\u2019s only because they were extremely organized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe didn't have any hiccups,\u201d Schrandt says. \u201cBut I double and triple checked the requirements, consulted other expat blogs and kept a Google spreadsheet updated.\u201d\n\nShe says to start by making a list of the exact requirements from the consulate to which you're applying.\n\n\u201cAdd them all to some sort of spreadsheet or Google document, then rank them by how long they'll take (i.e., how many organizations or people they need to be mailed back and forth to),\u201d says Schrandt, who recommends starting with the most complicated and then moving your way down the list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSukumaran adds that while in China, where the couple lived for three years before moving to Spain, they only had to get a tourist visa that needed to be renewed each year.\n\n\u201cYou had to leave the country every 90 days,\u201d Sukumaran adds, \u201cso we'd just hop on the two-hour ferry, go to the closest Taiwanese island, get our stamp and come back.\u201d\n\n\n\nEndless Paperwork\n\nSome of the paperwork includes an FBI criminal-background check\u2014you know, to make sure you are not a criminal; no country wants that. You will also need a particular kind of stamp, the apostille stamp, for your paperwork. Schrandt explains, \u201cThis is the stamp that \u2018certifies\u2019 the FBI background check required for residency visas. Basically, we had to get our fingerprints taken by a certified agency, wait for the results, then send the results to the State Department to get the apostille stamp\u2014basically, a more complicated version of getting something notarized.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the apostille stamp step is usually what ties people up. This information isn\u2019t on any government website. Most expats learn of this through trial and error. Sukumaran and Schrandt say they learned through their exhaustive research.\n\nFreelon says that moving to Brazil was a little easier: \u201cIt involved getting a letter from an editor saying I would be working for them, getting FBI-fingerprinted and background-checked, and buying my ticket.\u201d\n\nIf you're prepared and diligent, it\u2019s a four-to-six-week process, and then the stamp is valid for three months. You can deliver it to Washington, D.C., in person, but that means you have to leave the country in which you are trying to be a resident. This can complicate things further, since some countries require you to remain in the country for a number of consecutive days in order to qualify for residency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this adds up quickly. Sukumaran and Schrandt say the fees cost them around $1,000 for their move to Spain, and Freelon says for her to move to Brazil, it was around $750.\n\nSo if you plan on leaving the USA should there be a Trump presidency, just note that you\u2019ll have to endure at least a year of it on domestic soil.\n\nDayvee Sutton is a two-time Emmy Award-winning sports journalist, entertainment and lifestyle reporter, social commentator and entrepreneur.

According to the Washington Post, in an article titled, \u201cAlexandria, Va., Outranks Home of Disneyland as Top Place to Go in 2018, Survey Says\u201d:\n\n[Money] magazine said in a description of its rankings called \u201cThe 20 Best Places to Go in 2018\u201d that it looked at locations internationally and in the United States that \u201cdeliver the highest value for your dollar.\u201d It also gives tips on what it considers \u201cmust-do experiences and amenities,\u201d and it claims that its suggestions are a deal and even a \u201csteal.\u201d For U.S. travel, Money ranked Alexandria, Va., in first place.\n\nHmm.\n\nAccording to Money:\n\nTo truly experience the Old Town neighborhood, grab an outdoor table at Hank\u2019s Oyster Bar during happy hour on a Friday night. Hank\u2019s is one of dozens of cafes, boutique shops and galleries that line the walkable mile of King Street that ends at the historic wharf. Art lovers should check out the nearby Torpedo Factory Art Center, a space housing 82 artist studios and seven galleries, featuring everything from pottery to stained glass. On the other end of town stands the legendary Birchmere Music Hall, where greats like Johnny Cash and Dave Matthews once played. Alexandria is also the perfect jumping off point to explore George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon estate ($20 for adults), says Evan Godt, a Lonely Planet destination editor for the Americas. Tour the colonial mansion and its four formal gardens, which have been restored to their 18th century appearance. Or rent a car (roughly $40 a day, reports Hipmunk) and explore Virginia\u2019s burgeoning wine country. A little over an hour away, you\u2019ll find RdV Vineyards (tours, $65 per person), which is known for its cult-status red blends.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, I like Alexandria. I literally go there every single day when I drop my daughter off for school. I like Old Town just fine, and if I were a (multi) millionaire, I\u2019d buy a house in Alexandria. Floods a bit much for my taste, but ya know, you can\u2019t win them all. But Alexandria is not a tourist destination\u2014not from out of town.\n\nIt\u2019s barely a destination for people who live in D.C. In almost no universe are people paying money to venture specifically to Alexandria. You come to D.C. and then go to Alexandria because the site you on where you booked your hotel made it seem like the hotel was \u201cright outside of Washington, D.C., with views of the Capitol at night!\u201d\n\nNearly every single thing you can do in Alexandria, you can do in D.C., and it ain\u2019t THAT much more expensive. The article mentions cobblestone streets. Georgetown got those. It mentions Alexandria as a jumping-off point for George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon plantation Estate, which is not even in Alexandria. You have to drive THROUGH Alexandria to get there. Again, Old Town is cool ... it\u2019s very quaint. I enjoy going down there on infrequent occasions and watching street performers along the river, and there is lots of shopping along King Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Georgetown, again, whips Alexandria\u2019s ass, and it\u2019s right across the water in D.C. D.C. has all of the museums\u2014you may have heard of the Smithsonian. D.C. has all of the fine eateries and all of the public transportation, and basically, I mean, put it this way, it\u2019s a fine suburb of D.C. to live in or find a fun and interesting thing to do in the off-the-beaten-path CityPaper. Or, like, to go to a concert at the Birchmere.\n\nYou don\u2019t travel from Montana to Alexandria because of the Birchmere, though. This is like that time some folks out in Fairfax County\u2014another suburb of D.C.\u2014tried to float the idea that Tysons Corner was basically turning D.C. into its suburb. Tysons has exploded. It\u2019s got the biggest mall and the mall with all of the high-end stores. Lots of rich people live out yonder. It\u2019s also far. And in nobody\u2019s world is Tysons Corner a draw to the region.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not judging Money\u2019s survey. OK, I\u2019m lying; I\u2019m totally judging their survey. But I\u2019d truly like to understand how a suburb of an actual destination ranks as the No. 1 spot to travel to when nearly EVERYBODY who would visit Alexandria would most assuredly spend the vast majority of their time in the major city next door that is an international tourist destination. How the hell is the hotel spot a top travel destination in any year? Something is awry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen, I\u2019m not saying anybody with some clout made a call. I do know that way back in time, ads for the Almighty RSO kept showing up in The Source magazine, and nobody could understand why because nobody actually ever listened to the Almighty RSO. Yet, every single month, The Source was telling me I needed to check our their album and even gave them a four-and-a-half-mic rating, back when that shit really mattered.\n\nI don\u2019t know if a Benzino-like character runs Money. What I do know is that every single person who reads this survey and says, \u201cHey, honey, we should check out this Alexandria, Va., place!\u201d is assuredly going to end up finding out it\u2019s next to D.C. and say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we just go to D.C. and check out these places in Alexandria on one of our free days!\u201d\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City and other actual tourist destinations made the list. But somehow Alexandria, Va., residential suburb of Washington, D.C., is the top destination in 2018. A fine city, but the top destination for 2018???? And D.C. isn\u2019t even on the list?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurvey says?

And who has been your least favorite?\n\nMy favorite celebrity interview is easy: Mariah Carey. In February 2005, I interviewed her over the course of two days in her NYC triplex penthouse. (The one she made famous in an episode of MTV Cribs.) Stay tuned for that. Tupac is involved.\n\nBut my least favorite celebrity? That\u2019s tough. Honestly, there are so many celebrities I\u2019ve met that could qualify as the absolute worst.\n\nBut if I\u2019m being honest, there is one person who tops all when it comes to the ranking of OMG-please-get-me-out-of-here interviews.\n\nSean \u201cPuff Daddy-Puffy-P. Diddy-Diddy-\u201d Combs takes the award for Most Exasperating Person I Have Ever Had To Interview Ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are three (yes, THREE) times that this man has made me want to pull my hair out. (Or better yet, his.)\n\nPart One: That time I damn near went into labor in his trailer. And then got chased by the paparazzi.\n\n2007. Los Angeles, California. I was pregnant with my now 8 year-old. I kept my pregnancy very hush-hush. I was a full time freelancer for Vibe, The Source and XXL. Rap magazines don\u2019t give assignments to wobbly pregnant women no matter how much time they\u2019ve got in the game. So I made all kinds of excuses not to meet with any of my editors in person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got an assignment for GIANT magazine, a cover story on Sean \u201cPuff Daddy-Puffy-Puff-P.Diddy-Diddy-Combs. (My generation calls him Puff.)\n\nI sighed when I got the call. I still hadn\u2019t forgiven him for\u2026well. I\u2019ll tell you that next week. Anyway, I hopped on the plane to LA. The plan was to interview him a few times over the course of a few days. LA was hotter than usual and I was grumpy and cranky and pregnant.\n\nDay one came and went: no Puffy interview.\n\nDay two came and went: no Puffy interview.\n\nDay three came and went: no Puffy interview.\n\nI called my editor and told him: I\u2019m out. Flight\u2019s tomorrow back to Jersey. Sorry this didn't work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy editor asked me to stay an extra two days. Puff would be ready. Did I mention I was grumpy, cranky and pregnant? But I agreed. The next morning, Puff\u2019s people sent a car to my hotel to bring me to the set of the music video he was shooting. (I\u2019m pretty sure it was a song with Christina Aguilera from his Press Play album.)\n\nI got to the set early. I was scheduled to interview Puff at 11 am, during a break in shooting and then once more during his lunch break.\n\n11am came and went. No Puff.\n\nLunchtime came and went. Still no Puff.\n\nI\u2019m getting more and more pissed by the minute. The only place to sit was far away from where the action was. And out-of-sight meant out-of-mind so I stood up to make sure his people could see me waiting. Did I mention I was very pregnant?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFOUR PM AND NO PUFF.\n\nFIVE PM AND NO PUFF.\n\nSIX PM AND NO PUFF.\n\nI called for my car to return, grabbed my stuff and left. I got in the back seat when the car pulled up and put my head back to rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI texted my editor: I\u2019m out. I waited for ten hours. No Puff.\n\nMy editor called and begged me to go back. He said he had just spoken to Puff and he swore up and down he was ready.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s just straight up disrespectful to keep me waiting that long.\u201d You need to find another writer to do this story. I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a red light, the driver\u2019s cell phone rang. He answered it.\n\n\u201cNo not yet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAbout 15 minutes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOkay, I will,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, when the light turned green, he hit a sharp U-turn.\n\n\u201cIs there traffic ahead?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are you turning around?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Combs has instructed me to bring you back.\u201d\n\nI sat up, tears springing to my eyes.\n\n\u201cNO,\u201d I said. \u201cTake me to my hotel!!\u201d\n\nThe driver held up his phone.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, Mr. Combs said I have to\u2014\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck WHAT he said. Take me to my hotel, now!\u201d\n\nNo response. He sped back to the studio and pulled over to let me out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nI stayed in the car and called my editor. He asked me to please go back. I took a deep breath and wobbled back inside. Puff\u2019s rep met me in the lobby and walked me out to Puffy\u2019s trailer on the sound stage. She walked up the steps, knocked and then slowly opened the door. She asked someone if he was ready and then she stepped back and urged me to go inside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, at this point in my career, I had perfected my First Few Seconds Of Meeting A Celebrity You Are About To Interview.\n\nHere\u2019s what you do.\n\n1.

When the celebrity approaches, you stick out your hand and give a firm businesslike shake and you say Hey, I\u2019m Aliya. Nice to meet you. Are you ready?\n\nI didn\u2019t do any of that shit when I walked in.\n\nI pushed open the door and looked around the trailer.\n\n\u201cIs he ready?\u201d I asked. Someone pointed to a back bedroom and said he would be out soon. I looked and saw Puff there, on the phone. I walked into the doorway and just stood there, glaring at him. Puff looked up and his eyes widened. He looked at my bulging belly and quickly got off the phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d he said. \u201cI ain\u2019t know you was um\u2014Shit. Sit down!\u201d\n\nHe quickly pulled out a chair and eased me into it.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve been here since\u2014\n\n\u201cSince 9 this morning,\u201d I said, kicking off my shoes.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d Puff said.\n\nAn assistant brought in a tray of fresh fruit, Champagne and two flutes. He poured a glass and started to hand it to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh. Wait. So no Champagne, right?\u201d he asked.\n\nI just looked at him.\n\n\u201cRight, right!\u201d he said, moving the drinks and leaving the fruit.\n\nI turned on my recorder, got out my questions and started the interview.\n\n20 minutes later, the music video director sent someone to pick him up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Puff said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\n90 minutes later, the video was wrapping up and Puff returned.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can finish up the interview at my spot.\u201d\n\nWe went outside and his personal driver jumped out and held open the backdoor of Puff\u2019s Bentley and we climbed inside. I noticed he had customized plates that said Puff (or was it Diddy? Or Puffy? Or P. Diddy? I don\u2019t remember. )\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou aiight?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nWe pulled up to the Chateau Marmont and walked back to his private bungalow. I got comfortable in the kitchen and we finished the interview. By the time we were done, it was 2 in the morning. (He made me listen to the entire album.) I was utterly exhausted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I started packing up, I picked up my phone to get a car service to pick me up.\n\n\u201cI got you,\u201d said Puff. \u201cMy driver is gonna take you back to your hotel.\u201d\n\nI went outside, got in the backseat of the Bentley and promptly fell asleep.

There\u2019s no one in here!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don't know that,\u201d said the driver. \u201cUsually Mr. Combs is in the car.\u201d\n\nI remembered the personalized plates and shook my head. Who does that? The driver continued speeding. There were cars on either side of us, trying to keep up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is some fucking bullshit.\n\nI dropped my head into my lap and grabbed the just-in-case-I-vomit plastic bag I took everywhere and tried not to throw up. I stayed still until I could feel the car slowing down. I looked up and we were on a residential street near my hotel.\n\n\u201cAre they gone?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank God,\u201d I whispered as I started to gather my stuff.\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am. They stopped following us so they can be at the hotel entrance when you get out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait. What?\n\nI didn\u2019t even have time to try and figure out what the hell he was talking about. I could hear loud voices yelling out Diddy! Over here!\n\nI pushed open the curtain on the window of the Bentley and there was a face right in front of me, pushing against the car door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI yelped.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get out!\u201d I said to the driver.\n\nThe driver got out of the car and I heard him yelling at the photographers huddled near the car door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Combs is not here!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThis is not Mr. Combs.\u201d\n\nThe driver opened my door and I could see camera lenses and flashing bulbs. There was also a small crowd gathered outside the hotel, waiting to see who would get out of the car.\n\nI got out, belly first. My hair was all over the place. I was barefoot because my feet had swollen up after standing all day and they wouldn\u2019t fit back in my shoes. So I carried them in my hand. I was holding my plastic just-in-case-I-throw-up bag in one hand and my laptop bag in the other. My hair was everywhere from my brief nap in the backseat and my eyes had raccoon-style mascara smudges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, I was standing upright and facing the photographers.\n\nAnd all of the action stopped. The photographers put their cameras down and looked me up and down.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the photographers asked.\n\nI sighed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody,\u201d I said.\n\nThe photographers grumbled and started walking away.

It is, however, still affirming when we hear those words used by someone who has held a high position in our national government\u2014say, for instance, a former CIA director.\n\nJohn Brennan\u2014who served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency from March 2013 until January 2017\u2014made an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Deadline: White House on Friday, during which he expressed concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s ability to effectively deal with the threat that Russia poses to the United States.\n\nBrennan, who held senior security positions under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, previously expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s understanding of the Russian threat just five days before his inauguration.\n\nDeadline\u2019s Nicolle Wallace asked Brennan what keeps him up at night or wakes him up with a start in the middle of the night, and he said, \u201cIt is no secret to anybody that Donald Trump was ill-prepared and inexperienced in terms of dealing with matters that a head of state needs to deal with.\n\n\u201cI think this is now coming to roost, and I am really worried, particularly the reports of the last couple of days; I think he must be feeling the pressure,\u201d Brennan continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me \u2026 I had been very angry at Donald Trump for the things he said and the things he did.

He continued:\n\nI\u2019m hoping that those in Congress as well as the 30 percent of Americans out there who still believe in what Mr. Trump is saying will look past that and say, \u201cAre we willing doing what we need to do as a country to protect ourselves, and ensuring that our children and grandchildren are going to remain safe, secure and prosperous in the future?\u201d I have my serious, serious doubts, and the longer this goes on, the worse it\u2019s going to get.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI couldn\u2019t have said it better myself.", "keywords": ["donald", "brennan", "unethical", "director", "cia", "think", "inexperienced", "trumps", "needs", "things", "president", "going", "inept", "unstable", "trump"], "polarity": 0.03666666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.4867829457364342},

Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness. So her visit to Parkland wasn\u2019t any more or any less useless than usual. Her uselessness is both hilarious and dangerous\u2014oh so fucking dangerous\u2014but it does have integrity. You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy. America has and even creates space for useless white people to survive and thrive. If this secretary of education thing doesn\u2019t work out, she could always follow the footsteps of other useless white women and maybe sue the University of Texas for not admitting her. Or perhaps she could be a rapper. The sky is the limit for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActually, that\u2019s a lie. Jared Kushner is her ceiling, because she\u2019ll never be more useless than he is.

The 19-year-old was driving with her 15-year-old friend when the car\u2019s tire went flat and the duo pulled off the side of the road. After a stranger drove Miller\u2019s friend to get assistance from her family after they found that the spare was also flat, Miller waited in the car and eventually passed out with the car running, doors locked, music blasting and a gun in her lap.\n\n\n\nWhen her relatives arrived, they found that they couldn\u2019t wake her up and decided to call 911. Four Riverside police officers arrived on the scene with their guns drawn after being made aware that Miller had a gun. Attempts to wake up the teenager were unsuccessful, so the officers decided to force their way into the vehicle in fear that Miller might be in need of medical attention. One of the officers smashed the driver\u2019s-side window, which startled Miller. What exactly took place at that moment remains up for debate. However, police fired 23 shots, with Miller being struck 12 times, including four in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we discuss the growing list of African Americans who have been shot down by police, the story of Tyisha Miller is often overlooked. But thanks to Gus Krieger\u2019s film My Name Is Myeisha\u2014based on Rickerby Hinds\u2019 stage play Dreamscape\u2014it\u2019s a two-decade-old story that we won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you will not see another movie like My Name Is Myeisha. The film, which premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival, which focuses on low-budget independent films, takes on the narrative of police brutality against African Americans and spins it on its head. Unlike other movies that have tackled the epidemic of police officers gunning down African Americans, My Name Is Myeisha takes a totally different approach that is both unique and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nStarring Rhaechyl Walker in the lead role of Myeisha, the film is an artistic revelation that uses hip-hop, spoken-word poetry and dream sequences to recount the final moments of the character\u2019s time on earth before a hail of bullets took her life. The movie is a fictionalized telling of Tyisha\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was unfamiliar with the story of Tyisha Miller,\u201d Walker, who also played Myeisha in the stage play, tells The Root. \u201cWhen Rickerby sent me the script is when I did my research, and it turned my life upside down in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nWalker delivers a zestful performance that outlines Myeisha\u2019s aspirations through dream sequences that happen to coincide with the number of times that she was shot. Instead of being about another slain African American defined by their death, My Name Is Myeisha sets out to tell the story of a young black woman\u2019s aspirations that were tragically cut short before she had the opportunity to see them come to fruition.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique method of storytelling that translates well with the charismatic Walker and her co-star, John Merchant, dominating the screen time. Merchant is especially integral to the film because he plays multiple characters and is the creative force behind each sequence. It\u2019s a tragic hip-hop musical that makes excellent use of its minimal resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Walker, it also proved to be therapeutic and helped her rediscover who she was.\n\n\u201cIt was my real introduction to hip-hop,\u201d Walker reveals. \u201cOf course I heard it, but I didn\u2019t grow up listening to it. I had this idea in my mind that if you listen to hip-hop, you were a certain type of person. It was really naive, but when I met John, and doing this play, I was able to rediscover what hip-hop really is, and it was a whole new world. I didn\u2019t know there was this place I could belong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly engaging as we get to look at Myeisha\u2019s past, present and what could have been her future. Although it\u2019s fictional, one has to wonder just how much was taken away from the real Tyisha Miller that fateful night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final sequence is especially traumatic as a re-enactment of the moments leading up to the shooting finds Myeisha on the outside looking in while the bullets tear through her body. While discussing this, Walker is nearly brought to tears, despite having been involved with the play for five years before filming the movie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult for me to watch. Even with the first gunshot, and she falls back on the slab, I lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last 10 minutes have a lot of emotion, anger, hurt and happiness. We get to see Myeisha\u2019s life through her eyes, but it\u2019s painful to know that this is still happening today. I hope the people who see this are angry, and I hope they want to do something about these police shootings.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s performance as Myeisha won her the Slamdance Acting Award, while the film took home the Audience Award in the Beyond Feature category. It\u2019s well-deserved because My Name Is Myeisha is both a beautiful and a heartbreaking piece of art rooted in reality. It may not hit movie theaters because of the budgetary constraints, but it has a ton of heart and is worth going out of your way to find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing film and the way stories are told,\u201d Walker says. \u201cA hip-hop musical?

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints.

Fendi captured exactly the way I want to look when it\u2019s frosty outside: Fabulous mink capes with appliqu\u00e9d florals and mink logo-printed sweatshirts came swishing down the runway, carried on perfectly padded shoulders that looked just right for the moment.

But the collection never quite seems to get its props, likely because the label lacks the flash of a star designer or the power derived from dressing celebrities necessary for a fashion house to capture a place in pop culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I do like its take on dressing women\u2014it\u2019s sensible and sexy in the same breath\u2014with wonderful choices for women who wear the hijab. Too often, this crucial segment of designers\u2019 clientele is not acknowledged on American or European runways.\n\nConservative Muslim women account for $266 billion (yes, BILLION) of the global clothing and footwear business. As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients. Never would you have seen a hijab-wearing model on the runways, until Dolce & Gabbana broke that barrier back in 2016.

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

She is the author of the Amazon No. 1 best-selling book The One Week Budget: Learn to Create Your Money Management System in 7 Days or Less! and creator of the Live Richer Challenge, a series of 22-day courses, which to date have helped revolutionize the financial habits of more than 500,00 women from all 50 states and 100 countries.\n\n\n\nEver the teacher, Aliche tells The Glow Up she created the challenge to give women access to \u201cknowledge and community ... because that\u2019s where we came from as Africans.\u201d\n\nAnd if it takes a village, you can count on Aliche to build one; the Live Richer Challenge comes with a 270,000-strong 24-7 Facebook support group called the Dream Catchers.\n\nThe Live Richer Challenge starts with creating the \u201cWealthy Mindset.\u201d Step 1 is calculating the worth of your home\u2014which goes far beyond just the property you own. Aliche asks me, if I were to cash them in today, do I know the value of my jewelry or individual retirement account and insurance policies? Admittedly, I don\u2019t. But insurance and IRAs figure largely in individual net worth. According to the Budgetnista, most policies are worth 50 percent or less if cashed in before term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy day 2, you\u2019ll know your net worth and the difference between being able to pay for something versus truly being able to afford something.

A billion-dollar venture capital business is the next big score for the coach of the Dream Catcher team.\n\nLess than 1 percent of minority businesses pass the $1 million mark in funding; a figure Aliche repeats several times, in defiance and disbelief.

I can\u2019t imagine a media outlet you could work for today where you hand over your business card and people sincerely look like they\u2019re about to faint.\n\nI didn\u2019t have business cards right away. So when I first started, if I went out to an industry event and met someone and told them where I worked, I would get these flat looks of disbelief. Yeah, right. This little freckle-faced chick with glasses and braces and baby dreads works at The Source. HA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then I got my business cards. And everything changed. The cards were made of heavy, quality stock with a raised logo. And my name\u2014Aliya S. King\u2014was dead center.\n\nI would hand over that card to a rapper, a fellow writer, a music executive or a die-hard fan of the magazine and they would look down and then do a double take. You would think I was Moses handing down the 10 Commandments. It was actually so bad that sometimes I would purposely tell people I just worked at \u201ca magazine\u201d without being specific.\n\nI learned quickly that I literally had to be careful where I whipped out the fact that I worked at The Source. The business cards were more than just information\u2014they were keys to the VIP section of any nightclub\u2014but they also could bring unwanted attention as well. One night, at a strip club in The Bronx, (don\u2019t ask), I gave someone my card and the news that someone from The Source was in the building traveled like lightening. Before I could process what was happening, a few would-be rappers who wanted to be in the Unsigned Hype column besieged me, pressing their cassette tape demos into my hand. (Little did they know, their tapes were added to the contractor size garbage bags full of Unsigned Hype submissions that sat on the floor of my office. I had two full time interns whose sole responsibility was to listen to the first thirty seconds of every tape and see if they heard anything good.) I nodded and smiled and put the tapes in my bag, promising to take a listen. Yet knowing that I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, I heard from someone else in the club that a rapper (who shall remain nameless) was looking for \u201cthe girl from The Source\u201d to complain about a low mic rating he\u2019d received in the latest issue. I heard he was drunk, belligerent and pissed off. I made my way to the exit and got my ass back to Brooklyn. (He would later take out his anger on one of my coworkers instead, bashing in his car windows with a baseball bat and slashing one of his tires.)\n\nSo, I had to be careful about name-dropping where I worked. The Source was a very popular (and powerful) entity and it had international name-recognition. I understood once and for all what it meant after a certain experience in Chicago\u2026\n\nIt's 2000.\n\nI'm in Chicago interviewing a rapper who shall remain nameless. (I asked if I could name-check him. He said no.) He has asked that we call him 'Q.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo Q took me to George's Music Room, a legendary record store run by music industry veteran George Daniels.\n\nI met George, interviewed him for a bit. Then, Q said he needed to talk privately with George. I wandered away, looked through the vinyl stacks and then went outside for a smoke break.\n\nI'm out there chopping it up with the photographer and I see this kid, no more than 15 or so, walk back and forth in front of me a few times. Walk past me, size me up. Walk past me again, size me up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm from East Orange, New Jersey. I know when I'm about to get got. So I tensed up, ready to haul ass if necessary.\n\nFinally, the kid decides to walk up on us.\n\nKid: \"Whatchu doing out here?\"\n\nMe: \"Working.\"\n\nKid: \"Working do what?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm a writer for The Source. I\u2019m interviewing Q for a story.\"\n\nKid's whole face and demeanor changes.\n\nKid: You work for The REAL Source magazine. In New York City?\"\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nKid: Can you put me in the magazine?\n\nI could have kicked myself. If there\u2019s any time I should not have said where I worked, it was to this kid. I\u2019d been in this position before, telling someone I worked at The Source and their next question would always be: How can I get in The Source. And secretly my answer would be, sell a million albums. That\u2019s a start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo now I\u2019m in sticky situation. I want to tell this kid: That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. But I had to be careful. Because sometimes people would get a bit\u2026 worked up if you said no, you can't be in the magazine.\n\nI looked the kid over. He definitely seemed like the type to get a bit\u2026worked up if I said no. I look over at my photographer and give her the non-verbal signal we had established that meant: just play along.\n\nMe: Aiight, Kid. Let's take your picture and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\n\nThe kid is beaming. He strikes a million poses. When we're done, he hounds me on what issue it will be in and where he'll be able to find it. I gave vague answers that were just short of outright lying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I'm still chatting with the kid who is bouncing around with excitement while the photographer packs up her equipment. And then 'Q' comes hauling ass out of the record store and over to where we're standing. He turned to the kid with a stern look on his face.\n\nQ: Kid, what are you doing here?\n\nKid: Yo, Q! I'ma be in The Source! Just like you!\n\nQ: Is that why you came over here Kid? To get in the magazine?\n\nKid hangs his head.\n\nKid: No.\n\nQ: Why'd you really come over here?\n\nKid lifts up his shirt. There's a nice shiny revolver tucked into his waistband. My stomach dropped and I felt a large lump in my throat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ: I told y'all to stay from around here with that bullshit! Get outta here Kid!\n\nKid shuffles away and then turns back around and points to me.\n\nKid: I'm still gonna be in The Source tho right?! Right?!\n\nMe: You better believe it!\n\nI go back to New York, wrote my story on Q. And made SURE to find a way to slip Kid's picture in that magazine. I can't remember how I managed to find him a place in the magazine or what the tiny little story was about. But Kid was in The Source. And Q made sure he got a copy of it.

Since that time, Trump has openly antagonized, insulted and bullied Sessions, both in conversation and on social media.\n\nSources have told the Washington Post that special counsel Robert Mueller has taken a keen interest in Trump\u2019s belittling of Sessions. Specifically, Mueller wants to know if Trump has been attempting to drive Sessions from his job and whether that is part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller\u2019s team has reportedly questioned witnesses in recent months about Trump\u2019s comments and state of mind when he wrote negative tweets about Sessions in July and August of last year.\n\nWas Trump trying to push Sessions out so he could appoint someone else who could control the Russia investigation? That is what the Mueller team seeks to find out, according to the Post.\n\nTrump once again attacked Sessions on Twitter Wednesday when he wrote, \u201cWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse.

This messaging effort is separate from other potential government actions like cyberattacks. Mr. Tillerson spent seven months trying to decide whether to spend any of the money. The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money. With another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, nothing has been done, and all of this comes on the heels of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s warning that Russia was already looking to interfere in the 2018 midterms.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s their intention to interfere, they\u2019re going to find ways to do that,\u201d Tillerson told Fox News last month. \u201cAnd we can take steps we can take, but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it, it\u2019s very difficult to pre-empt it.\u201d\n\nOh, Mr. Tillerson, I have an idea of how we can attempt to pre-empt Russian interference.

Averaging around 600,000 views per post, her funny and frank videos, like \u201cBougie and Bad on a Budget\u201d and \u201cEdges Slaughtered,\u201d bring the real on the makeup tip, touching on issues of race and money in ways that make viewers laugh as much as they learn.\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Aina a few days after she made history as the first social media star to receive the coveted NAACP Image Award. She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u201cdon\u2019t look good on you\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u201d I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u201cshe doesn\u2019t work very hard because she doesn\u2019t have to\u201d; [it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Aina is no stranger to hard work. She said that \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it,\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, who want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman, so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she said. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say, \u2018You\u2019re too pretty; how could you be in the Army? Whatever that means.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Aina seemed to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable: \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s OK to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounted in her voice as she said that she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative; we are multifaceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable; people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She pointed to prejudices surrounding beauty, like the now defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive or unattractive she really is. Aina said:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Aina has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but also defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Aina also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d she explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\nI\u2019m not ... just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough. I never know where I kind of fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle that most blacks in this country feel on some level every day: that our black cards could be revoked by anyone for not achieving the impossible task of representing the entire black experience as just one person. Aina said:\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve brought a lot of attention to on my YouTube channel, if you are racially ambiguous\u2014like you skew Asian\u2014it can be a lot easier. When people see more than black, they see mass-market appeal, [and] are more willing to give you a chance. People look at me, and they only see black. It means that people think my content isn\u2019t enjoyable to people who don\u2019t have the same color skin as I do. When it comes to buying foundation and cultural experiences, we want someone who we can relate to ... but I bet that people who won\u2019t give people who look like me a chance on YouTube have pretty homogeneous social and professional circles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAina urges us \u201cto switch it up and be supportive of other people of color in our industry\u2014[they] can be Latin or Indian, and I enjoy their content.\u201d To this end, she actively seeks out other vloggers who are the polar opposite, not only of her skin color and skin type\u2014Aina has oily skin and can advise women of all skin types\u2014but also to learn what\u2019s on the market and to get further inspiration about what makes women feel beautiful.\n\nIn February 2018, Aina received an NAACP Image Award, the first social media star to hold the honor. She told us: \u201cYou know, I never thought that social change could come about through makeup. All I want to do is enrich the lives of other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an acknowledgment that this makeup artist\u2014whose collaborations include becoming a Global United Nations change ambassador in partnership with YouTube, and a line of makeup highlighters with Artists Couture Cosmetics\u2014counts as \u201cthe most important thing that\u2019s happened to me and honors all the creators out there that are often overlooked.\u201d\n\nIn her role as a U.N. change ambassador, Aina\u2019s mission is twofold: to close the gender pay gap and to reach out to people and make them feel seen \u201cso that the way they see themselves changes the world sees them.\u201d\n\nJackie Aina, we definitely see you.", "keywords": ["women", "skin", "aina", "social", "way", "style", "black", "makeup", "lot", "warrior", "youtube", "look", "jackie"], "polarity": 0.13574263038548753, "subjectivity": 0.4877267573696145},

It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News.

At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated.

No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite.

The risks you took to get to where you wanted to be are really inspiring. Question: Are there career decisions you made where you still wonder if you made the right move?\n\n\u2013Kim, from Somewhere\n\nDear Kim: I\u2019ve had more than just one moment where I had to make a move and wasn\u2019t sure if it was the right one. I mean, I was the Entertainment Editor at EBONY up until just a few months ago when I returned to freelance writing full time. And while I\u2019m loving it so far, every time a freelance check is late, I wonder if I made the right decision. But! In my early days, I found myself in a very prickly spot. Sit back and let me tell you all about it\u2026\n\nLast week, I talked about how I weaseled my way into a job at The Source. What I didn\u2019t mention is what happened directly after my interview with the editor-in-chief. So what happened? Nothing. Weeks went by and he hadn\u2019t made a decision. Which led to me finding myself in an awkward professional situation.\n\nI started my journalism career in 1998, when I was hired as an editorial assistant at Billboard Magazine. I was geeked and excited. Billboard back then was very old school. It was run like a newspaper. And it was hard as hell to get a clip in there. My job was to answer the phones, file, distribute mail and write the table of contents each week. But I was antsy. I wanted to write.\n\nOne day, after I had been there about nine months, I approached the Managing Editor and told her I wanted to try to do more writing for the magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaybe in another year or so,\u201d she said with a smile.\n\nA year? Or SO?\n\nUm. No.\n\nI started looking for another job immediately.\n\n[Sidebar: \u2018Nuff respect to my boss. She wanted me to take my time and learn all the tricks of the trade. And she did start to assign me small stories. But I had big dreams.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I was freelancing for every magazine that would have me. I wrote pieces (for free) at Stress, a legendary hip-hop magazine. I wrote music reviews for XXL, short news stories for The Source and Honey. I was hustling. Hard.\n\nMy dream job was to work at The Source.\n\nIn 1998, it was the epicenter of hip-hop culture. The editor-in-chief was a man named Selwyn Seyfu Hinds, a Princeton grad with a penchant for pink oxfords and well-tailored suits. I\u2019d met him a few times and he was always encouraging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we all know, I wrangled a meeting with Selwyn by lying stretching the truth about a story I had been assigned and then getting caught red-handed.\n\nAfter the interview, Selwyn said he would call me soon with an answer. I left his office and floated back up to my cubicle at Billboard. I was going to work at The Source! Maybe. Yay!\n\nA week went by. And then another. And then another. And I didn\u2019t hear from Selwyn. I called his assistant each week. And the answer was always the same. He\u2019ll get back to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a month, it seemed like it just wasn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nAnd then, one morning at Billboard, I got a phone call.\n\n\u201cAliya, this is ABC, from Blaze magazine.\u201d\n\nI remember turning my head to the right and signaling wildly to Dylan, my cubicle mate. She watched me intently as I spoke on the phone, my hands shaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlaze was the new hip-hop magazine that the folks from VIBE had recently launched.\n\nThey were coming straight for The Source. The magazine had been out for a few months and had gone through a lot of turmoil, including a change in the editorial lineup.\n\nNow the managing editor was asking me to come in for an interview.\n\nI was shocked. I didn\u2019t even think those people knew who I was. I\u2019d done a few music reviews for Vibe and I considered Danyel Smith, the editor-in-chief of Vibe, to be a mentor. But still. They were thinking about little old me?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went for the interview. The Managing Editor gave me a tour of the offices and explained to me the position they were looking for\u2014Associate Editor\u2014and what my responsibilities would be. There wasn\u2019t a lot of writing involved. More editing. But still! A job! At Blaze?\n\nSign.\n\nMe.\n\nUp.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, I met briefly with Mimi Vald\u00e9s, the editor-in-chief of Blaze. I\u2019d been reading Mimi\u2019s byline for ages and ages. (I\u2019d even watched her jump the masthead from Vibe to The Source when I was still in college. And then, a few issues later, her name was back on the masthead at Vibe. In my magazine notebook, I carefully noted: \u201cMimi back at Vibe.\u201d The same way I did when I noticed Akiba Solomon\u2019s byline had jumped from Jane to The Source.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMimi showed me the new issue of the magazine, fresh from the printer. On the cover was a young Lil Wayne with his infant daughter in his arms. (It\u2019s hard to imagine now. But putting Lil Wayne on the cover was a very risky in-your-face move in 2000. He wasn\u2019t nearly as big as he is now. )\n\nI went back to Billboard, not sure if I would actually get the job at Blaze. I\u2019d really wanted to be at The Source but since I still hadn\u2019t heard anything, I was over the moon that I had another awesome option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next day, I put in a final call into Selwyn. I told his assistant to let him know that if I didn\u2019t hear from him, I would be taking a job at Blaze, if it were offered to me. I didn\u2019t hear back from Selwyn.\n\nOne Friday afternoon, I got a call from the Managing Editor at Blaze. I was officially offered the job as Associate Editor. I remember clapping my hands together and looking up at the ceiling at Billboard to keep tears from dropping down my face. One year. It had been one year since I stepped out on faith and left teaching. I fought way into an entry-level job at Billboard. And now I was moving on to one of the hottest hip-hop magazines on the stands. Fuck. Yeah.\n\nI accepted the job and the next day I went down to sit in on a staff meeting, get a tour of the offices and talk about salary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was making $18,000 at Billboard. That\u2019s not a typo. That\u2019s exactly what I was making. I had left my teaching gig the year before, where I was making about 35,000. And now I was making half that at Billboard. I\u2019m still proud of that young girl who took a risk and didn\u2019t think about the money.\n\nI digress.\n\nBlaze offered me $34,000. I didn\u2019t even think about counter offing or negotiating. I could actually pay my student loans each month instead of deferring them! I could eat! And not just Ramen noodles! I could even maybe get an apartment! (After my two roommates left me stranded in a three bedroom apartment in Ft. Green when they moved in with their boyfriends, I moved all my belongings under my desk at Billboard, (and hid some in some never-used cabinets). I had been sofa crashing, (or sleeping on the floor under my desk), for several weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlas. The day after I accepted the job at Blaze, I got a call from Selwyn. You might remember what he said from the last installment:\n\n\u201cAliya, you are a very talented writer. And besides that, you\u2019re hungry and tenacious. I looked over your story ideas and you are exactly what we need here at The Source. I\u2019m pleased to formally offer you a position as a staff writer with a salary of 33,000 per year. Welcome to The Source.\u201d\n\nI had tears rolling down my face. I was overjoyed that this man respected how hard I\u2019d worked in the past year to even get myself on his radar. But of course I was also crying because I was stuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAliya?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you accepting the position?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I call you back tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. Talk to you then.\u201d\n\nI remember (literally) rolling around on the floor of my cubicle at Billboard, while my girl Dylan tried to help me decide what to do. I had heart palpitations. My stomach was full of butterflies. I think I even threw up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stress to you how crazy this was. TWO OF THE TOP HIP-HOP MAGAZINES IN THE COUNTRY HAD BOTH OFFERED ME JOBS?!\n\nNow. I have to say, The Source had been around since 1988. It was firmly entrenched at number one. And under Selwyn, the magazine was filling its masthead with respected writers from around the country. It would be an honor to sweep the floors at that place.\n\nAnd Blaze was nothing to sneeze at either. They were the young, scrappy upstarts. They took risks with their covers. And it skewed younger and hipper. I could see myself getting a chance to really shine there. Selwyn was like a king at The Source. I\u2019d heard it was hard for junior staffers to get an audience with him. Mimi seemed more accessible. And I felt like she would really let me shine as a writer if I showed her what I was capable of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDylan,\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Dylan said, shaking her head.\n\n\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI would stay with Blaze,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cYou officially accepted! If you turn around and go to their main competitor? That\u2019s a bridge you\u2019ve burned forever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Aliya,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do you want to be? Without filtering yourself, right now, where do you want to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be at The Source.\u201d\n\nDylan threw up her hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never forgive yourself if you don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, I called the Managing Editor at Blaze.\n\nAs I write this, I\u2019m sixteen years removed from that phone call. And right now, my heart is thumping. And my stomach is churning. It\u2019s hard for me to even revisit that morning without feeling all that anxiety come rushing back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe managing editor answered the phone on the first ring.\n\n\u201cBlaze magazine\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Aliya King. I\u2019m sorry but I have some not-so-good news that I need to\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even tell me Aliya. Do not even tell me that you\u2019re going to The Source.\u201d\n\nI was shocked.\n\n\u201cUm. Well\u2026 Yes, I am\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what? That\u2019s real WHACK,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cIt\u2019s unprofessional. And it\u2019s unacceptable. We just sent you an official letter, outlining your position. You accepted the job. This is totally ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat at my desk at Billboard, tears streaming down my face and nodding my head.\n\n\u201cI totally understand. You have every right to be upset,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou guys are playing games over there and it\u2019s not right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first one to pull this shit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPull what? I wasn\u2019t trying to pull\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right. You get an offer over there. And then you come over here and we top it and then you run back over there for more money.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo no no,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened at all. I never\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever. Thanks for calling. Anything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to reach out to Mimi and tell her\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cMimi does not want to talk to you. Trust me. I\u2019ll tell her myself.\u201d\n\nAnd he hung up.\n\nI felt like I\u2019d gone a round or two with Mike Tyson.\n\nThe last part of what the managing editor said had confused me. I had no idea that other people at The Source had been dipping over to Blaze and pretending they were interested in working there. And then they would get a firm offer and go back to The Source and demand a raise while threatening to jump ship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had not done that at all. But it didn\u2019t matter. Accepting a job and then not taking it is just wrong on every level. And when you un-accept the job because you\u2019re going to the competition? That\u2019s far worse. And I would have to wear that. Forever.\n\nAs soon as I hung up the phone, I picked it back up again.\n\nEven though dude told me not to bother calling Mimi, I did anyway.\n\nI was shook. But something in my mind told me to suck it up and tell her what I was doing. I needed to woman-up and face it. I knew she\u2019d be pissed. But I wanted to face it head-on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer assistant put me through.\n\n\u201cHey Aliya,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget her voice. It was clipped. But still pleasant.\n\nI took a deep breath. If I wasn\u2019t careful, I was going to burst into tears while talking to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wanted to tell you myself,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is very unprofessional. But I am taking a job at The Source that I interviewed for a while back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Mimi said. \u201cI appreciate you calling me and telling me yourself. Take care.\u201d\n\nShe hung up quickly.\n\nAnd it was over.\n\nI started at The Source a month later.", "keywords": ["aliya", "source", "worked", "right", "job", "editor", "selwyn", "id", "blaze", "hiphop", "billboard", "im", "s", "magazine", "true", "kings"], "polarity": 0.06060387904137901, "subjectivity": 0.41708121270621273},

Most remember her as Janet Hubert\u2019s replacement in the role of Vivian Banks on the hit TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. But Maxwell-Reid had groundbreaking firsts as a black woman: the 1969 cover of Glamour magazine, and homecoming queen at the prestigious Northwestern University in Chicago.\n\n\n\nOn behalf of The Glow Up, stylist and entertainment reporter Marcellas Reynolds had the pleasure of talking with Maxwell-Reid about her incredible firsts\u2014decades before she became the second \u201cAunt Viv.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up: Daphne, how did you get discovered?\n\nDaphne Maxwell-Reid: My English teacher suggested me for Seventeen magazine my freshman year at Northwestern. That led to meeting Eileen Ford, the legendary owner of Ford Models. At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award. The current university president apologized, asked me to crown the new homecoming queen and to join the advisory board.\n\nDaphne Maxwell is crowned homecoming queen of Northwestern University in 1967.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite. I thought, \u201cHoly cow! I\u2019m in a great bunch!\u201d It was a Ladies Home Journal article: \u201cFourteen Most Beautiful Women in the World.\u201d I was chosen as one of them. I was floored! It was 1968 or 1969, when Ladies Home Journal was a big magazine. Supermodel Cheryl Tiegs was in that picture.\n\n\n\nTGU: The path from model to actress seems to have been easy for you.\n\n\n\nDMR: I was a curious, adventurous woman. I had no qualms about walking through another door. My career and life have been luck, guided by a higher power.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What is the biggest life lesson modeling taught you?\n\n\n\nDMR: Modeling taught me about self-love, and to separate work from real life. If you don\u2019t get a job or a booking, it is not about you, so don\u2019t be unhappy, because that was not your job.\n\n\n\nTGU: How have you seen things change in entertainment and fashion?\n\n\n\nDMR: I have seen that it has become more acceptable to be the person that you are. I have seen the dominant culture open their eyes\u2014or have their eyes opened to\u2014the possibility that there is something else out there they were not aware of, and that was us [black people]. The acceptance of that I have seen go through many changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I first started on television, I was one of a few black women who was doing network television.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["lives", "korryn", "baltimore", "mothers", "right", "wont", "speaks", "theres", "hes", "family", "rest", "situation", "child", "mother", "pain", "gaines", "dormeus"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

You asked, and I got the answers on the best chemical peels and lasers for darker skin tones.\n\n\n\nDuring last week\u2019s \u201csnow bomb cyclone,\u201d I checked in with Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained New York City dermatologist, to talk about the latest offerings in her practice. As a black woman herself, she had plenty of advice to offer The Glow Up about using lasers and peels on melanin-rich skin.\n\n\u201cFor the darkest skin types, I like the Clear and Brilliant laser for resurfacing. I will also use the Fraxel laser with lower settings,\u201d Henry says.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used both of these treatments, and they do remove every line and every speck of discoloration on the skin. The doctor warns that the effects aren\u2019t permanent, though. \u201cA newer laser that is safe for all skin types is the Infini laser. It combines microneedling and radio frequency, so it tightens and corrects textural issues,\u201d she says.\n\nThis new generation of lasers allows the physician to tailor the treatment specifically to each issue on a patient\u2019s face, whereas previous generations of lasers obliged the doctor to treat the face with multiple processes. Including microneedling is part of that tailoring, using microscopic needles to puncture the skin, causing controlled wounding that stimulates the natural healing process and the production of collagen, which restores both radiance and elasticity to the surface of the skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor specific tightening and toning, Henry says, \u201cI love using the Aerolase 1064 Laser for skin rejuvenation and laser toning in darker skin types.\u201d\n\nDesigned to deal with thicker areas of the skin, this laser is helpful for acne scars, stretch marks, spider veins, keloid revision and fungal issues with nails, among other things. Scars can thankfully now be permanently removed, commonly in about two to four treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the best peels for African-American skin? \u201cMy go-to peels are the Vitalize Peel and VI Peel. Both are very effective but safe for all skin types,\u201d says Henry. \u201cThe VI Peel is a deeper peel, so I use it for hyperpigmentation and textural issues.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve personally used peels, and they\u2019re generally quick and painless\u2014with the exception of a few minutes of stinging or tingling, depending on your level of pain tolerance. During treatment, a small handheld fan is often offered to reduce the temporary stinging sensation. Peels takes about 45 minutes in total, and the downtime is 24 hours without makeup. I\u2019ve yet to try either of Henry\u2019s favorite peels, but I\u2019m about due for one. Once I do, I\u2019ll let you know what the doctor orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, living life brings the fine lines back over time; the better you treat yourself with diet, hydration and exercise, the longer the smoothing effect lasts.\n\nTry to avoid factors like alcohol, junk food and sleep deprivation in order to preserve your investment in any treatment. Sun exposure and hormonal changes can trigger the return of discoloration on the skin. And no matter our skin tone, we should all use products with sun protection factor because cancer\u2014including melanoma\u2014doesn\u2019t discriminate. If you live right, you can get up to two years of lasting effects from these treatments.", "keywords": ["surgery", "regular", "henry", "using", "live", "lasers", "skin", "types", "peel", "plastic", "redcarpet", "life", "facetune", "peels", "laserandpeel", "laser", "treatment", "doctor"], "polarity": 0.21186278368096553, "subjectivity": 0.43090318772136954},

I froze when I read the masthead of The Source. Marcus Reeves, who had graduated a few years before me at Rutgers University, was now the News Editor. I can\u2019t even begin to explain what a big deal this was. There was a person who had infiltrated The Source who actually knew my name! Someone I could actually call and say hello to!\n\nAs much as I\u2019d wanted to, I hadn\u2019t majored in journalism in college. There was that refrain I kept hearing from friends and family: writers don\u2019t make money.

Finally, after two years of teaching, I jumped ship to see if I could make it as a writer.

Since Billboard was a weekly, we got information really fast and our fax machines, (yes, fax machines), were consistently spitting out press releases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne day I got a package in the mail. It was a black and white headscarf with the logo of a new record label called Ruff Ryders. Seemed interesting. I read up on it. Talked to the PR folks. Seemed like a good news story. Time to call Marcus!\n\nMe: I have a story for you.\n\nMarcus: What\u2019s up.\n\nMe: There\u2019s a new label coming out. They\u2019re called the Ruff Ryders.

You have to try a little harder to get me something I don\u2019t already know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**click**\n\nThis continued for several months. I would find something I thought seemed newsworthy, do some quick research and hit up Marcus. He would either yawn, admonish me for pitching something the magazine had already covered or just flat out say no.\n\nAnd then. I got a press release about Wyclef\u2019s annual benefit for Haiti in Miami. Lots of great acts lined up, (including a new group I liked called Destiny\u2019s Child). How could Marcus not cover this?

Just 500 words on the concert and interview as many celebs as you can.\n\nMe: YES SIR!\n\nMarcus: Actually, you know what? I don\u2019t have a lot of room in that issue.

Ouch.) I had three roommates in a very tiny apartment in Fort Greene. I called my friend D. His sister worked for an airline. I begged him to get me a buddy pass to Miami. He said he would try. A week later, Marcus calls me back.\n\nMarcus: Hey. Gotta kill that story.\n\nMe: Why?\n\nMarcus: Don\u2019t want to use random photos. And we\u2019re not sending a photographer down there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe: Didn\u2019t I tell you I was going down there with my best friend D who is a well-known photographer published in grumble-grumble and mumble-mumble?\n\nMarcus: Wait. Did you tell me that?\n\nMe: I thought for sure I did.\n\nMarcus: Can he get a couple of exclusive shots for us?\n\nMe: Of course!\n\nMarcus: Great. Story\u2019s back on.\n\nI call D. back and let him know I need him to get two buddy passes. Because although he was in law school and preparing for the bar, he was going to have to take a break from studying and pretend to be a well-known photographer so I could get this story. D almost had a heart-attack. But he got the buddy passes. The day before we\u2019re set to leave, I call D and double check to make sure he has everything he needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cJust need a camera.\u201d\n\n[insert screams here]\n\nTwenty minutes later, I\u2019m in a camera shop in midtown Manhattan and some dude is trying to show me how to use a zoom lens. My experience with cameras stopped at Polaroids. I used my grocery money AND my rent money to rent the biggest, fanciest camera I could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamera shop dude: \u201cAre you sure your photographer knows how to use this camera?\n\nMe: Of course he does.\n\nI gave the huge camera case and lenses to D when we got to the airport and if looks could kill, I wouldn\u2019t be here telling you this story. We flew on standby. And for three consecutive flights to Miami, we ain\u2019t do nothing but stand by and watch people board. Finally, we made it onto a flight and got to Miami. We spent the flight trying to figure out how to use the camera. Who knew they didn\u2019t give you film when you rented a camera!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the venue, I met up with Lesley Pitts, the publicist for the event. Bless this woman\u2019s soul because she knew I was full of crap, (and my bootleg photographer too), but she still gave me the mega-extra-all-access pass so I could roll up to whoever and get my interview.\n\n\u201cInterview anyone you can get,\u201d Lesley said. \u201cBut not Wyclef. He has a full day of interviews with large outlets.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nI hit that backstage area like a ninja assassin. Is that Destiny\u2019s Child over there? Oh yeah. I stuck my recorder in the lead singer\u2019s face. She was super prim and proper as she talked about the importance of giving back to the community and supporting Wyclef\u2019s charity event. And then she made sure to slip in that their new single was called Bills Bills Bills and they would be performing it later on. (They got booed.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor an hour, I ran up on every celeb I could find, with D trailing behind me, trying to keep up and not look insane with this ridiculous camera that he didn\u2019t know how to work. At one point, a publicist snatched him up and told him to go into the area with the other photographers. I just saw his mouth open; calling my name, while a sea of real photographers who were snapping the show swallowed him up. Sorry dude. Gotta get these interviews.\n\nFinally, I see Wyclef. And I\u2019m thinking, this is big. He\u2019s the orchestrator of the entire event. But Lesley said don\u2019t talk to him. But. He\u2019s just standing there chilling with some random people. What\u2019s the harm? Marcus would be really impressed if I came back with quotes from Clef. I eased over to where Wyclef stood, talking to another guy. I interrupted.\n\nMe: Excuse me, Clef? Can I ask you a few questions for The Source?\n\nClef: You\u2019re from The Source?\n\nMe: Yes, I am. Name\u2019s Aliya S. King. Nice to meet you.\n\nClef: I didn\u2019t know The Source was sending anyone down.\n\nMe: Well they did sir. Can I ask a few questions?\n\nClef: What kind of story is this?\n\nMe: A big one. Very important.\n\nClef: Ha. Is it a cover story?\n\nMe: I have no idea. I don\u2019t make those decisions.\n\nClef: Okay. What are your questions?\n\nI ask my questions. Go way overboard. Skip from charity concert to the current political climate in Port Au Prince. After a few minutes, Clef politely ended the interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I turn to walk away, the man he had been talking to taps me on the shoulder.\n\nMan: Did you say you were from The Source?\n\n(I\u2019m thinking, wow! My first story for The Source and already folks are sweating me. Just saying the name rings bells baby. Mama I made it!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe: Yes. I\u2019m from The Source. Can I help you?\n\nMan: Which editor are you writing for?\n\nMe: His name is Marcus Reeves. He\u2019s the News Editor. [so take THAT I say to myself]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMan: Yes, I know Marcus. What kind of story is this you\u2019re working on?\n\nMe: It\u2019s a story on the concert and on Clef. It\u2019s multi-faceted.\n\nMan: Right. I could tell from the questions you were asking him that it definitely wasn\u2019t just a short news item about this concert. Dude stuck out his hand and smiled at me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMan: My name is Selwyn Seyfu Hinds. I\u2019m the editor-in-chief of The Source.\n\nMe:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nSelwyn: Did Marcus pay for you to fly down here?\n\nMe: No sir.\n\nHim: Did he send a photographer down here?\n\nMe. No sir.\n\nHim: So how are you getting photos for this?\n\nMe. I brought a friend who is a photographer.\n\nHim: Where is he?\n\nI point. D is trying to reload the camera. Another photographer who looks hella frustrated is trying to help him. D looks insanely inept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelwyn: So you two flew down here on your own?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nSelwyn. How long is the story?\n\nMe. 250 words.\n\nSelwyn: Right. So definitely not a cover story.\n\nI turn crimson at this point. Wyclef is nearby. Chuckling.\n\nMe: No. Definitely not a cover story.\n\nSelwyn shakes his head from side to side. Then he pulls a business card out and puts it in my hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelwyn: As soon as you get back to New York, call my assistant and set up a meeting. If there\u2019s a reporter out there flying herself to Miami on her own dime and running up on celebrities like this, I think I need to sit down with her.\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak. So I just nodded. I called Selwyn\u2019s office FROM A PAYPHONE AT NEWARK AIRPORT precisely five minutes after we landed. I made an appointment and pulled a week of all-nighters putting together an issue plan and a series of story ideas, section ideas and column ideas that would work for the magazine and outlining in detail why he needed to hire me as a staff writer, a position that did not exist. I knew I belonged there. I had been grateful to get my foot in the board with the 18K job at Billboard. But it was time to move up\u2014and maybe make enough money to actually eat. This was my shot. And I wasn\u2019t about to blow it.\n\nI met with Selwyn. I carefully laid out all my paperwork on the coffee table in his office. I spread out the last six issues, marked up with Post-It notes with my thoughts and suggestions. I handed him my packets and explained my proposal. He smiled and nodded and said he\u2019d be in touch. He called weeks later. According to my journal, these were his exact words:\n\n\u201cAliya, you are a very talented writer. And besides that, you\u2019re hungry and tenacious. I looked over your story ideas and you are exactly what we need here at The Source.

A benefit that we\u2014those of us who didn\u2019t vote for Trump\u2014have is that because he wears his emotions, as well as his presidential number, on his sleeve\u2014we see you, 45!\n\nPhoto: Chip Somodevilla (Getty Images)\n\nOn Tuesday the president finished up his morning ritual of burning Barack Obama photos and slathering pig blood across his stomach before tweeting quotes from Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s favorite news network:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe ended his tweet storm with an obnoxious all-caps tweet like only this president can:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does all of this prove? That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up. So far, Mueller\u2019s investigation has led to charges against Trump\u2019s campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, his aide Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign George Papadopoulos and Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn. All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps? Could it have something to do with Trump\u2019s fake daughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, White House Communications Director Hope Hicks is set to met with members of the House Intelligence Committee, CNN reports. In a closed-door interview, Hicks will be grilled as part of a separate investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 election. Yes, there are multiple investigations into possible Russia collusion because, well, Russia colluded.\n\nHicks served as a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 before moving into her new role. Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him. You can always tell, whenever someone goes all caps, that they\u2019ve been triggered, and clearly this happened to Trump this morning. I assume that he tweeted this right before his morning ritual of sacrificing a baby goat and poking pins in his stuffed Obama doll.\n\n#StayWoke.", "keywords": ["morning", "election", "latest", "trump", "trumps", "russian", "president", "heating", "pleaded", "guilty", "investigation", "proves", "russia"], "polarity": -0.010199283475145537, "subjectivity": 0.47683982683982684},

This poses a problem when senior-level staff with full clearance have to be careful about what information they share with those who have only interim clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of November, more than 130 White House staffers were working without full security clearance.\n\nLast month we also learned that both Porter and White House speechwriter David Sorensen had histories of domestic abuse. This is something that, at least in the case of Porter, could have prevented him from gaining full, permanent clearance.\n\nThe president is presumably allowing people to work with interim clearance, and as of now, we don\u2019t know which of those staffers have since gained full clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Rogers, a former Republican representative who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN last month: \u201cThe security clearance process is critical to keeping America\u2019s secrets. Foreign intelligence services look for vulnerabilities in individuals with access to our most sensitive information. Not following the process is a disservice not only to the individual but to our countries security interests. It\u2019s unusual that so many have taken so long.\u201d\n\nOf course, the White House is tight-lipped about both the security-clearance process and which members of the White House staff and administration do not have full clearance.\n\nStill, we have to question the implications for our national security when even the president himself would not have security clearance if it didn\u2019t automatically come with the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also would not pass a full background check. There are things in his past that would render him ineligible for full security clearance. And yet, there he sits in the Oval Office\u2014with access to our military secrets and the power to launch us into nuclear war.\n\nAs we wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to figure out whether or not Trump obstructed justice and whether or not he was a pawn for the Russians, we need to be worried about who else the president has been running his mouth to. We\u2019ve seen from his frequent outbursts on Twitter that he lacks self-control and decorum.\n\nThe sloppiness with which this security-clearance issue has been handled is deplorable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was given access to top-secret information while working with interim status.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman was also working there without security clearance.

She also claimed that while Daniels was in the hospital, his body was guarded by \u201cfour or five\u201d police officers and his family wasn\u2019t allowed to see him.\n\nThe case is currently being investigated, as is the case with all fatal police-involved shootings.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this from the Post-Gazette:\n\nThe Pittsburgh police officer who fatally shot a man during an exchange of gunfire in Homewood on Feb. 11 has been involved in two other shootings in the past 10 months. Officer Gino A. Macioce, a five-year veteran and field training officer, shot 39-year-old Mark Daniels, a spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto confirmed Tuesday. It\u2019s at least the third time in recent months Officer Macioce has opened fire while on the job in Zone 5. He was involved in non-fatal shootings in January and April, court records show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2017, Macioce shot 20-year-old Christopher Howard, who robbed two women in the area, was approached and chased by Macioce and allegedly pulled out a sawed-off shotgun. Macioce shot Howard, forcing him to drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in January 2018, Macioce was involved in the shooting of 26-year-old Eric Farrar, who allegedly was carrying a shotgun, dropped it when the officers ordered him to and then reached into his waistband for a pistol to fire at them. Macioce and a second officer on the scene shot and critically wounded him.\n\nNow, is it possible that each of these shootings was justified and that Macioce just happened to be the officer on the scene each time? Yes, that is possible. Is it also possible that Macioce happened to have three criminals separately attempt to shoot him in less than a year\u2019s time? Yes, that is possible. Considering that many officers can go entire 30-year careers without anyone shooting at them, is it possible that Macioce is just unfathomably unlucky? Yes, that is possible.\n\nRegardless of the possibilities, it\u2019s definitely true that violence keeps finding Gino Macioce. Or perhaps violence doesn\u2019t have to look that hard because Macioce keeps looking for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd since it\u2019s true that each man Macioce shot was black, it\u2019s also possible that Gino Macioce just keeps finding reasons to shoot black people.", "keywords": ["shoots", "cop", "officer", "daniels", "officers", "possible", "yes", "black", "macioce", "shootings", "scene", "kills", "pittsburgh", "shot"], "polarity": 0.004166666666666665, "subjectivity": 0.53671875},

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda.

Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["know", "help", "wanted", "folks", "history", "killmonger", "black", "njobu", "cant", "panther", "revisionist", "riots", "tchalla"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

I couldn't write for VIBE or XXL of course. But I would quietly write about rock bands for Seventeen and Teen People occasionally.\n\n\n\nI ended up writing regularly for Teen People and I became a go-to writer for the Entertainment Editor there.\n\n\n\nA lot of my assignments were given last-minute, which is normal in the game and I was used to grabbing my recorder and hauling butt to some concert or interview that was happening in an hour\u2014or less.\n\n\n\nSo, the Apollo Theater was having a benefit concert of some sort and a lot of big names were scheduled to appear. Eve, Sisqo, Jay-Z and a bunch of other folks I can't remember.\n\n\n\nThe Entertainment Editor at Teen People called and asked me to go to the concert and get some evergreen quotes from the artists that they could use in upcoming issues. She didn't want me to cover the event. She just wanted me to ask questions like, \"What was the best present you ever got for Valentine's Day?\" so they could include it when their February issue rolled around.\n\n\n\nShe sent me the questions and they were all super basic and easy. (A little too basic. It was a real left turn from the questions I had to ask at The Source.)\n\n\n\nI got to the venue and went backstage. I told the folks there that I was with Teen People and they hustled me to the area allotted for me. There was an assembly line of media outlets. As the artists came off stage, they stopped at each station and did a brief interview.\n\n\n\nSisqo came off stage after singing \"The Thong Song.\" (I know, we want to forget. But we mustn't. It happened.)\n\n\n\nI held up my recorder and asked my corny questions.\n\n\n\n\"What was your most embarrassing moment?\"\n\n\"What do you wish you did more of when you were a teenager?\"\n\n\"Who was your first crush?\"\n\n\n\nHe answered. And then he moved down the line to the next interview.\n\n\n\nThen, this dude walks up to me. He's holding a bunch of wires and tech-y looking stuff.\n\n\n\n\"You're with Teen People?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why are you standing over here? We've been waiting for you!\"\n\n\n\nDude hustles me over to a corner, puts a microphone in my hand and then clips something to the back of my pants. I'm thoroughly confused. Then he spins me around and walks behind a huge camera.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, she's mic'd\" he says to a team of about four people.\n\n\n\nI'm looking at the mic in my hand. And then up at the camera in my face. It dawns on me. These are on-camera interviews. It turns out I was supposed to interview the celebrities on-camera for some special segment Teen People was doing on a news show AND get the evergreen quotes for the magazine.\n\n\n\nI did NOT get that memo.\n\n\n\nI had never held a real microphone in my hand in my life. I had never been on camera and had never interviewed anyone on camera.\n\n\n\nI started to have a panic attack. I didn't know how to do on-camera interviews! Where was I supposed to look? Was I just feeding the questions or was I actually going to be on camera too?\n\n\n\nThere was no time to ask questions. Jay-Z had just come off stage and was standing next to me.\n\n\n\nI remember thinking. Wow. He is really tall. And I am really scared because I don't know what the hell I'm doing.\n\n\n\nJay looked down at me. I looked up at Jay. Then I turned to the camera guy and waited for him to tell me to start.\n\n\n\nDude behind the camera yelled out: \"SPEED!\"\n\n\n\nI looked around, thinking maybe there was something wrong with the equipment and he needed something called speed to fix it.\n\n\n\nDude yells again: SPEED!\n\n\n\nI look at him and just blink.\n\n\n\nJay-Z elbows me. I look up at him.\n\n\n\n\"Speed means the camera's rolling,\u201d says Jay. \u201cYou can ask the questions now.\u201d\n\nMy stomach sunk.\n\n\n\n\"Right!\" I said, fumbling for my paper with the questions on it and trying to unfold it without dropping the microphone. My hands were shaking and I was sweating bullets.\n\n\n\n\"So Jay-Z,\" I said. \"Th-this is\u2026. is for um, for Teen People. The readers would like to know: \"What's been your most embarrassing moment?\"\n\n\n\nJay smiled.\n\n\n\n\"I can't think of one,\" he said. \"But I know YOUR most embarrassing moment.\"\n\n\n\nHe walked away laughing that official Jay-Z cackle and I was mortified.\n\n\n\nI somehow made it through the rest of the interviews but every time I got a glimpse of Jay-Z, he was still laughing at me.\n\n\n\nIf only the story ended there.\n\n\n\nA few weeks later, I was at a concert. I can't for the life of me remember who it was. But I remember it was the first time I saw Puffy in person. He was wearing a floor-length black mink coat and I was awestruck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight before the show started I heard someone yell out SPEED! I spun around.\n\nIt was Jay-Z, just a few feet away, in the cut with his friends, cackling and pointing at me.\n\n\n\nIf only the story ended there.\n\n\n\nA month later; another show. This one is packed shoulder-to-shoulder. There\u2019s a VIP section upstairs and the industry heavyweights are sitting at tables drinking Champagne. (Hmmmm. Late 90s. I\u2019m guessing it would be Cristal?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm standing on the floor with friends, checking out the crowd.\n\nFrom above, I hear someone yell out: SPEED!\n\n\n\nI look up. It's Jay, sitting in VIP, pointing at me and laughing. Again.\n\n\n\nI never interviewed Jay-Z again, unless you count that disastrous one-question interview in 1999. And I never saw him again after that last concert where he saw that little dreadlocked freckle-faced girl who didn't know what Speed meant and decided to tease her every time he saw her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I do often wonder, if I did interview him now would he remember and yell out SPEED and start laughing as soon as he saw me?\n\nHonestly?

Not President Donald Trump, though; he\u2019s out stunting, bashing the armed school security officer for not running into the school to save the kids, and of course, making everything about himself.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know until you test it, but I think, I really believe I\u2019d run in there, even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too,\u201d Trump told a gathering of U.S. governors at the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for a test; you don\u2019t even have to pull out a pen and paper\u2014Trump would fail, miserably. This is a president who is afraid of germs, afraid of bald eagles, afraid of being booed and afraid of being poisoned, and he used bone spurs as an excuse to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere is nothing that Donald Trump has ever done that would give anybody the impression he would risk his own life to run into a hail of bullets to protect a bunch of kids, maybe not even his own.\n\n\n\nNever fear, though; there are some decent presidents out there, and I can think of about 10 off the top of my head who would be more likely to\u2014and whom I\u2019d rather have\u2014risk life and limb to save a bunch of kids from a mass shooting than Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Andrew Jackson\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nAndrew Jackson, our seventh president, 20 Dollar Jack, survived 13 duels, lived with a bullet in his leg for 19 years and was known to beat folks down with a hickory stick just for fun. He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president. So he\u2019d definitely run into a school to save a bunch of kids for the glory, but only the white ones because racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The President From Rick and Morty\n\nThe president in Rick and Morty is a badass, he has an arsenal of weapons, he\u2019s vengeful and he fought the smartest man in the universe over a selfie. If he weren\u2019t black, I\u2019m pretty sure Trump would nominate him to run into a hail of bullets and save a bunch of kids in his place. And he\u2019s voiced by Keith David. Who isn\u2019t comforted by the sound of Keith David\u2019s voice in times of danger?\n\n5. Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4. Bill Clinton\n\nYes, Bill Clinton is a draft dodger just like Trump, and nothing about him strikes me as being particularly altruistic. But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background. Mind you, if he screwed up or got lost on the way to save the kids, the buffalo soldiers would show up and actually get the job done\u2014showing once again how black Americans are always there to clean up America\u2019s problems.\n\n", "keywords": ["afraid", "school", "presidents", "save", "hes", "run", "kids", "likely", "president", "shooter", "bunch", "trump"], "polarity": 0.0983643353174603, "subjectivity": 0.4928311011904762},

He called every news station that would listen to him and went on a full college-boy temper tantrum. Seriously, he spoke to the Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, Vox, Yahoo! and some local New York news channel called Spectrum News NY1. It was the latter interview in which he called White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee, a fat slob.\n\nFor the better half of the evening news cycle, Nunberg went full bizarro Oprah and gave everybody a car (if the car was a sad public rant about how he won\u2019t be doing anything required by the subpoena from special counselor Robert Mueller in the Trump Russia investigation).\n\nIf Nunberg weren\u2019t so damn full of himself, it would have been a public meltdown, and maybe it still was, but it wasn\u2019t a sympathetic plea from a beaten man\u2014this was a full-on Kanye-midshow stream of consciousness rant that Nunberg himself was in on.\n\n\u201cLike, how ballsy is this?\u201d Nunberg gloated during his interview with Yahoo!

Why do I have to go? Why? For what?\u201d This was Nunberg\u2019s position on a subpoena. May we all be this bold some day.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump may have very well done something during the election with the Russians.\u201d Yep, Nunberg just dropped this little jewel in the middle of his rant, because just like his idol Kanye, in between the nonsensical shit are bits of truth telling.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump caused this because he\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Nunberg said, referring to the Russia investigation, Business Insider reports. \u201cHe decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey, and then he decided to have Russians in the Oval Office. You\u2019ll have to explain to me because I\u2019ll never understand it.\u201d\n\n\n\nArguably the best line: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get sent to prison!\u201d Umm, I don\u2019t know how right you are about this one, Nunberg, but I like your moxie.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNunberg was so off the rails that CNN anchor Erin Burnett asked him if he\u2019d been drinking.\n\nBurnett asked him if he\u2019d had anything else, you know, besides alcohol.

I don\u2019t know if Nunberg is failing spectacularly or winning miserably, but either way I admire his white-boy elitism that allows him to thumb his nose at the special counsel.

So imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe has been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time she has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African Diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain.

I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years.

She\u2019s built a successful and evolving brand that started on the strength of one product: her best-selling \u201cLip Whip.\u201d Famed for smudge-free saturation in no fewer than 45 shades (and counting), the day-to-night finish is vegan, nontoxic and 100 percent cruelty-free ... and so tough to budge that it requires its own remover.\n\nAccording to Cashmere Nicole, it was a formula built out of necessity:\n\nI think Beauty Bakerie introduced a lifestyle change; a complete makeover or face-lift to how the makeup-application process works, and how we should approach that overall. Putting on makeup is exhausting\u2014I think we just need to be real. ... And then, you want to pile on the layer of being a parent, or the layers of the 9-to-5, or all of the other different obligations that we have as individuals ... And I think that was a big component to me: How do I make this easier for myself? How can I make it through my day without having to be completely flatlined by the makeup-application process?\n\nIt was an instinct that paid off. In six short years, the CEO has guided the brand from a solo venture to a staff of 30, and from lips to full-face glamour. Her Flour setting powders offer the same all-day dependability as her lip colors, and a line of concealers are on deck for 2018. Meanwhile, her eye shadow palettes fly off the shelves of both her online and San Diego Beauty Bakerie boutiques\u2014especially her \u201cCoffee & Cocoa\u201d palette, created for her teenage daughter and emblazoned with her personal and professional motto: \u201cBetter, not bitter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough successful, the past six years have been bittersweet for Cashmere Nicole. Soon after launching Beauty Bakerie in 2011 at the age of 27, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, a recurring prognosis that would eventually require a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. Now 33, she remains optimistic and forward-thinking:\n\nYou know, I often tell people that I\u2019m living in my afterlife, after just going through maybe 10 years of feeling as though a lot of things weren\u2019t working out the way that I would want them to; just setback after setback. So, I think in that process you become a bit conditioned to say, \u201cI\u2019ve got to expect the worst but hope for the best.\u201d And in hindsight, I don\u2019t particularly like that way of thinking. It worked for me at that time, but after going through a life-changing experience with cancer and looking back now, I would say that it\u2019s just better to focus on the things that are working for you\u2014the things that you know you can do for sure\u2014and do away with things that you can\u2019t change.\n\nAnd she\u2019s definitely changing the makeup game. In her own evolution from a teenage mother putting herself through nursing school to socking away every spare dollar to start Beauty Bakerie, and recently garnering a $3 million seed investment from Unilever Ventures, Cashmere Nicole is redefining what a beauty mogul looks like. And while she\u2019s a self-confessed \u201cserial entrepreneur from the age of 12,\u201d she admits that she\u2019s learning as she grows her business:\n\nI think I am pretty tough, just based on feedback from some of the people around me, but sometimes I even question that. So, I think you have to have a delicate balance of knowing when to be sugar and when to be shit, a little. And I think I\u2019m still learning how to balance both of them; and [that\u2019s] the tough part about being a CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith pending expansion into retailers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Beauty Bakerie\u2019s growing international presence on home-shopping giant QVC, and a daughter heading off to college soon, it looks like Nicole\u2019s balancing act is going to get quite a workout. But she\u2019s more than up to the challenge:\n\nYou know, walking out of a doctor\u2019s office and being told you have cancer; you can cry, but what do you do? Go dig a grave for yourself and lay in it? I mean, you have to keep going; and that applies to everything. ... My best advice for staying power is that when the whole world and all of your friends might tell you that the easiest thing is to turn around and go back, you should do the exact opposite. You should keep going forward, because in that walk and in that journey of staying, you do become powerful, and you become stronger. And you will fall, and you will hurt yourself, and you will cry. But as long as you get back up and keep going, that is where you\u2019ll be made.", "keywords": ["beauty", "indelible", "shes", "talks", "success", "cashmere", "think", "built", "makeup", "building", "nicole", "things", "going", "survival", "staying", "bakerie", "tough", "maven"], "polarity": 0.09642857142857143, "subjectivity": 0.46062925170068025},

(How I got on is a story of epic proportions for another day.)\n\nWhen I interviewed for the job with Selwyn Seyfu Hinds, the editor-in-chief, I came to him with a ton of ideas for stories and columns.\n\nOne of the ideas was for a monthly column following three brand new rappers who were navigating their first year in the music industry. I thought it would be awesome to revisit them every month as they signed their contracts, recorded their first album and began the journey to fame.\n\nI had big dreams for the column too. I\u2019d choose people in different regions and actually fly out to see them, (with a photographer!) every single month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI added the idea to my proposal for my interview with Selwyn but I knew there wasn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell it would ever actually happen.\n\nBut a few weeks after I started at The Source, Selwyn walked by my desk, on his way to the fire escape, (which we called the \u201cporch\u201d), to read some copy. On his way, he leaned over my cubicle and said, \u201cAliya. The story you pitched about following the new rappers? You should get moving on that.\u201d\n\nI was floored.\n\nI quickly called up all the publicists I knew and asked who was newly signed that would make sense for this column. My editors had decided I would choose one rapper from New York, one from the Midwest and one from the west coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knew immediately who I was going to choose from NYC: A young rapper named Lady Luck.\n\nA year before, when I was an editorial assistant at Billboard, I\u2019d been listening to Ed Lover\u2019s morning show where he had an on-air freestyle battle segment. This teenaged girl came on-air and ripped it. Legend has it that Ed Lover personally walked her over to Def Jam after she won several times and there was talk that she was signing to the label. She was sixteen years old.\n\nI did a brief interview with her for Billboard. She was boastful, witty, energetic, loud and all-around awesome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got approval from my editors to follow Luck for the year. She was starting her senior year of high school that September which gave the story layers that I thought would be amazing. A 17 year old girl starts senior year being signed to Def Jam?!\n\nAND you\u2019re on the radio in rapid rotation for a Pharoahe Monch song called \u201cSimon Says,\u201d featuring Method Man, Redman and Busta Rhymes?!\n\nTHAT is how you\u2019re starting senior year?\n\nMy editor told me I had to roll with her on the first day of school.\n\n\u201cCall Gaby at Def Jam,\u201d he said. \u201cTell them you want to come to her house in the morning and follow her all the way to school. Interview her on the way. And then interview whoever you can outside the school before she goes inside.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was on it. I called Gaby, Luck\u2019s publicist at Def Jam.\n\nShe said no.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Aliya,\u201d she said. \u201cI already have a writer from a different publication following her on the first day of school. You can definitely interview her the next day. She knows about the column and she remembers when you interviewed her at Billboard. She\u2019s excited. But we have to wait until the next day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t having it. I needed to be there on the first day. I needed to see how she walked through those double doors.\n\nNow, at this time, as far as hip-hop was concerned, there was The Source\u2014and then there was everybody else. So I tried to play hardball.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this column FOR THE WHOLE YEAR if I can\u2019t roll with her on the first day,\u201d I told Gaby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaby didn\u2019t budge. It wasn\u2019t happening.\n\n\u201cWhat magazine is it?\u201d I asked. If it was another rap magazine, I would have to find another rapper. There was NO way I was following behind any other mag with this story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s The New Yorker,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said.\n\nBack in the \u201890s, mainstream media love for hip-hop acts was hard to come by. I knew there was no way I could trump The New Yorker. Gaby knew every rap act would eventually cover Lady Luck. But getting coverage in The New Yorker, (not New York, but The New YorkER), was something special.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh well.\n\nI told one my editor the situation. He shrugged it off.\n\n\u201cDo you need to interview her that day?\u201d he said. \u201cOr do you just want to see her in action that day?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really just want to see her,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSo go see her,\u201d my editor said. Get to the school early on the first day. Wait around. She\u2019s bound to show up and make an entrance. Take some notes. Interview some of the other students. Then interview her the next day and when you write the column, add in what you saw on the first day.\u201d\n\nYes!\n\nI called Gaby back and told her my plan.\n\n\u201cNo, Aliya,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Just wait until the next day. I don\u2019t want the New Yorker reporter to think I booked two reporters. Just wait.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI said I would wait. But I had my fingers crossed.\n\nThe day before the first day of school, I bought a Jansport backpack, a crisp pair of Air Force Ones and some baggy jeans.\n\nYes, I decided to go to Teaneck High School, blend in with the scenery and observe Lady Luck on the first day of school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wore my disguise to work to get approval.\n\nRiggs Morales, then the Associate Editor at The Source, looked me up and down carefully.\n\n\u201cYo, you really look like you\u2019re in high school,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut don\u2019t get the kicks dirty before tomorrow. No high school kid would come on the first day with anything on their Ones.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded dutifully and listened to all the other act-like-a-high-schooler-advice.\n\n(Looking back, I don\u2019t know what the big deal was. It was 1999. I had graduated from high school nine years before. It\u2019s not like I was 40 years old, married with two kids and a dog trying to pull it off. But I felt very conspicuous. I did not think I could pass for a high school student.)\n\nThe next day, a car service picked me up from my apartment in Brooklyn at 5:30 in the morning and took me to Teaneck, New Jersey. The driver was a bit confused by the baggy-jeans and baseball-hat wearing chick in the back seat but he didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI made the driver park a block away and told him not to leave until I came back.\n\nThere were throngs of kids heading to the main entrance to the school. I didn\u2019t stand out at all and no one gave me a second glance. I circled around the entire school to make sure there were no other entrances. When I saw that there was only one open, I posted up and waited.\n\nThirty minutes later, whispers started to travel to where I stood.\n\nThere was Lady Luck, a gleaming Def Jam chain around her neck, walking up to the entrance like a candidate on the campaign trail. A few kids took pictures of her. One kid even walked up and asked for her autograph. She shook hands with folks and waved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was also being trailed by a reporter, an older guy who was scribbling furiously in a notebook.\n\nI smiled to myself. I got exactly what I wanted. I saw the awesome scene of Luck\u2019s first day. And Gaby would never even know I was there. I watched Luck interact with the reporter and the kids, taking notes and absorbing the scene.\n\nI packed up, turned to leave and found myself face to face with security and administrators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go! Everybody inside. Report to your first period class immediately!\u201d\n\nI panicked and tried to break away from the pack of the kids heading into the building.\n\n\u201cNope, let\u2019s go young lady,\u201d said a principal-type, herding me inside the building with the rest of the kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTen seconds later, I am now INSIDE Teaneck High School, walking down a random hallway. I figured I\u2019d just fake like I was trying to find my class for a few seconds and then make a break for it out of one of the side exits.\n\nExcept there was a security guard glaring at me at every single exit door.\n\nI\u2019m standing at a locker, trying to figure out what to do and I see Luck walk right past me, with a gaggle of friends, laughing and talking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI figured since I was stuck in the building, (while The New Yorker reporter was still outside), I\u2019d get more color for my story.\n\nI kept a safe distance and took mental notes on Luck\u2019s interactions with her friends, (who were acting more like her sycophantic entourage, laughing too hard at all her jokes and looking around to see who could see them with her).\n\nAfter a few minutes of that, I was good to go. I had to get out of there before my driver left me. I turned to try to find an unmanned exit door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHey you!\u201d someone shouted out.\n\nI froze. Then kept walking.\n\n\u201cYo!\u201d\n\nI turned around. Luck was walking towards me.\n\n\u201cYou go here?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t go here last year did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d I said. \u201cI just transferred.\u201d\n\n[Note: WHY DIDN\u2019T I JUST SAY NO I DON\u201dT GO HERE I JUST CAME TO GET SOMETHING?!]\n\nLuck looked me over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Luck,\u201d she said. She smiled bright. \u201cWelcome to Teaneck High.\u201d\n\nI thought I was going to pass out.\n\nNext thing I know, I am now IN Luck\u2019s entourage as they trail the halls, looking into classroom windows, waving at folks and generally acting up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA security guard began to approach and all the kids scattered. Luck grabbed me and walked me down a hallway.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your schedule?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll show you where your class is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014 I don\u2019t have a schedule,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI didn\u2019t get it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay,\u201d said Luck. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you to guidance. They\u2019ll print one out for you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI protested, trying to tell Luck it was okay. But she insisted, practically dragging me into the guidance office. There was a long line of kids waiting to speak with a counselor so I had a minute to think.\n\n\u201cThanks Luck,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can go. I\u2019ll get my schedule.\u201d\n\nThe plan was to get to the counter, tell them I needed transcripts for my sister or something. And then break out. But Luck wasn\u2019t having it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ll stay. They try to act funny-style on the first day of school.\u201d\n\nI remember being completely petrified at the whole ordeal. But I also remember thinking as a reporter, how dope Luck was. She truly didn\u2019t know me from a hole in the wall. And though I think she was doing a little grandstanding in her own way, she seemed to be genuinely concerned about this new kid who didn\u2019t know where to go. She probably also wanted a reason to keep roaming the halls instead of going to class.\n\nWhen I was next in line, I knew I had to think of something. I heard each counselor ask the same thing to each student: Name? Birthday?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was I going to say? I was the same age, if not older, than a few of the teachers in that school! Exactly one year before that day? I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY TEACHER.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw a familiar face. It was a teacher from my old school! I knew she\u2019d transferred to a different school. What were the flipping odds she was HERE of all places. She was on the phone. But her eyes lit up when she saw me. She motioned for me to wait for her to get off the phone.\n\n\u201cLuck, I need to use the bathroom,\u201d I said. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nI got out of line and fast-walked out of the guidance office.\n\n\u201cYou ai-ight yo?\u201d Luck asked.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I said.\n\nLuck showed me to the bathroom.\n\n\u201cCome inside,\u201d I said.\n\nLuck gave me a look like she was questioning her decision to take me under her wing. But she came inside the bathroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI grabbed her shoulders.\n\n\u201cLuck, I\u2019m not a new student here.\u201d\n\nShe stepped back.\n\n\u201cThen who the hell are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Aliya.

She and her husband, Jamal, planned three parties over one weekend and had $43,000 in cash on hand that her husband was taking to the bank around 11 a.m. As Jamal stopped to talk to his friends, Baltimore City Sgt. Wayne Jenkins and his partner pulled up and searched his car.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey find a small bag of marijuana, but that\u2019s a lie. But they use it as an opportunity to arrest him,\u201d defense attorney Ivan Bates told The Root. \u201cThey submit $23,000 and keep $20,000 for themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst of it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Bates, this was a regular tactic used by Baltimore City police to get the addresses of people whom they considered high rollers because they had expensive cars.\n\n\n\nThey then went to Jovonne Walker\u2019s house and tried to break in. Jovonne was so frightened that she pushed the silent alarm button. According to Bates, a new set of officers showed up in response to the alarm, but Jenkins and his partner said that they would handle it. They searched the house without a warrant, saying that Jovonne agreed to let them search. They later went back and obtained a warrant. They found two guns that Jovonne owned, and charged her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the aftermath of their arrests, the couple almost lost their house. Jamal, who worked as an electrician, wasn\u2019t able to get some clearances to work. One of their cars was repossessed.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo have your life turned upside down for almost two years, to not be able to work in a field that you\u2019re passionate about because you have pending charges. Fearing for my kids\u2019 life because someone was trying to get into our home. It was unfair,\u201d said Jovonne in a press conference with other victims of misconduct by the officers in the Gun Trace Task Force who were prosecuted by federal officials.\n\n\n\nThe federal conviction of eight of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s former Gun Trace Task Force officers\u2014Detectives Daniel T. Hersl, Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Jemell Rayam, Maurice Ward and Marcus R. Taylor, and Sgts. Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins\u2014for levels of corruption that range from breaking into citizens\u2019 houses and robbing them of cash, robbing drug dealers with ski masks and selling the drugs, and racketeering conspiracy to covering up police-involved killings, filing for unearned overtime pay, planting evidence, and performing searches without warrants as well as illegal stop and seizures has reverberations for their victims who are seeking justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office estimates that \u201cthousands\u201d of cases have been tainted by the convictions of the officers. Defense attorneys like Deborah Levi, who leads an initiative by the public defender\u2019s office to track police misconduct, and Ivan Bates estimate the number at around 3,000 after a case search.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s conservative when we say 3,000,\u201d Levi told The Root. \u201cThat only goes back to 2011. It\u2019s safe to say you could go back to 2008 for Rayam, 2006 for Gondo, probably 2010 for Jenkins and Hersl.\u201d\n\n\n\nBates is representing at least 20 clients who were arrested just by Sgt. Jenkins alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour officers in the Gun Trace Task Force case admitted to committing crimes dating back to 2010 or earlier. Ten more officers are being accused based on court testimony in which they were named. Federal prosecutors say that their investigation continues. Prosecutors used the racketeering statute that they usually use against drug crews and gangs for these officers. The corruption was so far-reaching that it included bail bondsmen who were sold drugs given to them by officers and police officers from other jurisdictions, like Philadelphia, who were involved.\n\n\n\nMany of the officers had racked up dozens of citizen complaints before this trial. Many citizens of Baltimore aren\u2019t surprised about any of the evidence that has come up in trial; they have complained about this abuse for years, often to deaf ears.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has been fired and a new commissioner, Darryl DeSousa, appointed by the mayor. The Police Department has since said that it will implement a fingerprint-scanning technology to thwart overtime fraud and will start ordering polygraph tests on members of specialized units. In the midst of the trial, Baltimore went 12 days without a murder in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more complicated about the dismissal of tainted cases is that out of thousands of cases, inevitably there will be not just innocent victims of police abuse, but people who have committed crimes against the community who will walk because of these officers\u2019 abuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from an actual innocence case where DNA exonerates everyone and everyone feels good about that,\u201d Levi acknowledged. \u201cThese are people who have alleged to have committed a crime, and that\u2019s less sexy to the community. The question is, how can you let these people go? But our answer to that is the government is in power and these are ill-gotten gains by the government. The focus is on the fact that this was a massive abuse of power. If we let the government abuse its power, then we have shredded democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victim, Andre Crowder, said during the press conference that officers pulled him over for an alleged seat belt violation and searched his car, finding a gun. He claims that $10,000 was taken later during a search of his home. He was in jail for three days before he could post bail. In that time, his 3-year-old died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a victim of this corruption in this city,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cI was taken away from my family for three days and I lost my 3-year-old son. It\u2019s bigger than the mark they put on my record.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one case, prosecutors say, police handcuffed one man, took his house keys, broke into a safe in his basement and stole $100,000 out of $200,000 found in the safe, and filmed a video showing them discovering the smaller amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese criminals that hid behind a badge and preyed on the African-American community, they didn\u2019t care about anything other than if you had money. The whole system relies on the credibility of the officers who make the arrests,\u201d Bates said. \u201cA number of retirements have happened. There\u2019s a new police commissioner. It\u2019s gonna take a while to change the culture. But you have to prosecute the officers that are doing it and hold them accountable.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["baltimore", "gun", "drugs", "bates", "pick", "abuse", "jenkins", "sold", "officers", "house", "pieces", "killings", "stole", "jovonne", "covered", "city", "say"], "polarity": 0.020850306342109614, "subjectivity": 0.40127510922592896},

Not because her distinct sound of music sounded as if one of God\u2019s angels drank a fifth of gin and figured out a way to plug an extension cord into its harp. It wasn\u2019t because I was listening to something that was recorded in the 1930s that sounded like Prince had laid it down in a studio yesterday.\n\nIt was the erasure.\n\nBecause not finding out about Sister Rosetta Tharpe\u2019s existence until my third decade on the planet meant everything could be a lie. If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said that she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said that his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cgodmother of rock and roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cforgotten mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Rosetta Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, but her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man,\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["woman", "music", "gospel", "invented", "little", "roll", "recorded", "black", "n", "tharpe", "rosetta", "rock", "queer", "sister"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

And her formula is eco-friendly on every level, with no animal testing and no toxic ingredients, and it\u2019s entirely made in America. Cue the chorus of \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman.\u201d\n\nI met Napier three years ago, when she approached me on the street outside the Makeup Show in New York City. I thought she was going to ask me for modeling tips, but it was she who schooled me in the \u201cthe beauty of taking it all off.\u201d She placed a simple, black foil packet in my palm with her name written on it, smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m Lauren. This is the best way to cleanse your skin.\u201d She then hailed a cab and disappeared. The impression she left stayed with me\u2014I knew she\u2019d be one to watch.\n\nI tossed the packet into my bag and retrieved it a few days later, to remove heavy on-camera makeup. The wipes came in two formulations: Cleanse, for normal skin, and Flaunt, for mature and sensitive skin types. They felt great\u2014soft like a chamois cloth\u2014while the formula had a serumlike texture. Most important, they did the cleanup job in one go, without leaving my face feeling stripped. Definitely an exceptional product in a beautiful package.\n\nBut as lovely as the experience of using them had been, I wondered: Would they catch on? As opposed to a basic drugstore brand, which averages $8 for a 25-count packet, Napier\u2019s price tag is a hefty $20 for 15 wipes. I\u2019d get my answer a few short months later, in the form of an email from luxury retailer Net-a-Porter: Napier\u2019s wipes had been added to its roster of prestige products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNapier, with a background as a film-and-television makeup artist, traces her accomplishments to her grandparents\u2014and their parents.\n\n\u201cAll four of my great-grandparents were entrepreneurs,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was huge in the black community at that time in the South. My mother\u2019s parents owned a steakhouse that served the chitlin circuit\u2014Ike and Tina [Turner] and B.B. King used to come through and perform and dine.\u201d\n\nHer paternal grandfather had a farm and a mortuary. \u201cThe spirit of being creative and proactive lives within me,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCall it desperation or inspiration, but it struck Napier on a flight from Australia to Dubai, when she found her cleansing wipes dried out and her facial mist spilled in her bag, leaving her in a full face of makeup on a long-haul flight.\n\nArriving in Dubai, she couldn\u2019t find a convenient, effective, yet restorative wipe to cleanse her face. Napier suddenly saw a white space in the crowded and competitive luxury-cosmetics market. \u201cWomen spend a lot of time and effort on prestige makeup, and you want the same quality of experience when you\u2019re taking your makeup off, as well,\u201d she says.\n\nNapier called it. The market was ready for her product.\n\nAlong with entrepreneurship, glamour is in Napier\u2019s blood. Growing up between Las Vegas and Texas, Napier drew equal inspiration from the showgirls on the Vegas Strip and Ann Richards, then the governor of Texas. \u201cShe had that Southern-belle charm. Southern gusto. You always knew who she was,\u201d Napier says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing a go-getter who gets it done her way is in her blood, too. It\u2019s a spirit that informs everything behind her brand.\n\n\u201cI felt like if I was going to put my name on a product, it had to have the same kind of integrity that I carry myself with in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially in these times, it\u2019s important that underserved communities are being employed. I was heavily influenced by Obama\u2019s administration to make a positive impact, socially and environmentally.\u201d\n\nPutting that influence into action, Napier uses solar-powered manufacturing facilities owned by a Chinese-American female immigrant. During our interview, Napier is speaking from the floor of the co-packing company she uses, specifically chosen because it employs \u201chandi-capable\u201d workers, who are either mentally or physically impaired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose are two communities who are often overlooked or underserved, and I wanted to make sure they were included,\u201d she says. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to be a huge brand one day. Doing good is a big part of my story.\u201d\n\nNapier\u2019s ideas and inspiration weren\u2019t backed up by formal business training or an angel investor. In fact, her dream literally almost went up in smoke before she even began.\n\nKnowing that she wanted to create some kind of beauty business, Napier had adhered to a strict financial plan to clean up her credit from college loans. And then, close to meeting her startup goal, her house burned down\u2014and her insurance company refused her a payout. Recovery took another seven years, and finally saving $4,000, which she combined with a tax refund and an American Express card that \u201cmade things happen a lot faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNapier says, \u201cI never let the fact that I have no formal business education scare me.\u201d Her antidote to fear? \u201cPick up the phone and ask questions. I don\u2019t fear rejection.\u201d\n\nIt shows: Napier does all her own marketing and press, landing herself in both the storied pages of Vogue and the hallowed halls of Net-a-Porter, which she initially tagged on Instagram. \u201cI just had to be there,\u201d she says. Then comes a somewhat stunning revelation from a woman who seems\u2014well, so naturally perfect:\n\n\u201cBeing bullied made me fearless,\u201d she shares. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. I always encourage people who are going through it to look inside and find themselves. I\u2019m the same person now; I just look different.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer voice becomes supercharged with a kind of elegant authority: \u201cAnd one day, I won\u2019t look like this, either; but I\u2019ll still have the same wisdom and personality.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for Lauren Napier? \u201c J. Crew just put me in the store for their holiday beauty collection,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m right at the register.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Napier\u2019s capable hands, the business built on taking it all off is definitely taking off:\n\n\u201cBeing in business is like wearing a heart monitor: You\u2019re up, and then your down. The only thing you never want is for your heart to stop.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Treat yourself\u2014or someone who deserves a skin splurge\u2014to the gift of Lauren Napier.

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["know", "help", "wanted", "folks", "history", "killmonger", "black", "njobu", "cant", "panther", "revisionist", "riots", "tchalla"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked. Internships are a critical part of the process for successful careers, and Fashion Tech Connects is there to provide qualified candidates with both education and, for those who rise to the top, entree into coveted fashion internships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we look at the current landscape of technology and fashion leadership, there is an obvious lack of women of color,\u201d says Horton, whose new executive role at Alexander Wang was reportedly the inspiration behind this season\u2019s fashion show, featuring models dressed as an army of high-powered female executives.\n\nIf Horton has her way, squads of black female power brokers are about to be on the next runway to reality 2.0.", "keywords": ["alexander", "women", "vogue", "soars", "fashion", "marketing", "horton", "wang", "stephanie", "business", "tech", "doesnt", "executive", "york"], "polarity": 0.19978698550127125, "subjectivity": 0.4454098811241669},

This, despite her appearance as Lourdes \u201cLuLu\u201d Blackmon in Netflix\u2019s recent series reboot of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It; a scene-stealing supporting role that has literally sent Hollywood calling (as evidenced by the feature-film audition she\u2019d sent off just prior to our conversation).\n\nPersonally asked to audition by Lee himself after attending an open studio event at 40 Acres and a Mule, Benitez took a chance and went for it, attending a series of castings and screen tests before landing the role of Lourdes, Mars Blackmon\u2019s Santeria-practicing sister. (Fun fact: Hamilton alum Anthony Ramos was the first cast, as a now Puerto Rican Mars.) On-screen, Benitez was a natural, radiating equal parts high-strung Brooklyn Boricua and shamanic grace in her acting debut.\n\nBut Benitez\u2019s first on-screen experience was a bit more spontaneous as she juggled both a blind date and a mystery basket on Food Network\u2019s hit show Chopped\u2014and walked away with the win.\n\nThe chef\u2014who holds diplomas in both culinary and culinary management from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York City\u2014initially found her calling while stationed in Germany with the Air Force, having also grown up an Air Force \u201cbrat,\u201d born in England and raised in California, Panama, Texas, Turkey and Washington, D.C., before starting her own military career.\n\nAnd, like the military, cooking is in her blood:\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve always been into cooking; my mom\u2019s a bomb cook, her mother is ... food has always been a big part of my life. But moving [to Germany] and living 30 minutes from the French border, going to get wine and cheese and all kinds of foods from different markets, that made me think about food in a more gourmet sense. ... I grew up always eating really good food, but living there put me in the mind frame of elevated food: the presentation, the markets and the whole culture around food there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, she\u2019d intended to channel that passion into food writing, starting a Tumblr in 2010 called I\u2019ll Cook Like Your Mother, the title inspired by a Badu lyric. Today, I\u2019ll Cook Like Your Mother is a full-fledged business and blog, offering catering, events and culinary education from Chef Santana herself. A scroll through her food gallery is a seriously sensual experience; and while Benitez is well-versed in a variety of cuisines, when asked for her favorite, her response was just as sexy: \u201cI really like Asian flavors\u2014I like the umami: that tart, that sweet, that spicy that Asian food brings.\u201d\n\nOn the day of our interview, Benitez stuffed 200 empanadas for a nonprofit organization empowering women, a service she happily renders whenever a cause resonates with her. But left to her own devices\u2014or in collaboration with fellow chef and friend Jade Verette as newly minted culinary team For the Culture Catering\u2014she likes \u201clots of colors, lots of flavor, and just, you know ... fun shit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer heritage is equally colorful, as the third of four daughters of a black-and-Italian mother and Puerto Rican father raised in nearby St. Croix. For her, it\u2019s a type of mixed heritage that too often goes ignored:\n\nWhen people think of \u2018mixed\u2019 [people], a lot of times, their heads just go to half-white, half-black. As a mixed woman, I don\u2019t relate to [that], because my family\u2014on both sides\u2014are black ... and it\u2019s like, the culture is different, but the same. I don\u2019t have a \u2018white side\u2019 of my family; it\u2019s just different brands of black, on both sides.\n\nWhen she is asked what her \u201cblack on both sides\u201d holiday will look like this year, Benitez\u2019s answer is delicious: \u201cIt looks like a lot of coquito, pastelillos, roast pernil [pork shoulder], arroz con gandules, prime rib, ham, greens, mac and cheese. ... It\u2019s all just one big, beautiful mesh of good-ass food.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHell, yeah.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation.

She\u2019s a woman who would know, given her degree from Harvard in ninth- to 14th-century Arabic literature and diplomacy. For nine years, Akkad has held the position of senior vice president of local and cultural innovation at Est\u00e9e Lauder, overseeing multiethnic innovation for some 25 brands under the Lauder umbrella, including La Mer, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. But Akkad\u2019s journey to the top of the beauty business had an unlikely beginning: It began at age 19, when she went off to do a semester abroad at the American University in Cairo in 1984.\n\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous, sunny afternoon in New York City, and Akkad and I are having lunch at Freds in Barneys New York on Madison Avenue, where fashion folk gather to see and be seen. Over salads and crab cakes (we split the fries), Akkad recounts her student days in Egypt.\n\n\u201cEgypt wasn\u2019t conservative at all at that time; women were in Western dress, and the caf\u00e9 at the American University was the big expat hangout for students and diplomatic hopefuls like myself,\u201d she says, adding a caveat that adds significant intrigue. \u201cEvery spy in the world was crawling the campus and lounging in the caf\u00e9 looking for recruits.\u201d\n\nThe American University Caf\u00e9 was also where Susan spied the love of her life: fellow student and theater major Ahmed Akkad. The two have now been married for over 30 years.\n\nEgypt is also where she began what would become a lifelong love affair with beauty and fragrance. In the age of the pharaohs, men and women alike wore statement eyeliner and fabulous wigs; to this day, fragrance in Egypt remains a daily multilayered ritual where everything from hair to furniture is perfumed like the wearer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrushing aside dreams of a diplomatic career, Susan relocated with her new husband to New York, where they placed their priorities on making a living\u2014no obvious feat, with two very esoteric degrees (his is in comparative literature and theater). While Ahmed launched a fashion line, Susan found a job as assistant to the sportswear editor at American Vogue, which paid $15,000 a year in 1986. In need of more money, she quickly moved on to a (slightly) better-paying job as a public relations assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder. Starting salary? $16,000.\n\nLanding a job in beauty after dreams of a diplomatic career may seem odd, but in the buttoned-up multinational corporate world of luxury beauty, it was once de rigueur to hire the wives of State Department officials in public relations and similar roles in international business. Their experience organizing official dinners, navigating the social and international worlds, and connections to wealthy society made them the organic influencers of that time.\n\nAs an entry-level assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder, Susan was allowed the chance to watch and learn from all departments. She laughs as she recalls getting dry-cleaning and throwing birthday parties for a boss\u2019s cat as part of her duties. What she learned was what it takes to work every rung of the corporate ladder; but most important, she learned that she loved the beauty biz\u2014especially fragrance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Ahmed\u2019s fashion line took off as a global luxury brand, Susan left the corporate world to work in her husband\u2019s company. In 1995, Ahmed sold the fashion brand to his manufacturers to start interiors, accessories and other businesses. Susan was now unemployed, and through some recommendations from friends, she found her way to Lanc\u00f4me as director of fragrance.\n\nSusan Akkad was soon recruited back to Est\u00e9e Lauder, where she served in various global marketing positions for almost 10 years before being installed in her current post as senior VP of local and cultural innovation, responsible for multiethnic innovation. What exactly does multicultural innovation entail? In this role, Akkad partners with the many brands under Est\u00e9e Lauder to advise on multicultural strategy and the best ways to tailor products and communication to be more meaningful to women of color.\n\nHer post at Lauder affords her a global view of the beauty of black and brown women, who, she tells me, are more confident about their looks than their white counterparts. As a culture, we black women historically have primarily based our self-esteem surrounding our looks on the opinions within our community, rather than on mainstream media standards. Akkad recounts being asked why certain products advertised as corrective were not appealing to black women. To which she would answer, that\u2019s because \u201cwhen you market a product to black women as if there is something wrong with them that needs fixing, black women simply don\u2019t relate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking me straight in the eye, Akkad lightly brushes back one of her naturally ink-black curls and straightens the peaked lapel of her black Junya Watanabe tuxedo suit. She tells me matter-of-factly, \u201cMarketing is diplomacy.\u201d", "keywords": ["knows", "women", "beauty", "susan", "akkad", "american", "fixed", "fashion", "black", "dont", "innovation", "need", "lauder", "multiculturaland", "making", "est\u00e9e"], "polarity": 0.12378940503940505, "subjectivity": 0.3435481185481185},

Resolution 40, a bill that overturned a rule designed to prevent certain people with mental health problems from buying a gun. The optics are especially bad given that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz used his legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle to gun down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\u201cA White House photographer confirmed to CBS News that there are photos of the bill signing.

CBS News notes that had the measure stayed in effect, about 75,000 names of Americans with mental health issues and receiving Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income would have been sent to a database, thus stopping them from buying a gun.\n\nShortly after Trump signed his measure, the National Rifle Association put out a press release quoting NRA Executive Director Chris Cox: \u201cToday marks a new era for law-abiding gun owners, as we have now have a president who respects and supports our right to keep and bear arms,\u201d CBS News reports.\n\nGood to see that Trump is respecting his right-to-bear-arms-loving base and that the White House is up to its usual tricks of trying to scrub the memory of a bill removing mental health restrictions on gun ownership, given that Trump gave a six-minute speech after the Florida shooting, not about guns or gun laws, but about\u2014you guessed it\u2014mental health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been revised to clarify that the Obama rule would not have prevented the tragedy in Florida, since, as far as we know, Nikolas Cruz was not on SSI or SSDI.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "refuses", "overturned", "mental", "house", "cbs", "health", "restrictions", "president", "bill", "report", "rule", "release", "trump", "signing"], "polarity": 0.021817416590143857, "subjectivity": 0.36739122830031923},

Bush and a current professor at Georgetown University Law Center, was nominated by President Donald Trump this week to sit on a federal commission that sets policy on how to punish criminals.\n\nIt would come as no surprise that Otis is a staunch supporter of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 hard-line approach of imposing mandatory minimum sentences and resurrecting the war on drugs. But Otis, thanks to his popular legal blog, Crime and Consequences, has also made his racist beliefs both explicit and easily searchable.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, Otis once defended a federal judge who was called out for saying that black and Latinx people were more violent than white people.\n\nIn a 2013 post he titled, \u201cThe PC Attempt to Intimidate Judges,\u201d Otis wrote:\n\nWhen Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites, a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. ... The complaint calls for stern discipline on the grounds that the remarks were \u201cdiscriminatory and biased.\u201d So far as I have been able to discover, it makes no mention of the fact that they\u2019re true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Post noted, Otis dug himself further into the racist-commentary trenches in the comments section, where Otis saw fit to compare black people to Asians, whom he called \u201cOrientals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrientals,\u201d Otis claimed, have a lower incidence of crime than other groups because they have the right values. Here is that passage in full:\n\nThis is the reason that, for example, Orientals have less incidence of crime than whites. Orientals were unquestionably the victims of long and rancid racial bigotry; coolie labor was little more than slave labor. And Yick Wo v. Hopkins is one of the most famous civil rights cases of all time. The reason Orientals stay out of jail more than either whites or blacks is that family life, work, education and tradition are honored more in Oriental culture than in others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, of course, is flatly ahistorical. While Asian groups have certainly been discriminated against, that treatment simply cannot be compared to the history of anti-black racism in the U.S. \u201cCoolie labor,\u201d as Otis puts it (the term is dated and derogatory, and refers to Asian laborers) is not comparable to over 200 years of chattel slavery.\n\nIn the same post, Otis also flatly denied that white people\u2019s racial bigotry caused black people to \u201cmake ... more criminal choices.\u201d\n\nAs if trying to hit all the twisted, racist lines of \u201clogic\u201d that he could, Otis next brought up Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as his example of a good black person with the \u201cright values\u201d:\n\nValues, not race or skin color, influence choices. Some of the bravest men in public life \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas comes to mind \u2014 had the \u201cwrong\u201d skin color but the right values (see Thomas\u2019s autobiography, \u201cMy Grandfather\u2019s Son\u201d). They made honorable and courageous choices, and succeeded. This is one of the reasons the grievance-monger crowd \u2014 the people who now want to hammer Judge Jones \u2014 have a special hate for Justice Thomas.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Thomas\u2019 values apparently include perjury and harassment of women apparently evaded the Georgetown law professor.\n\nThe Post also found another blog from 2014 in which Otis referred to an offender sarcastically as \u201cMr. Nicey.\u201d The post was written in response to a bill called the \u201cSmarter Sentencing Act\u201d that would have reduced sentences for some drug and low-level offenders.\n\nHere\u2019s what he wrote:\n\nLast I looked, when you needle yourself with too much heroin, you\u2019re still dead; when a thug belts you to grab your purse, you still have a knot on your head and no purse; and when Mr. Nicey rapes your eight year-old, you still have a defiled little girl to try to help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bears repeating: Trump\u2019s pick for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which determines what criminal sentences to dole out, has written that black and Latinx people commit more crimes because of their collective substandard values, and appears to think that selling an eighth of an ounce of weed (a low-level offense) is akin to child rape.\n\nThe comments that Otis has made on his blog aren\u2019t racist dog whistles. They\u2019re the air horn of racism. They\u2019re also terrifyingly recent\u2014all made within the last five years.\n\nOtis\u2019 nomination was announced on Thursday and is one of four that Trump made.

The topic Smith chose for discussion was \u201cBridging the Gap Between East and West of the River.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith counts herself as not only a resident but also an advocate for education and economic development in D.C.\u2019s Ward 7. Smith\u2019s neighborhood, where she lives with her husband and two kids, is an area known for the highest levels of poverty and reported crime east of the Anacostia River. Even though the Smiths\u2019 Escape Lounge is located on a trendy street west of the river, Ayana Smith chose to open their home on the economically challenged East Side because she \u201cwanted to showcase all the good that\u2019s happening here east of the river.\u201d\n\nLooking back on the dinner and her chosen topic, Smith tells me, \u201cWe never even got to the topic.\u201d The people who showed up were predominantly white, and Smith says she was shocked by how much they cared and wanted to talk about issues that affect the black community. After that first gathering in July, she began having regular #AskMe group dinners to further the dialogue. The resulting conversations prompted the concept for the tees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explains: \u201cHearing \u2018That\u2019s not a community you want to go into unless you\u2019re looking to get shot\u2019 is a [common warning] that white people in our #AskMe group encountered when they shared that they were coming to my home. We help each other understand ways to deal with and how to respond to questions about race that can be awkward to approach or difficult to answer.\u201d\n\n#AskMeTees was born out of that personal frustration; not only from assumptions made about her neighborhood but from other offenses\u2014like strangers walking up to her kids and touching their hair. As Smith recounts, \u201cMost other people are teaching their kids not to let strangers touch them, so why do you think it\u2019s OK to walk up and start touching my kids?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the impetus behind the \u201c#AskMe Why You Can\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d shirt. \u201cLiving while black\u201d was another motivator for launching this T-shirt line\u2014only 10 days old as of press time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume anything about me,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAsk me!\u201d\n\nFor instance, Smith hates rings and doesn\u2019t wear a wedding ring. Because of that, \u201cpeople assume that my kids don\u2019t have a father.\u201d Yet, to the contrary, they have two excellent and deeply involved parents.\n\n\u201cI think people are often afraid to be on the wrong side of an issue, and so they stay quiet around family and colleagues, but the conversations people might possibly have with strangers can be a lot more candid,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#AskMe T-shirts come with rules, Smith asserts, talking a mile a minute: \u201cYou better wear your #AskMe tee on the day when you\u2019re in the mood to talk and educate people in meaningful conversation.\u201d\n\nAn entrepreneur at heart\u2014Smith is currently developing an app for an in-home play version of the Escape Lounge\u2014and a member of Black Female Founders, she printed the words \u201c#AskMe About My Start-Up\u201d to encourage entrepreneurs to practice their pitch as much as possible. That said, Smith doesn\u2019t expect open congress to break out on the streets for everyone wearing one of her tees.\n\nBut she\u2019s hoping that if you catch the right conversation on the right day, the messages will plant a seed and bear the fruit of healthy, respectful debate\u2014and maybe even sprout a money tree.", "keywords": ["white", "topic", "tees", "chest", "talking", "smith", "day", "black", "kids", "east", "askme", "strangers", "say", "talk"], "polarity": 0.07740278727120832, "subjectivity": 0.50589877958299},

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects.

While I\u2019m none too fond of female leaders being posited as the fallback plan for a dysfunctional patriarchy, rather than the highly qualified corrective measure, recent research\u2014including a Gallup poll\u2014seems to agree with our 44th president.\n\nAs reported by CNBC Make It., a recently updated 2012 study by leadership-development firm Zenger Folkman revealed that \u201cwomen scored higher than men in 13 out of the 16 leadership competencies Folkman\u2019s research measure for, tying only for their tendency to be innovative.\u201d\n\nAlso notable is that the study also considered women an \u201cuntapped resource,\u201d despite our prevalence in the workforce. Company president and psychometrician Joe Folkman explained that this could likely be an issue of confidence\u2014on the part of not just working women but also the companies that employ them.\n\n\u201cIn organizations where women don\u2019t feel like second-class citizens and they don\u2019t feel abused, they actually feel empowered.

And yet a 2016 study produced by the American Association of University Women (pdf) indicates that black women occupy a mere 8 percent of private-sector jobs, and only 2 percent of leadership roles.\n\nSo while the leadership potential is there, it remains untapped.

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them?

We held off on these requests because we wanted to stabilize our model and strategize intentionally on the best way to bring our work to more communities.\u201d\n\nKnowing they\u2019re onto something makes Demmellash that much more motivated to serve.\n\n\u201cWe often hear people say, \u2018A rising tide lifts all boats,\u2019 but what if you don\u2019t have a boat?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat if you are an aspiring entrepreneur with a viable business idea in an area where there are no resources available to you? What I\u2019ve found is that the only difference between entrepreneurs in Rwanda or Jersey City versus Silicon Valley is access to resources and opportunities. A recent Project Diane report found that, on average, black women founders raise $36,000 in venture funding, while $1.3 million goes to failed startups owned mostly by white men. Rising Tide Capital exists to give underserved entrepreneurs the same access to financial and support networks\u2014to build those boats.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo participate in Rising Tide Capital\u2019s Community Business Academy, you must be over 18 years old with an idea or talent that you would like to grow into a viable business, and have some experience in the industry in which you want to grow your business.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence. He\u2019s made that clear.\n\nThe somewhat shocking reveal here is that maybe Suckabee doesn\u2019t care, either.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sad.", "keywords": ["white", "violence", "house", "allegations", "statements", "tweets", "supports", "president", "say", "sanders", "domestic", "huckabee", "sexual", "trump", "victims", "sarah"], "polarity": 0.035624403844742844, "subjectivity": 0.4193398879839558},

Is this because it would make it harder for a certain section of America (read: bootleg dentistry and fat-tire-pickup drivers) to purchase guns at gun shows?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a gun show?\u201d you ask? Well, that is where people who have guns (read: tabacky-chewing, Hulk Hogan-loving Americans) sell guns to other Americans (read: mesh-hat-wearing, NASCAR-loving white men) with little to no requirements other than that said Budweiser-drinking American has the correct amount to purchase said firearm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to stop this nonsense,\u201d the president said. Trump then added that police should be able to take civilians\u2019 firearms without a court order, to which all of the GOP Congress members in the room began looking at their phones. Apparently the NRA sent out a mass text stating, \u201cFuck that shit! Someone needs to start choking to end this meeting!\u201d A few members coughed, but no one actually faked a full choking scene.\n\n\u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d Trump suggested.\n\n\n\nThe president then straight-up slammed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is pushing a bill to broaden background checks. Trump asked Toomey if his plan included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21. Toomey told the president it did not. To which the president replied: \u201cYou know why , bitch ? Because you\u2019re afraid of the NRA.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats might be spineless, but they aren\u2019t stupid. Many noted that the president is batshit crazy, and therefore took little interest in his newfound ways. Fine, they didn\u2019t actually call him batshit crazy, but they know he is.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that this was the beginning and the end of the president\u2019s advocacy on this issue.

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

And people of color, women and anyone who can be identified as \u201cother\u201d on a census form became even more obvious targets of overt prejudice, racist violence and blatant sexism.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it.

Trump governs by toxic masculinity and white supremacy. And he is taking a sledgehammer to opportunity and protective programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Title IX and Obama-era measures that would require companies to disclose how much they pay workers in order to address the gender pay gap.\n\nAccording to the research group Catalyst, women of color often lack the support (pdf) needed to move up the ranks in their workplace. They also face challenges for \u201csticking out\u201d and in trying to \u201cblend in.\u201d The report concluded that \u201c[b]ecause corporate environments typically do not reflect the behavioral norms common to the cultural backgrounds of women of color, these women may have to go to great lengths to adjust to the corporate environment and to network effectively.\u201d\n\nSo the rest of us have to step up and support women of color so that they can work in environments that utilize skills, perspectives and experiences that are not always fully expressed or nurtured in white-dominant workplaces. Two words: Ava DuVernay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe visionary filmmaker recently explained that instead of trying to break the glass ceiling, she is focused on \u201cbuilding my own house.\u201d\n\nWe need more Ava DuVernays. And Shonda Rhimeses. And Issa Raes. And Maria Hinojosas. But the rest of us have to put in work so that these gifted women among us can start their own enterprises\u2014to maximize and monetize their talents and possibilities\u2014and set the country on a better path as we prepare to become a majority-minority country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, women of color have already mastered so many of the requisite skills. From their work leading extended intergenerational families to organizing PTAs and church groups and running informal beauty and catering businesses from home, women of color have the human resources acumen to run successful enterprises and to empower employees to do their best work. They delegate, supervise and orchestrate major events like weddings, annual family gatherings, quincea\u00f1eras and large Greek-life gatherings.\n\nFrom these private and public experiences, women of color also emerge with a hard-won emotional intelligence, which a recent study shows is already more abundant in women. Experience shows that women of color have borne the burden of being de facto social workers, group therapists and conflict mitigators at work and school whenever racial tensions and intersectional misunderstandings flare up. The rest of us need to make sure they capitalize on those so-called soft skills.\n\nWe can start supporting women of color right now.\n\nPatronize their online stores and brick-and-mortar restaurants. Support their crowdfunding campaigns. Hire them for corporate projects. Donate to their nonprofits and join as volunteers. Buy their books, artwork and clothing lines. There are many opportunities in our daily lives to be intentional about finding and supporting a woman of color.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["movie", "friend", "designer", "panthers", "teamsupernatural", "traditional", "meet", "think", "black", "panther", "camille", "having", "natural", "hero", "really", "hair"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

Our fairer-skinned, \u201cMAGA\u201d compatriots who order dry whole wheat toast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is d\u2014all of the above.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like a vast, paranoid conspiracy theory, I point you in the direction of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDocuments obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union reveal that for years, the Boston Police Department has been using a sophisticated social media monitoring program to spy on the social media posts of Black Lives Matter activists, Muslims and even high school students in the area, according to Privacy SOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., major cities across the country began creating special intelligence units dedicated to preventing acts of terrorism. These interdepartmental units are basically local versions of the FBI, employing the same kinds of surveillance techniques. They are ostensibly local spy agencies.\n\n\n\nThe New York City Police Department\u2019s intelligence unit monitored text messages from Black Lives Matter members. Baltimore\u2019s version used high-definition cameras attached to planes flying above the city 24 hours a day to monitor activists after the uprising over Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. But maybe none were as sophisticated as the Boston Regional Intelligence Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BPD used a program called Geofeedia that monitored Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms used by any activists with more than a pinch of melanin in their skin. It collected information about political beliefs, social activism, religious activities and regular conversations that had no importance related to criminal activity. It tagged anyone who spoke out against law enforcement.\n\nWhat it did not do is solve a single crime.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make this clear: Geofeedia and the Boston Police Department were not targeting criminal suspects. They were not trying to solve or prevent crimes. The people they surveilled were not even suspected of any past or future wrongdoing. They were just regular black people. They were just ordinary Muslim citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a man named Tito Jackson, for instance. In November 2014, Jackson wrote a Facebook post about being thankful. He talked about helping the citizens of his community pass out turkeys in the days prior to Thanksgiving. He told people to be thankful that they weren\u2019t homeless. But Jackson made a grave mistake in his Facebook post. He mentioned the words \u201cFerguson\u201d and \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d He was now under surveillance.\n\nJackson is not a criminal. Most people wouldn\u2019t even consider him radical. But he was black, which made him a target of the Boston police. There is one more thing that is important to know about Jackson and his targeting:\n\nHe was also a Boston city councilman.\n\nIn March 2016, over 1,000 students walked out of Boston public schools to protest budget cuts. Forty-two percent of students in the Boston Public Schools district are Latinx and 35 percent are black. Only 14 percent are white. Of course, Geofeedia was watching them. The software cataloged the students\u2019 social media communication. As intricately detailed as the program seemed to be, it did not differentiate between harmless private conversation and serious threats. Maybe because \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t care. Or perhaps stopping violence was never the purpose of the software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program also tracked Muslims who used everyday terms in regular communications. Two of the most frequent \u201ctrigger words\u201d that popped up alerts in the system were \u201cummah\u201d\u2014 which roughly translates to \u201ccommunity\u201d in Arabic\u2014and \u201cMuslim Lives Matter\u201d because ... of course. The Islamophobic algorithm resulted in almost every religious service and charitable activity in Boston\u2019s Muslim community being spied on, including events like a Muslims Against Hunger fundraiser.\n\nSupposedly a crime-fighting tool, Geofeedia was used by the BRIC as a virtual, online version of stop and frisk. There is no evidence that the data resulted in a single arrest. (Although, to be fair, a number of teenagers were arrested for recklessly driving their bicycles. Some people suspect it was because the hashtag #BikeLife was a trigger word in the software.) Instead, the software targeted individuals based mainly on their political beliefs and religion.\n\nThe BPD no longer uses Geofeedia\u2014not because it was ineffective or because there is no evidence that it ever helped prevent a single incident of violence, but because Twitter, Facebook and Instagram banned its use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not an isolated occurrence in a single municipality. It is part of the invisible cost of being black or Muslim and speaking above a whisper. Even if you have no nefarious intentions, you will be watched if you are a person of color who uses his or her voice to do ... well ... anything. It is not even about crime prevention, protecting or serving. It is about control. It is about forcing brown mouths to shut the fuck up.\n\nWhether it is giving away food, fighting for education reform or even thanking God, not being white is cause for suspicion in and of itself. The first right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech, religion and assembly because, without it, none of the others are possible. If the people entrusted with enforcing those laws are the ones who violate them, then who in this country is really free?\n\nAdvertisement\n\na. White people.\n\nb. Wypipo.\n\nc.

In the film, Mbatha-Raw plays Dr. Kate Murry, mother to tween Meg Murry (Storm Reid), who embarks on an epic journey to find her father, Alex, played by Chris Pine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a recent Vogue buzz notes, Mbatha-Raw has been \u201cescaping archetypes and quietly shaping a diverse CV for years.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s given riveting performances on both movie and TV screens, playing the title role in the period biopic Belle; showing off her singing skills as a troubled rock star in Beyond the Lights; and taking a time-traveling turn in the iconic, Emmy Award-winning \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode of Black Mirror (which seemed to serve as inspiration for Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s latest video, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d). Mbatha-Raw even manages to be captivating in Netflix\u2019s less-than-stellar recent release, The Cloverfield Paradox.\n\nAnd on the red carpet, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s sartorial growth has been equally impressive. This recent slideshow from Vogue UK tracks Mbatha-Raw\u2019s maturation as she settles into more streamlined, polished shapes with bold colors and textures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt certainly feels like Mbatha-Raw is coming into her moment, though she\u2019s been patiently building her career for decades, starting, as many Brits do, on the stage.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, you have power over your performance, but no power over the distribution or timetable,\u201d she recently told Refinery 29. \u201cSo it just so happens this is all coming out at the same time. But I guess I should embrace the ride!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbatha-Raw also talked about the power of seemingly innocuous beauty choices, like how to wear her hair on-screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to play a woman and not have race be the focus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will always bring who I am to the story and make sure my ethnicity is celebrated on-screen. I\u2019m not afraid to have those tough conversations with directors about how I represent myself. Hair, for instance, sounds like a superficial conversation. But images remain in our subconscious. So when it comes to representing on-screen, I can use my hair to send the important message to girls everywhere that they can be who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: British Vogue\u2019s April issue, featuring Mbatha-Raw\u2019s cover and interview, is available on newsstands Friday, March 9. Coincidentally, March 9 is the same date you can see the actress in the premiere of Ava DuVernay\u2019s A Wrinkle in Time!", "keywords": ["mbatharaws", "magnificence", "vogue", "wrinkle", "mbatharaw", "star", "cover", "recent", "glorious", "power", "actress", "need", "gracing", "redvelvet", "british", "hair", "gugu"], "polarity": 0.17958726025132277, "subjectivity": 0.5524222883597883},

I literally go there every single day when I drop my daughter off for school. I like Old Town just fine, and if I were a (multi) millionaire, I\u2019d buy a house in Alexandria. Floods a bit much for my taste, but ya know, you can\u2019t win them all. But Alexandria is not a tourist destination\u2014not from out of town.\n\nIt\u2019s barely a destination for people who live in D.C. In almost no universe are people paying money to venture specifically to Alexandria. You come to D.C. and then go to Alexandria because the site you on where you booked your hotel made it seem like the hotel was \u201cright outside of Washington, D.C., with views of the Capitol at night!\u201d\n\nNearly every single thing you can do in Alexandria, you can do in D.C., and it ain\u2019t THAT much more expensive. The article mentions cobblestone streets. Georgetown got those. It mentions Alexandria as a jumping-off point for George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon plantation Estate, which is not even in Alexandria. You have to drive THROUGH Alexandria to get there. Again, Old Town is cool ... it\u2019s very quaint. I enjoy going down there on infrequent occasions and watching street performers along the river, and there is lots of shopping along King Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Georgetown, again, whips Alexandria\u2019s ass, and it\u2019s right across the water in D.C. D.C. has all of the museums\u2014you may have heard of the Smithsonian. D.C. has all of the fine eateries and all of the public transportation, and basically, I mean, put it this way, it\u2019s a fine suburb of D.C. to live in or find a fun and interesting thing to do in the off-the-beaten-path CityPaper. Or, like, to go to a concert at the Birchmere.\n\nYou don\u2019t travel from Montana to Alexandria because of the Birchmere, though. This is like that time some folks out in Fairfax County\u2014another suburb of D.C.\u2014tried to float the idea that Tysons Corner was basically turning D.C. into its suburb. Tysons has exploded. It\u2019s got the biggest mall and the mall with all of the high-end stores. Lots of rich people live out yonder. It\u2019s also far. And in nobody\u2019s world is Tysons Corner a draw to the region.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not judging Money\u2019s survey. OK, I\u2019m lying; I\u2019m totally judging their survey. But I\u2019d truly like to understand how a suburb of an actual destination ranks as the No. 1 spot to travel to when nearly EVERYBODY who would visit Alexandria would most assuredly spend the vast majority of their time in the major city next door that is an international tourist destination. How the hell is the hotel spot a top travel destination in any year? Something is awry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen, I\u2019m not saying anybody with some clout made a call. I do know that way back in time, ads for the Almighty RSO kept showing up in The Source magazine, and nobody could understand why because nobody actually ever listened to the Almighty RSO. Yet, every single month, The Source was telling me I needed to check our their album and even gave them a four-and-a-half-mic rating, back when that shit really mattered.\n\nI don\u2019t know if a Benzino-like character runs Money. What I do know is that every single person who reads this survey and says, \u201cHey, honey, we should check out this Alexandria, Va., place!\u201d is assuredly going to end up finding out it\u2019s next to D.C. and say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we just go to D.C. and check out these places in Alexandria on one of our free days!\u201d\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City and other actual tourist destinations made the list.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d\n\nTo donate to Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber\u2019s funeral expenses, go here.", "keywords": ["death", "angeles", "neighborhood", "los", "anthony", "black", "young", "weber", "killing", "aj", "reels", "community", "shot", "16yearold"], "polarity": -0.0647421536796537, "subjectivity": 0.4544421296296296},

Again, Old Town is cool ... it\u2019s very quaint. I enjoy going down there on infrequent occasions and watching street performers along the river, and there is lots of shopping along King Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Georgetown, again, whips Alexandria\u2019s ass, and it\u2019s right across the water in D.C. D.C. has all of the museums\u2014you may have heard of the Smithsonian. D.C. has all of the fine eateries and all of the public transportation, and basically, I mean, put it this way, it\u2019s a fine suburb of D.C. to live in or find a fun and interesting thing to do in the off-the-beaten-path CityPaper. Or, like, to go to a concert at the Birchmere.\n\nYou don\u2019t travel from Montana to Alexandria because of the Birchmere, though. This is like that time some folks out in Fairfax County\u2014another suburb of D.C.\u2014tried to float the idea that Tysons Corner was basically turning D.C. into its suburb. Tysons has exploded. It\u2019s got the biggest mall and the mall with all of the high-end stores. Lots of rich people live out yonder. It\u2019s also far. And in nobody\u2019s world is Tysons Corner a draw to the region.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not judging Money\u2019s survey. OK, I\u2019m lying; I\u2019m totally judging their survey. But I\u2019d truly like to understand how a suburb of an actual destination ranks as the No. 1 spot to travel to when nearly EVERYBODY who would visit Alexandria would most assuredly spend the vast majority of their time in the major city next door that is an international tourist destination. How the hell is the hotel spot a top travel destination in any year? Something is awry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen, I\u2019m not saying anybody with some clout made a call. I do know that way back in time, ads for the Almighty RSO kept showing up in The Source magazine, and nobody could understand why because nobody actually ever listened to the Almighty RSO. Yet, every single month, The Source was telling me I needed to check our their album and even gave them a four-and-a-half-mic rating, back when that shit really mattered.\n\nI don\u2019t know if a Benzino-like character runs Money. What I do know is that every single person who reads this survey and says, \u201cHey, honey, we should check out this Alexandria, Va., place!\u201d is assuredly going to end up finding out it\u2019s next to D.C. and say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we just go to D.C. and check out these places in Alexandria on one of our free days!\u201d\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City and other actual tourist destinations made the list. But somehow Alexandria, Va., residential suburb of Washington, D.C., is the top destination in 2018. A fine city, but the top destination for 2018???? And D.C. isn\u2019t even on the list?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurvey says?

I stayed away because I simply couldn\u2019t get over the fact that my perfect Belle, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a woman so beautiful and charismatic that I imagine little woodland creatures do chores for her simply to be in her presence, was cast as a gotdamn feather duster, while Emma Watson landed the lead role. (Watson is a perfectly capable actress, just #NotMyBelle.)\n\n\n\nLuckily for all of us, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s star has only continued to rise, with British Vogue now hailing her as Britain\u2019s \u201cbreakout star\u201d on its April cover. The 34-year-old actress graces the top fashion magazine looking like a red-velvet dream.\n\nPhoto: Mikael Jansson (Vogue UK/Cond\u00e9 Nast)\n\nMbatha-Raw lands the cover amid a publicity blitz for A Wrinkle in Time, the Ava DuVernay-helmed adaptation of the children\u2019s literary classic of the same name. In the film, Mbatha-Raw plays Dr. Kate Murry, mother to tween Meg Murry (Storm Reid), who embarks on an epic journey to find her father, Alex, played by Chris Pine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a recent Vogue buzz notes, Mbatha-Raw has been \u201cescaping archetypes and quietly shaping a diverse CV for years.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s given riveting performances on both movie and TV screens, playing the title role in the period biopic Belle; showing off her singing skills as a troubled rock star in Beyond the Lights; and taking a time-traveling turn in the iconic, Emmy Award-winning \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode of Black Mirror (which seemed to serve as inspiration for Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s latest video, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d). Mbatha-Raw even manages to be captivating in Netflix\u2019s less-than-stellar recent release, The Cloverfield Paradox.\n\nAnd on the red carpet, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s sartorial growth has been equally impressive. This recent slideshow from Vogue UK tracks Mbatha-Raw\u2019s maturation as she settles into more streamlined, polished shapes with bold colors and textures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt certainly feels like Mbatha-Raw is coming into her moment, though she\u2019s been patiently building her career for decades, starting, as many Brits do, on the stage.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, you have power over your performance, but no power over the distribution or timetable,\u201d she recently told Refinery 29. \u201cSo it just so happens this is all coming out at the same time. But I guess I should embrace the ride!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbatha-Raw also talked about the power of seemingly innocuous beauty choices, like how to wear her hair on-screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to play a woman and not have race be the focus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will always bring who I am to the story and make sure my ethnicity is celebrated on-screen. I\u2019m not afraid to have those tough conversations with directors about how I represent myself. Hair, for instance, sounds like a superficial conversation. But images remain in our subconscious. So when it comes to representing on-screen, I can use my hair to send the important message to girls everywhere that they can be who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: British Vogue\u2019s April issue, featuring Mbatha-Raw\u2019s cover and interview, is available on newsstands Friday, March 9.

I\u2019ve had to wrestle with that, with people going, \u2018You\u2019re too black.\u2019 Then I come to America and they say, \u2018You\u2019re not black enough.\u2019 I go to Uganda, I can\u2019t speak the language. In India, I\u2019m black. In the black community, I\u2019m dark-skinned. In America, I\u2019m British. Bro!\u201d\n\nKaluuya also explained that black people in the United Kingdom also deal with racism and it\u2019s a universal issue, and there are few stories out there that tell of their own experiences.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting singled out for the color of your skin, but not the content of your spirit, and that\u2019s everywhere,\u201d the actor continued. \u201cThat\u2019s my whole life, being seen as \u2018other.\u2019 Not fitting in in Uganda, not Britain, not America.

I have to show off my struggle so that people accept that I\u2019m black.\n\n\u201cNo matter that every single room I go to I\u2019m usually the darkest person there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying? I kind of resent that mentality. I\u2019m just an individual. Just because you\u2019re black, you taken and used to represent something. It mirrors what happens in the film. I resent that I have to prove that I\u2019m black. I don\u2019t know what that is. I\u2019m still processing it.\u201d\n\nJackson later clarified his comments and said that he wasn\u2019t blaming Kaluuya, but the Hollywood system that seemingly shuts out African-American actors in favor of their British counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was not a slam against them, but it was just a comment about how Hollywood works in an interesting sort of way sometimes,\u201d Jackson told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not afforded that same luxury, but that\u2019s fine; we have plenty of opportunities to work,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI enjoy their work,\u201d Jackson said of the British actors. \u201cI enjoy working with them when I have the opportunity to do that.\u201d", "keywords": ["samuel", "outs", "daniel", "darkskinned", "jackson", "africanamerican", "youre", "black", "america", "resent", "prove", "im", "l", "jacksons", "comments", "thats", "kaluuya", "british"], "polarity": 0.030371660859465736, "subjectivity": 0.3781939605110337},

The president was reacting to news on Tuesday that Big Keebler, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, will investigate allegations that the FBI and DOJ bypassed the law in efforts to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants.

The president claimed last year that the Obama administration improperly wiretapped members of his presidential campaign and transition team, though the White House has not provided any evidence to support that claim.

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them? Isn\u2019t that the kind of hard-hitting question a good reporter would want answers to?\n\n\n\nHow about, Why wasn\u2019t the family given any details about Anthony\u2019s death, yet a press conference was held where they went so far as to play the 911 call for the public? That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why. Some of you didn\u2019t even attempt to describe why. At this point, if you need an explanation as to why that happened, you shouldn\u2019t be a reporter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that you don\u2019t know the crisis of police violence in black and brown communities. That deputies consistently get away with killing unarmed black children.

Christopher Bergner replies, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d that that is NOT OK\u2014and it\u2019s also not because he was misheard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only explanation left is that you accept that your job is just a mechanism to uphold white supremacist systems and condone the killing of black children. If you disagree, then do your job\u2014report the truth.\n\nAnd the truth is black grief in its entirety.\n\nHere are a few quick tips to help you get started on your path of true reporting:\n\nInstead of \u201cgang member,\u201d use \u201cchild.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cangry mob,\u201d use \u201cgrieving community.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cchaos,\u201d use \u201ccompletely rational response to the murder of a 16-year-old.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s Department said \u2026 ,\u201d use \u201cthe family and community said \u2026 \u201d\n\nInstead of catering to racists and opportunists, cater to justice and peace for the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some examples of what not to do:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there are further questions\u2014and there should be\u2014reach out directly to the affected family, community or local organizations doing the work.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s that easy. Somehow, POC media is capable of doing that in every story. Perhaps your careless reporting is due to the fact that there is no diversity in your newsroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with the words of Amber Marie, whose 17-year-old nephew Armando Garcia was shot to death by deputies earlier this summer.\n\nThe same LASD rep, Capt. Christopher Bergner, claimed that the deputies were trying to shoot a dog and that the bullets ricocheted off the ground.

Tour the colonial mansion and its four formal gardens, which have been restored to their 18th century appearance. Or rent a car (roughly $40 a day, reports Hipmunk) and explore Virginia\u2019s burgeoning wine country.

But I\u2019d truly like to understand how a suburb of an actual destination ranks as the No. 1 spot to travel to when nearly EVERYBODY who would visit Alexandria would most assuredly spend the vast majority of their time in the major city next door that is an international tourist destination.

Yet, every single month, The Source was telling me I needed to check our their album and even gave them a four-and-a-half-mic rating, back when that shit really mattered.\n\nI don\u2019t know if a Benzino-like character runs Money. What I do know is that every single person who reads this survey and says, \u201cHey, honey, we should check out this Alexandria, Va., place!\u201d is assuredly going to end up finding out it\u2019s next to D.C. and say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we just go to D.C. and check out these places in Alexandria on one of our free days!\u201d\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City and other actual tourist destinations made the list. But somehow Alexandria, Va., residential suburb of Washington, D.C., is the top destination in 2018. A fine city, but the top destination for 2018????

Jackson has some thoughts about black British actors securing American roles instead of African Americans, suggesting that perhaps black Americans could add some authenticity, especially when dealing with culturally specific things like America\u2019s struggles with interracial relationships.\n\n\n\nDuring an interview Monday with Hot 97 while promoting his newest film, Kong: Skull Island, Jackson cited films such as the most recent crowd fave, Get Out, which features British actor Daniel Kaluuya as a black American going to visit his white girlfriend, only to find some insidious racist, scary crap going down (still trying not to give any spoilers, although I suspect everyone has seen it by now).\n\nAt any rate, Jackson seemingly questioned how much more authentic the film would have been if a black American had been able to play Kaluuya\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cI know the young brother who\u2019s in the movie, and he\u2019s British,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere are a lot of black British actors that work in this country. All the time. I tend to wonder what would that movie have been with an American brother who really understands that in a way. Because Daniel grew up in a country where they\u2019ve been interracial dating for a hundred years. Britain, there\u2019s only about eight real white people left in Britain \u2026 what would a brother from America have made of that role? I\u2019m sure the director helped. Some things are universal, but everything ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen probed further about the phenomenon of black British actors playing African Americans, Jackson mused: \u201cThey don\u2019t cost as much. Unless you\u2019re an unknown brother that they\u2019re finding somewhere. They think they\u2019re better-trained, for some reason, than we are because they\u2019re classically trained. I don\u2019t know what the love affair is with all that. It\u2019s all good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson went on to add: \u201cEverybody needs to work, but there are a lot of brothers here that need to work, too. They come here because there are more opportunities, and they actually get paid when they work here. Which is fine.\u201d\n\nBritish actor John Boyega, who famously played Finn in Star Wars: Episode VII\u2014The Force Awakens, jumped in on Twitter, tweeting that \u201cblack brits vs African American\u201d was a \u201cstupid ass conflict\u201d that nobody has time for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson later came back to defend his commentary, but insisted that \u201cit was not a slam against [black British actors].\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just a comment about how Hollywood works in an interesting sort of way sometimes,\u201d he clarified to the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re not afforded that same luxury, but that\u2019s fine; we have plenty of opportunities to work \u2026 I enjoy their work ... I enjoy working with them when I have the opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think?

Why should you care about this? Well, Rybka also claims to be able to connect all of the dots missing from the Russia investigation and President Donald J. Trump. Rybka was recently arrested and thrown into a Thai jail and now, most likely because she\u2019s been arrested and cut off from her Russian money source, she\u2019s ready to spill all the tea.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am ready to tell you about all those jigsaw puzzles you were missing, to support it with audio, video, regarding the connection between our \u2018dear\u2019 parliament members with [former Trump campaign manager Paul] Manafort, Trump and all this \u2018buzz\u2019 around the election in the USA,\u201d said Rybka, who appeared to be riding around in a caged vehicle, USA Today reports. \u201cI know a lot. Therefore, I shall wait for your offers, and I wait in the Thai prison.\u201d\n\nWait, I\u2019m completely confused. Rybka is locked up in a Thai prison and is riding around in a caged vehicle, most likely a prison-transport vehicle, but she still has her phone and access to her Instagram account?\n\nAlso, instead of asking for help, she\u2019s offering to sell her story to whoever can get her out of prison. If it weren\u2019t for this divisive administration and this backward-ass president, I would chalk up Rybka\u2019s missive as the desperate pleas of a Russian thot, but I hate this administration so much, I am tempted to start a GoFundMe account in her honor. Oh, and then there is this:\n\n\u201cIf we go back to Russia we will die in Russian\u2019s prison or they will kill us,\u201d she wrote Tuesday on her Instagram account. \u201cPlease USA help us not to die from Russians!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRybka was arrested along with nine other Russians who claimed to be sex experts running a course on lovemaking, which I guess is illegal in Thailand.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Deripaska was a business associate of former Trump campaign manager Manafort and hired him starting in 2006 to influence American politics to benefit Russia. The contract stipulated $10 million a year for Manafort\u2019s services.\n\nWhile Rybka could have the goods to sink this torturous administration\u2019s bootleg dingy, Rybka also admits to making shit up from time to time, USA Today reports. But she has provided receipts to back up part of her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how USA Today recounts bits of her memoir, Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, in which she writes about galavanting with top Russian officials, a tome that\u2019s been cited by Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin:\n\nNavalny used Rybka\u2019s memoir Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, her social media postings and geolocation techniques to show that she spent time in August 2016 on Deripaska\u2019s yacht off the coast of Norway. She had claimed in her book that the cruise was off the coast of Greenland. Photos on her Instagram account, @natya_rybka.ru, showed her on the navy blue, teak-decked Elden with Deripaska. They also showed Deripaska there with Sergei Prikhodko, who\u2019s described on the Russian government\u2019s website as deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeripaska posted a statement to Instagram on Feb. 9 claiming that he\u2019s never done anything wrong and plans to defend his \u201chonor and dignity\u201d in court.

According to the Washington Post, in an article titled, \u201cAlexandria, Va., Outranks Home of Disneyland as Top Place to Go in 2018, Survey Says\u201d:\n\n[Money] magazine said in a description of its rankings called \u201cThe 20 Best Places to Go in 2018\u201d that it looked at locations internationally and in the United States that \u201cdeliver the highest value for your dollar.\u201d It also gives tips on what it considers \u201cmust-do experiences and amenities,\u201d and it claims that its suggestions are a deal and even a \u201csteal.\u201d For U.S. travel, Money ranked Alexandria, Va., in first place.\n\nHmm.\n\nAccording to Money:\n\nTo truly experience the Old Town neighborhood, grab an outdoor table at Hank\u2019s Oyster Bar during happy hour on a Friday night. Hank\u2019s is one of dozens of cafes, boutique shops and galleries that line the walkable mile of King Street that ends at the historic wharf. Art lovers should check out the nearby Torpedo Factory Art Center, a space housing 82 artist studios and seven galleries, featuring everything from pottery to stained glass. On the other end of town stands the legendary Birchmere Music Hall, where greats like Johnny Cash and Dave Matthews once played. Alexandria is also the perfect jumping off point to explore George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon estate ($20 for adults), says Evan Godt, a Lonely Planet destination editor for the Americas. Tour the colonial mansion and its four formal gardens, which have been restored to their 18th century appearance. Or rent a car (roughly $40 a day, reports Hipmunk) and explore Virginia\u2019s burgeoning wine country. A little over an hour away, you\u2019ll find RdV Vineyards (tours, $65 per person), which is known for its cult-status red blends.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, I like Alexandria. I literally go there every single day when I drop my daughter off for school. I like Old Town just fine, and if I were a (multi) millionaire, I\u2019d buy a house in Alexandria. Floods a bit much for my taste, but ya know, you can\u2019t win them all. But Alexandria is not a tourist destination\u2014not from out of town.\n\nIt\u2019s barely a destination for people who live in D.C. In almost no universe are people paying money to venture specifically to Alexandria. You come to D.C. and then go to Alexandria because the site you on where you booked your hotel made it seem like the hotel was \u201cright outside of Washington, D.C., with views of the Capitol at night!\u201d\n\nNearly every single thing you can do in Alexandria, you can do in D.C., and it ain\u2019t THAT much more expensive. The article mentions cobblestone streets. Georgetown got those. It mentions Alexandria as a jumping-off point for George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon plantation Estate, which is not even in Alexandria. You have to drive THROUGH Alexandria to get there. Again, Old Town is cool ... it\u2019s very quaint. I enjoy going down there on infrequent occasions and watching street performers along the river, and there is lots of shopping along King Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Georgetown, again, whips Alexandria\u2019s ass, and it\u2019s right across the water in D.C. D.C. has all of the museums\u2014you may have heard of the Smithsonian. D.C. has all of the fine eateries and all of the public transportation, and basically, I mean, put it this way, it\u2019s a fine suburb of D.C. to live in or find a fun and interesting thing to do in the off-the-beaten-path CityPaper. Or, like, to go to a concert at the Birchmere.\n\nYou don\u2019t travel from Montana to Alexandria because of the Birchmere, though. This is like that time some folks out in Fairfax County\u2014another suburb of D.C.\u2014tried to float the idea that Tysons Corner was basically turning D.C. into its suburb. Tysons has exploded. It\u2019s got the biggest mall and the mall with all of the high-end stores. Lots of rich people live out yonder. It\u2019s also far.

The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too.

It is just a good description. But wiretapping was in quotes.

I stayed away because I simply couldn\u2019t get over the fact that my perfect Belle, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a woman so beautiful and charismatic that I imagine little woodland creatures do chores for her simply to be in her presence, was cast as a gotdamn feather duster, while Emma Watson landed the lead role.

That\u2019s why I've decided to just tackle the core of the issue: Why don\u2019t we all just act more like White people?\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. White people are privy to some of the greatest things in America \u2014 ironic tattoos, ironic racist jokes, and ironic bars, to name just a few \u2014 and I can certainly see why they\u2019d be so baffled about everyone else\u2019s refusal to just do the shit they do.

Whether it\u2019s Kristin in Ghana taking pictures of the kids she\u2019s teaching African dance, or Sage back on the homefront snapping an Instagram of the little brown girl drawing chalk outlines on the sidewalk, White people really enjoy giving small kids the gift of an internet presence they and their parents have no way of knowing about or controlling. Why? Well, let's see.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret White people greatly enjoy proclaiming their lack of prejudice. It\u2019s like breathing for them, and it\u2019s certainly far easier than actually not being racist. And what better way to posture than to take pictures of children who are not White? \u201cHey,\u201d White people probably say. \u201cThis picture of schoolkids in Harlem eating free breakfast would totally make a great performance art piece!\u201d\n\nWhite Culture Anthropologist Biff Chiply explains that the picture is like a rite of passage for Whites, who must venture into territory unknown when they come of age. Whether this involves going into another country, or going into the slightly-less-gentrified part of their neighborhood, White people must take this journey and are not allowed to rejoin their own without a picture of an indigenous child for proof.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo begin the ritual, they often put on a war costume of elaborate khaki shorts and flip-flops. During their journey, they pray to the pantheon of Whiteness by doing elaborate yoga poses in odd places in order to channel the spirit of Gwyneth Paltrow to the space. Then, after finding some way to offer unsolicited help to those around them and spread their energy further, they take a picture to immortalize the impact they\u2019ve made. As volunteer trips are often impractical and unsustainable, this is hugely necessary; otherwise, there would be no sign that they had helped at all. Or worse, clear evidence that they had somehow made things worse.\n\n\u201cYou have to help the children learn how to learn,\u201d said Skylar, a White tutor who told us that he had to explain to the children he works with what a \u201cgenderless name\u201d is. \u201cIf only they could do that, they could really understand what life is like beyond the rainbow, and like, what else do you need?

This, even though more whites are dependent on public assistance and living at or below the poverty line\u2014defined by the U.S. government as an income of \u201c$12,195.00 for a family of four\u201d (a figure I\u2019m urged by Taylor to both memorize and write down).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor\u2019s belief is that the root of poverty is education inequality. \u201cI left Essence when I found out that some 8 percent of black fourth-graders were reading below grade level,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s a tragic reality that affects our community in ways we wouldn\u2019t expect. \u201cYou get an all-white police force when the schools are broken\u2014there\u2019s no pool to recruit officers from,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to dismantle poverty by making sure that everyone who wants to work can be paid a living wage. That, and making sure that education is not directly tied to property taxes.\u201d\n\nVoting rights present another major issue: \u201cRedistricting and closing down voting sites by not allowing people to vote in their churches after service on Sundays. And putting up barriers so that young people, older people, people of color will not be able to vote\u2014and they\u2019ve done it successfully,\u201d Taylor explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGerrymandering has worked,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe Moral Mondays Movement led by our honoree Dr. William Barber II, the former head of the NAACP who stepped down, and now he\u2019s leading the Poor People\u2019s [Campaign] in North Carolina, which is a model for what needs to happen around the country.\u201d\n\nTaylor also reminds me that as black women, we have to continue to use our power at the polls.\n\nCourtesy of National Cares Mentoring via YouTube\n\nDo Business With Companies That Frame Women Appropriately\n\nTaylor says we also need to buy products and services from companies that have women on their boards and women in leadership positions within the corporation. The recent sale of Essence to Liberian entrepreneur Richelieu Dennis grants the publication\u2019s top employees\u2014most of whom are women\u2014equity in the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI want to see this not just at Essence magazine; I would like to see this happening across the board. We don\u2019t own anything in our communities.\u201d\n\nGive Wisely\n\nRegarding the nonprofit world, while we often give to major charities like the Red Cross, Taylor cautions, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the sisters and brothers who are boots on the ground in our community; who are really doing work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have money and skills that are sorely needed right on our own corner.\n\nOne in 6 Americans is food-insecure, a statistic that this children\u2019s-rights activist finds stunning, given that, she says, \u201cthere are invitations to eat everywhere you look in this country\u2014yet our children grow hungry.\u201d\n\nHunger is a major impediment to learning, and in a country as resource-rich as America, it\u2019s a sin for any of us to let that go unremedied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLearn to Really Love Ourselves Again\n\nHarry Belafonte\u2014a part of Taylor\u2019s \u201cbrain trust\u201d\u2014told her: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to fix what our children are contending with unless we are aware.\u201d\n\nTurning her efforts toward the parents of our at-risk children, Taylor has developed a framework in her book A New Way Forward: Healing What\u2019s Hurting Black America. The 32-week curriculum wrestles with the impact of centuries of enslavement on our psyches, like indoctrinated hatred of our blackness, our Motherland, our hair textures, our lips and our hips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a depression that we all have; a self-denial that\u2019s rarely named or recognized,\u201d Taylor says, with a sadness in her voice that quickly gives way to protest. \u201cHealth disparities are stunning when you look at how unhealthy African Americans are\u2014not just poor black folk. It\u2019s across the board ... African Americans need to build ourselves up so that we can stand strong in love and unity; repair our own lives, so we can repair our villages.\u201d", "keywords": ["taylor", "women", "susan", "wants", "love", "legendary", "living", "save", "children", "major", "black", "spirit", "community", "poverty", "essence", "movement"], "polarity": 0.1428137192026081, "subjectivity": 0.4201815331444961},

It\u2019s headline read:\n\n\u201cThis is What Bae Means.\u201d\n\nYes, stupid stories happen. Stupid headlines even more frequently. But TIME Magazine, once a premier weekly magazine (the first of its kind, actually), made space for 500 words under the protection of its elite-level masthead to write about the word \"bae\". And I have so many questions about how this story came about. Was it pitched? Was it assigned? I\u2019ve asked all these questions via Twitter to the piece\u2019s author, Katy Steinmetz. I\u2019m awaiting a response.\n\nSteinmetz, who also wrote the cover-story feature on Laverne Cox in May, now has a byline in TIME Magazine for writing about the word \u201cbae.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\nReally, this is Pharrell\u2019s fault. Because that fucking \u201cHappy\u201d song. Because between their fascination with \u201cBlack Twitter\u201d and the fact that Miley Cyrus won\u2019t go quietly into the night, white folks\u2019 predilection for minding the business of other cultures is totally aroused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps most frustrating about this piece is the fact that its written as just another flash in the pan, pop culture moment, complete with know-nothing ass Google charts that are supposed to make readers believe they are part of something. It's cool. It's trendy. Not at all rooted in the way that people have addressed each other for generations. Bae is \u201cslang that Pharrell likes enough to put in the titles of his songs.\u201d\n\nFun!\n\nNevermind the fact that my parents have been calling each other \u201cbae\u201d since long before I was ever a thought. Or that Black southern grandmas use it to pass their love on to their grandbabies. TIME Magazine (of all places, SMH) is passing out \u201cprimers\u201d on cool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack cool.\n\nAsk any cool person and they\u2019ll tell you that cool can\u2019t be explained. Cool either is or it isn\u2019t, and trying to explain it, even being asked about it aloud, makes a thing decidedly less so. ?uestlove said (in another TIME Magazine headline, no less) that \u201cBlack people have to come to grips that hip-hop is a contagious culture,\u201d and I agree. But Blackness ain\u2019t.\n\nBlackness as performance sho\u2019 is profitable, though. Internet clicks. Units, moved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy issue isn\u2019t with Pharrell (at least, not in this particular instance) but with journalism\u2019s internet culture. The internet has done two things: (A) Lowered barriers to entry into professional journalism, which in turn produces a lot of terrible content masquerading as \u201cinnovative,\u201d \u201cinteresting,\u201d or \u201cthought-provoking,\u201d or \u201cwell-written\u201d and (B); busted the door wide open for the Culture Vulture\u2019s favorite pastime: An Inside Look At the Secret Life of Negroes.\n\nIf you\u2019re even remotely entertaining or can turn a phrase on Twitter, you\u2019ve experienced this first hand. My tweets have been jacked by Esquire (as the lede to somebody\u2019s story on Brooklyn\u2019s gentrification, no less) Buzzfeed, and some other places, with no ask made and no permission granted.\n\nHaving traveled abroad, it\u2019s my belief that the primary export of \u201cBlack America\u201d is cultural \u2014 music, song, dance, style, art, writing, and the list goes on. It is how we are identifiable in the world. Even traveling as far as South Africa, someone wanted to talk to me about \u201cJigga.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because our culture is our output, it should be ours to protect, to profit from \u2014 hell, to write about! There are lots of complicated (and often unproductive) conversations about the ownership of culture. Of language. Movement. Dance. Last week, TIME (gotdamnit) ran a story that responded to University of Mississippi senior Sierra Mannie\u2019s essay about the co-opting of Black female culture.\n\n\u201cBlack people can\u2019t have anything,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNot doobie wraps. Not the Nae Nae. I am bored, people of the journalism community. Bored with these lazy-ass pieces that try to explain the idiosyncrasies of my household, my experience, and my fucking existence. Bored with the microscopic lenses that exoticize Black love and Black expression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, I'm timing my watch to see how long it takes white folks to find out about the jar of cooking grease on the back of the stove.\n\nMaya K.

When we returned to the area where our families were, the women that I thought would become very angry when they saw what he had tried to do\u2014I had almost taken his eye out so everyone would know\u2014when I saw their faces, they didn\u2019t want to say that they knew.

The performer Josephine Premice Fales. She was from a community that is all about being Haitian and black. That gives women such pride.

In 2014, Gallagher used electric shocks to punish defendant Terry Lee Morris, on trial for soliciting a sexual performance from a 15-year-old-girl, when Morris refused to answer the judge\u2019s questions properly. In total, Gallagher shocked Morris three times, \u201csending thousands of volts coursing through his body,\u201d the Post reports. Each shock lasts about eight seconds and releases a 50,000-volt shock into the defendant\u2019s body.\n\nThe shocks so deeply scarred Morris that he refused to return for the remainder of his criminal trial. He also missed almost all of his sentencing hearing.\n\nNow the Texas 8th Court of Appeals in El Paso has thrown out Morris\u2019 conviction, finding that the shocks violated his constitutional rights. The ruling was made on Feb. 28 and was recently reported in the Texas Lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was coercing behavior in such a violent manner wrong, but because Morris was too scared to return to court after being shocked, that \u201ceffectively barred him from attending his own trial,\u201d reports the Post, which violated his Sixth Amendment rights to be present and confront witnesses during his trial.\n\nIn the court\u2019s opinion, Justice Yvonne T. Rodriguez wrote: \u201cWhile the trial court\u2019s frustration with an obstreperous defendant is understandable, the judge\u2019s disproportionate response is not. We do not believe that trial judges can use stun belts to enforce decorum.\n\n\u201cA stun belt is a device meant to ensure physical safety; it is not an operant conditioning collar meant to punish a defendant until he obeys a judge\u2019s whim,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis court cannot sit idly by and say nothing when a judge turns a court of law into a Skinner Box, electrocuting a defendant until he provides the judge with behavior he likes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post also gave a detailed description of the interactions that prompted Judge Gallagher to stun Morris in the first place. The punishment was sparked over a dispute during Morris\u2019 plea entry.\n\nThis is what happened after Gallagher asked Morris how he would like to plead, from the Post:\n\n\u201cSir, before I say that, I have the right to make a defense,\u201d Morris responded. He had recently filed a federal lawsuit against his defense attorney and against Gallagher, whom he wanted recused from the case. As Morris continued talking, Gallagher warned him to stop making \u201coutbursts.\u201d \u201cMr. Morris, I am giving you one warning,\u201d Gallagher said outside the presence of the jury, according to the appeals court. \u201cYou will not make any additional outbursts like that, because two things will happen. No. 1, I will either remove you from the courtroom or I will use the shock belt on you.\u201d \u201cAll right, sir,\u201d Morris said. The judge continued: \u201cNow, are you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cSir, I\u2019ve asked you to recuse yourself,\u201d said Morris. Gallagher asked again: \u201cAre you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cI have a lawsuit pending against you,\u201d responded Morris. \u201cHit him,\u201d Gallagher said to the bailiff. The bailiff pressed the button that shocks Morris, and then Gallagher asked him again whether he is going to behave. Morris told Gallagher he had a history of mental illness. \u201cHit him again,\u201d the judge ordered. Morris protested that he was being \u201ctortured\u201d just for seeking the recusal. Gallagher asked the bailiff, \u201cWould you hit him again?\u201d\n\nThe crime Morris was convicted of is certainly heinous\u2014there\u2019s no arguing that. But Morris, like everyone else, is due a fair trial. There are also other ways to punish someone like Morris for being uncooperative without having to resort to literally stunning them with electricity like a dog.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGallagher\u2019s cruel punishment also prolongs the process for the victim and her family, who now have to go through a new trial now that Morris\u2019 conviction will be thrown out (a new trial has been ordered by the appellate court).\n\n\u201cNever before have we seen any behavior like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behavior again,\u201d Justice Rodriguez wrote in her decision, adding that the courts are obligated to speak out against such actions, \u201clest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\u201d\n\nGallagher, in case you were wondering, is still a judge, and declined to offer a comment to the Post on the story, citing judicial ethics.", "keywords": ["used", "morris", "court", "shock", "gallagher", "cooperate", "post", "force", "judge", "trial", "electric", "asked", "report", "defendant", "texas", "shocks", "stun"], "polarity": 0.0061431989063567925, "subjectivity": 0.5446001367053999},

But since there are no movie theaters in Compton, Disney helped set up the screening at a community center, converting it into a pop-up theater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuVernay also took to Instagram to share photos and thanks from the screening, including a thank-you to Compton\u2019s mayor, Aja Brown, and the city for \u201cwelcoming [her] home so warmly.\u201d\n\nThe film is based on the classic 1962 children\u2019s novel by Madeleine L\u2019Engle, which centers on a tween girl, Meg (Storm Reid), who searches the universe for her missing father, a physicist (Chris Pine).

It was Naomi\u2014yes, that Naomi\u2014my comrade-in-arms in the supermodel game, and my little sister by way of our adopted father, the recently departed French designer Azzedine Ala\u00efa.\n\n\u201cVeronica,\u201d she said, in that throaty British accent that hugs every syllable like a Maserati taking a curve. \u201cTime to go to London to honor Papa.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cPapa,\u201d of course, she meant Azzedine, and by \u201cLondon,\u201d she meant the 2017 British Fashion Awards, which happened on Monday, Dec. 4. And in the brief two weeks between that call and the event, the women who loved Azzedine and whom he loved landed, like a flock of rare birds, in London\u2019s stunning art-deco-inspired Dorchester Hotel to prep for the British Fashion Awards ceremony Monday night.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, I jumped off my red-eye from New York and\u2014still wearing my OnePiece onesie\u2014straight into the brilliant hands of makeup legend Pat McGrath. McGrath, who was also honored that night with the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator for her extraordinary work as a makeup artist and entrepreneur of her eponymous makeup line, had volunteered her time for the day, as had 10 other models from Azzedine\u2019s devoted cadre of muses. All of us were there to be photographed for British Vogue, at the behest of Naomi, who is now a contributing editor. The resulting editorial will run in the February issue, in honor of what would have been Azzedine\u2019s 78th birthday.\n\nStylist Joe McKenna, who made a wonderful film on Azzedine, pulled together an amazing retrospective of Azzedine\u2019s collections for us to wear to the ceremony, and\u2014ever the filmmaker\u2014hit FaceTime on his phone so we could share the moment with people across the globe who were important to the Ala\u00efa family, like members of Azzedine\u2019s staff and, of course, Azzedine\u2019s life partner of 53 years, the painter Christoph von Weyhe. The only thing louder than the blow-dryers was the sound of our laughter, and the only thing tighter than our ponytails were the hugs we were giving one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith eyes, lips and cheeks painted for the gods (using McGrath\u2019s Mothership II Subversive eye shadow palette in hues of azure, amethyst and gold), we took our places in front of a seamless black velvet backdrop, ringed with enough lights to light up Yankee Stadium. Photographer Nick Knight, a longtime collaborator of British Vogue\u2019s new editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, gave us a single direction for the photos: to celebrate Azzedine\u2019s life.\n\nOver the next hour, Knight captured us: women who loved the clothes we were wearing as much we did the man who made them\u2014along with many of our careers. Farida Khelfa, the French-Algerian model who was one of Azzedine\u2019s original muses, stunned us all in a vintage 1988 Ala\u00efa evening dress as elegant as a ball gown but as easy as a T-shirt, making it more relevant than ever today in our athleisure era. Atop it was a bad-ass leopard cape from Azzedine\u2019s current collection. Every model was eyeing it, including me.\n\nThe new generation, Moroccan-Egyptian model Imaan Hamman, who hails from Holland, and New York-born Dominican Dilone, were respectively gorgeous in a long fitted macram\u00e9 tank dress and a short black velvet page-boy-inspired tunic dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy dress for the evening was a confection of black cotton layers cut with origami precision, held together by a single string threaded through a complex hidden tunnel of seams, finally closing with a discreet bow. Laughing and hugging one another and wiping away the inevitable tears, we wrapped the set and piled into the four Mercedes vans waiting to take us to the ceremony at the world-famous Royal Albert Hall.\n\nAnd what an incredible site that was! The staircase had to be 50 feet wide and three stories high, with a red carpet draping downstairs from the venue on high all the way to the street below. P!nk was making her entrance with designer Stella McCartney as Team Azzedine stopped to pose for the thick throng of paparazzi stationed outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInside the hall, we crowded into Naomi\u2019s dressing room, reminiscing about the times Azzedine played tricks on us, scaring us half to death, and the many times we felt he\u2019d saved our lives by teaching us how to handle a life situation\u2014or literally, like when Naomi was attacked by thieves in Paris in 2012. Azzedine put his 5-foot-4, 72-year-old self between her and harm\u2019s way.\n\nWe played the songs that reminded us of him: Tina Turner\u2014he designed her costumes and learned all of her dance routines (he could dance his ass off)\u2014and \u201cAddicted to Love,\u201d by Robert Palmer, one of the sexiest videos in the \u201980s, featuring a girl \u201cband\u201d dressed in Ala\u00efa. He didn\u2019t even know the video was happening until we caught it on MTV while we were working late one night in his studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Champagne giggles and couture karaoke fest were interrupted by the stage manager knocking at the door. Waiting in the wings, we listened to designer Virgil Abloh accepting the award for Off-White as Urban Luxe Brand of the year. Naomi turned to me as we were waiting and said, \u201cYou know no other black designer has ever won a BFA before?!\u201d A mixture of pride and relief at Abloh\u2019s victory quickly gave way to disgust flashing across her gorgeous face. \u201cShould I say something about that?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cSay \u2018congratulations,\u2019\u201d I answered. We both nodded, knowing that this moment was about Azzedine. And we would keep pushing our way into the industry for ourselves and others every day, just as he had done for us.\n\nWe stepped onstage 10 strong, passing mics from one to another, remembering our Azzedine to the audience that included Model of the Year Adwoa Aboah, Donatella Versace and FKA Twigs. You could have heard a pin drop in the concert hall. We said our piece and exited stage left to resounding applause, reaching the greenroom just in time to watch Pat McGrath accept her award on the monitor backstage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ceremony over, with everyone still on a high from all the many wins for black Britons that night, it was time to party. Naomi\u2019s mom, Valerie, had a 66th birthday to celebrate, wearing a tux that showed off her tight, slender figure and drop-dead-gorgeous diamond Bulgari snake necklace over a black satin pointed-collar shirt. Like mother like daughter, Naomi\u2019s mom was letting you have it on the fashion tip.\n\nWe rolled to Cipriani in the heart of Mayfair for a celebration dinner. Candles blown out and most of us booked on 6 a.m. flights, the desire for sleep couldn\u2019t overwhelm the desire to make the most of our time with friends. So we hit the club at Chitwhins Firehouse, where Edward Enninful was hosting the after-party for Off-White. He welcomed us all with open arms from his corner perch with fellow Brit model Jourdan Dunn and songwriter Gerry Deveaux. Behind the DJ booth, menswear designer Ozwald Boateng danced with Marpessa Hennink, global director of haute couture at Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe toasted Naomi for reuniting us and putting the Azzedine tribute together. \u201cYou want to stay a little longer?\u201d I asked, the clock already pushing 2:15.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d she answered, a big smile spreading across her face. \u201cI\u2019m going home to New York tomorrow, and my 17 pieces of luggage are already packed.\u201d\n\nLike all of us there, I\u2019m sure her bags were packed full of Ala\u00efa, each article of clothing a symbol of a beautiful life spent together.", "keywords": ["empire", "awards", "gold", "azzedines", "fashion", "way", "black", "azzedine", "team", "model", "british", "designer", "takes", "ceremony", "naomi", "strikes"], "polarity": 0.14985024938829292, "subjectivity": 0.4882706725641507},

White guy leads rebellion of poor whites and runaway blacks in the Civil War? I expected another white-savior movie where the hero gets the post-racial bonus prize of the black girlfriend or wife for his efforts. Did seeing the film change my initial apprehensions? Yes and no.\n\nFree State of Jones is a good, but not great, film. It does an excellent job of laying out an amazing true story and offers some excellent acting and a few interesting action scenes. Most importantly, it succeeds at giving black folks some agency in their own liberation. Unfortunately, the movie lacks the courage to depict the complexities and contradictions that made this incredible Civil War rebellion possible.\n\nFree State of Jones drops you into 1862 during a bloody battle between Union and Confederate soldiers in Mississippi. Newt Knight, a Confederate solider (played by Matthew McConaughey), works feverishly as a field nurse, patching together what\u2019s left of soldiers in a battle field caked in blood. Director Garry Ross doesn\u2019t cheat you with voice-overs, some Basil Exposition character or an opening crawl. Instead, Free State of Jones organically lays out the reasons that drive Newt to his eventual rebellion against the Confederacy.\n\nThe Civil War Is \u201ca Rich Man\u2019s War and a Poor Man\u2019s Fight\u201d\n\nThe catalyst for the Knight rebellion is a combination of class and race that simmers under the surface of every interaction in the film. First, the \u201c20 Negro Rule\u201d was passed by the Confederacy, exempting the eldest sons of families with 20 or more slaves (i.e., rich folks) from military service. (Up North, rich people used the Enrollment Act of 1863, under which you could pay someone to take your place in the Army. Lincoln actually used this.) Second, the farmers in the South were being routinely raided for supplies by the Confederacy, meaning that many conscripted soldiers returned home to find that their wives and children were destitute or, worse, had died of starvation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFed up with the Civil War and fearing for the safety of his newborn son and wife, Serena (played by Keri Russell), Newt goes home and starts a ruckus. He trains women to fight off Confederate troops, which makes him a deserter and an outlaw. Serena, who was not about that outlaw-wife life, flees Jones County. Newt starts a rebel army in the swamps with the help of other Confederate deserters, house slave Rachel (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and runaway slave Moses (Mahershala Ali).\n\n\u201cCaptain Knight\u201d gives his rebels some incredibly rousing classic McConaughey speeches about how poor whites and blacks are both \u201cn\u2014gers\u201d and face similar oppression. It\u2019s a seductive message for today\u2019s audience, almost like a Bernie Sanders rally on income inequality. However, the film fails to make it clear exactly where Newton Knight\u2019s beliefs stem from. Is he a Civil War-era Tyler Durden, just looking out for the little guy? Or is he a hot-headed libertarian who wants to be left alone? Free State of Jones never fully explores those questions. This despite the fact that the film covers Newt Knight\u2019s legacy from the battlefield, to the Reconstruction ballot box, all the way up to the Mississippi Supreme Court in the 1950s. It\u2019s an ambitious story that falls just short of greatness.\n\nMaybe Knight Was Progressive by 1860s Standards; Not So Much by Today\u2019s\n\nNo period piece can cover everything. Events are streamlined, composite characters are created and timelines are fudged (although, to its credit, Free State of Jones has an accompanying website, which included historical footnotes). Consequently, Free State of Jones teaches us about Newt\u2019s character and politics mostly through his romantic relationships. Free State wants us to see Newt Knight as a progressive man on gender; he trains women to defend themselves and allows his \"first\" wife and son to return to the family farm even after he\u2019s taken up with Rachel as his common-law wife and had a child with her. We are also to believe he is a racially progressive man, teaching Rachel to read and ceding his land to her because he could not legally marry a black woman. Relative to other men at the time, Newt Knight wasn\u2019t just progressive, he was radical, but that isn\u2019t close to the complete story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is that Rachel wasn\u2019t just any slave woman. She was owned by Knight\u2019s father and bore children by his brother and possibly his father before he wifed her. Also, while Newt did take on a black wife, a scandalous act at the time, his sense of ownership over black women\u2019s bodies wasn\u2019t that far out of step with the times. He began a sexual relationship with Rachel\u2019s eldest daughter (who was possibly his niece) and had children by both.\n\nIt is true that Newt allowed his wife and son to come back to the family farm (a key element in a side story that takes his legacy up to a 1950s court case). However, he treated all the women under his charge like a typical slave owner. He continued to have sexual relations with his first wife, Rachel and Rachel\u2019s daughter, and forced many of his children to intermarry to keep their skin light.\n\nIf Free State of Jones did not spend so much time reminding us what a great guy Newt Knight was through his relationships, his marital peculiarities wouldn\u2019t matter. But it did, and they do. Showing the audience that Newt Knight was a bigoted, inbred Mississippi bigamist by our 2016 standards would have in no way diminished how radical and progressive he was in 1867. The movie\u2019s failure to do so cheapens what is otherwise a painstakingly accurate film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Johnson, political editor at The Root, is a professor of political science at Morgan State\u2019s School of Global Journalism and Communication and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera International, Fox Business News and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

In 2014, Gallagher used electric shocks to punish defendant Terry Lee Morris, on trial for soliciting a sexual performance from a 15-year-old-girl, when Morris refused to answer the judge\u2019s questions properly. In total, Gallagher shocked Morris three times, \u201csending thousands of volts coursing through his body,\u201d the Post reports. Each shock lasts about eight seconds and releases a 50,000-volt shock into the defendant\u2019s body.\n\nThe shocks so deeply scarred Morris that he refused to return for the remainder of his criminal trial. He also missed almost all of his sentencing hearing.\n\nNow the Texas 8th Court of Appeals in El Paso has thrown out Morris\u2019 conviction, finding that the shocks violated his constitutional rights. The ruling was made on Feb. 28 and was recently reported in the Texas Lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was coercing behavior in such a violent manner wrong, but because Morris was too scared to return to court after being shocked, that \u201ceffectively barred him from attending his own trial,\u201d reports the Post, which violated his Sixth Amendment rights to be present and confront witnesses during his trial.\n\nIn the court\u2019s opinion, Justice Yvonne T. Rodriguez wrote: \u201cWhile the trial court\u2019s frustration with an obstreperous defendant is understandable, the judge\u2019s disproportionate response is not. We do not believe that trial judges can use stun belts to enforce decorum.\n\n\u201cA stun belt is a device meant to ensure physical safety; it is not an operant conditioning collar meant to punish a defendant until he obeys a judge\u2019s whim,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis court cannot sit idly by and say nothing when a judge turns a court of law into a Skinner Box, electrocuting a defendant until he provides the judge with behavior he likes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post also gave a detailed description of the interactions that prompted Judge Gallagher to stun Morris in the first place. The punishment was sparked over a dispute during Morris\u2019 plea entry.\n\nThis is what happened after Gallagher asked Morris how he would like to plead, from the Post:\n\n\u201cSir, before I say that, I have the right to make a defense,\u201d Morris responded. He had recently filed a federal lawsuit against his defense attorney and against Gallagher, whom he wanted recused from the case. As Morris continued talking, Gallagher warned him to stop making \u201coutbursts.\u201d \u201cMr. Morris, I am giving you one warning,\u201d Gallagher said outside the presence of the jury, according to the appeals court. \u201cYou will not make any additional outbursts like that, because two things will happen. No. 1, I will either remove you from the courtroom or I will use the shock belt on you.\u201d \u201cAll right, sir,\u201d Morris said. The judge continued: \u201cNow, are you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cSir, I\u2019ve asked you to recuse yourself,\u201d said Morris. Gallagher asked again: \u201cAre you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cI have a lawsuit pending against you,\u201d responded Morris. \u201cHit him,\u201d Gallagher said to the bailiff. The bailiff pressed the button that shocks Morris, and then Gallagher asked him again whether he is going to behave. Morris told Gallagher he had a history of mental illness. \u201cHit him again,\u201d the judge ordered. Morris protested that he was being \u201ctortured\u201d just for seeking the recusal. Gallagher asked the bailiff, \u201cWould you hit him again?\u201d\n\nThe crime Morris was convicted of is certainly heinous\u2014there\u2019s no arguing that. But Morris, like everyone else, is due a fair trial. There are also other ways to punish someone like Morris for being uncooperative without having to resort to literally stunning them with electricity like a dog.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGallagher\u2019s cruel punishment also prolongs the process for the victim and her family, who now have to go through a new trial now that Morris\u2019 conviction will be thrown out (a new trial has been ordered by the appellate court).\n\n\u201cNever before have we seen any behavior like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behavior again,\u201d Justice Rodriguez wrote in her decision, adding that the courts are obligated to speak out against such actions, \u201clest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\u201d\n\nGallagher, in case you were wondering, is still a judge, and declined to offer a comment to the Post on the story, citing judicial ethics.", "keywords": ["used", "morris", "court", "shock", "gallagher", "cooperate", "post", "force", "judge", "trial", "electric", "asked", "report", "defendant", "texas", "shocks", "stun"], "polarity": 0.0061431989063567925, "subjectivity": 0.5446001367053999},

Earlier today, [ICIJ Director Gerald] Ryle announced the consortium is splitting off from the Center for Public Integrity in a move intended to give his team more room for financial growth.\n\nIn announcing its award, Daily News Co-Chairman & Co-Publisher Eric Gertler said, \u201cThis Pulitzer prize awarded today to the Daily News and ProPublica is not only high recognition of the tenacity and talent of Sarah Ryley but also a reflection of the importance of collaboration in today\u2019s competitive news environment as well as the first-rate editorial leadership here at the newspaper and the high quality of journalism that the entire editorial team produces every day for our readers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProPublica explained, \u201cThe series of articles by Sarah Ryley detailed a little-known NYPD practice \u2014 lawsuits that allow police to ban people from their homes or businesses, without due process, under claims that they are being used for illegal purposes. The measure was initially conceived to push out the sex industry from Times Square.\n\n\u201cIn her initial analysis Ryley spotted the alarming trend of residents who were not convicted of crimes, and who were even cleared of their charges, but removed from their homes anyway. The cases, roughly 1,000 in New York City each year, happened almost exclusively in communities of color.\n\n\u201cThen a data projects editor and investigative reporter at the New York Daily News, Ryley had been looking into nuisance abatement laws for more than a year, while juggling other responsibilities. To allow for the kind of long-term, in-depth reporting and data work that the story demanded, Ryley joined forces with ProPublica.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProPublica provided three researchers who helped perform the time-consuming work of going through every nuisance abatement case filed in the previous year and a half \u2014 1,162 in total \u2014 tracking every major step of the process, cross-referencing hundreds of cases with parallel proceedings in criminal court and the State Liquor Authority, and entering the details into spreadsheets.\n\n\u201cA ProPublica photographer, fluent in Spanish, assisted with the project\u2019s extensive fieldwork \u2014 not only documenting the faces of families and business owners targeted by nuisance abatement actions, but also helping interview victims in largely Spanish-speaking communities such as the South Bronx and East Harlem.\n\n\u201cProPublica editors worked with Ryley to develop and structure the pieces, which were the first long-form stories of her journalism career. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe photographer, Edwin Torres, wrote on Facebook, \u201cMost of my work involved photographing and street reporting on the families whose homes were raided or were evicted or business owners whose shops were shut down. Going door to door in the projects and section 8 housing. Days seemed to go on forever...Access was not easy. I was blessed to spend my days with Sarah Ryley, the journalist, whose original idea it was to investigate and crack the code.

Apparently distraught over an impending divorce, he hanged himself with a bedsheet.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2014 election, the Washoe County jail went five years without a single inmate suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince then, the suicide rate has skyrocketed, a Reno Gazette-Journal investigation found. The spike in deaths happened as the jail stopped providing annual suicide prevention training.\n\n\u201cSince Jan. 1, 2015, six inmates have committed suicide at the Washoe County Jail. In the eight years prior to that, only one inmate succeeded in hanging himself.\n\n\u201cThe suicides are just one aspect of a spiking death rate at the jail since Sheriff Chuck Allen took over. Thirteen people have died in the last two years \u2014 including three who died while being restrained by deputies, one who died when a baggie of meth burst in his digestive track two weeks after he was booked into the jail and a woman who died in the infirmary while detoxing from heroin.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

The punishment was sparked over a dispute during Morris\u2019 plea entry.\n\nThis is what happened after Gallagher asked Morris how he would like to plead, from the Post:\n\n\u201cSir, before I say that, I have the right to make a defense,\u201d Morris responded. He had recently filed a federal lawsuit against his defense attorney and against Gallagher, whom he wanted recused from the case. As Morris continued talking, Gallagher warned him to stop making \u201coutbursts.\u201d \u201cMr. Morris, I am giving you one warning,\u201d Gallagher said outside the presence of the jury, according to the appeals court. \u201cYou will not make any additional outbursts like that, because two things will happen. No. 1, I will either remove you from the courtroom or I will use the shock belt on you.\u201d \u201cAll right, sir,\u201d Morris said. The judge continued: \u201cNow, are you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cSir, I\u2019ve asked you to recuse yourself,\u201d said Morris. Gallagher asked again: \u201cAre you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cI have a lawsuit pending against you,\u201d responded Morris. \u201cHit him,\u201d Gallagher said to the bailiff. The bailiff pressed the button that shocks Morris, and then Gallagher asked him again whether he is going to behave. Morris told Gallagher he had a history of mental illness. \u201cHit him again,\u201d the judge ordered. Morris protested that he was being \u201ctortured\u201d just for seeking the recusal. Gallagher asked the bailiff, \u201cWould you hit him again?\u201d\n\nThe crime Morris was convicted of is certainly heinous\u2014there\u2019s no arguing that. But Morris, like everyone else, is due a fair trial. There are also other ways to punish someone like Morris for being uncooperative without having to resort to literally stunning them with electricity like a dog.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGallagher\u2019s cruel punishment also prolongs the process for the victim and her family, who now have to go through a new trial now that Morris\u2019 conviction will be thrown out (a new trial has been ordered by the appellate court).\n\n\u201cNever before have we seen any behavior like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behavior again,\u201d Justice Rodriguez wrote in her decision, adding that the courts are obligated to speak out against such actions, \u201clest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\u201d\n\nGallagher, in case you were wondering, is still a judge, and declined to offer a comment to the Post on the story, citing judicial ethics.", "keywords": ["used", "morris", "court", "shock", "gallagher", "cooperate", "post", "force", "judge", "trial", "electric", "asked", "report", "defendant", "texas", "shocks", "stun"], "polarity": 0.0061431989063567925, "subjectivity": 0.5446001367053999},

According to the Chronicle, the 36-year-old Brown later sued a slew of Harris County officials, including the DA\u2019s office, the prosecutor and the police officer who handled the murder case, accusing them of hiding and falsifying evidence against him and violating his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n\nThe new email, which came to light because of Brown\u2019s lawsuit, backs up his claims, showing that the prosecutor at the time, Dan Rizzo, was aware of evidence that could have exculpated Brown.\n\nSome necessary context: Brown was accused and convicted of killing a Houston police officer and a store clerk during a robbery at a check-cashing store. But Brown maintained that there was no way he could have done the crime because he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house at the time of the murders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he could prove that he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house, Brown said, because he had placed a call to her at work from her house phone at the time of the murders. But as the Chronicle reports, for years, officials claimed that they had no record of such a call.\n\nThat changed in 2014, when an investigator, Breck McDaniel, found phone records in his garage that supported Brown\u2019s alibi. The discovery was enough to overturn Brown\u2019s conviction. At the time, the Chronicle writes, the DA claimed that the phone records had simply been \u201cinadvertently misplaced.\u201d\n\nThe newly released email refutes that claim. A day after Brown\u2019s girlfriend testified before a grand jury that Brown had called her from her apartment, McDaniel wrote to then-prosecutor Rizzo about the phone records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Chronicle:\n\n\u201cI was hoping that it would clearly refute Erica\u2019s claim that she received a call at work,\u201d McDaniel wrote, later continuing: \u201cBut, it looks like the call detail records from the apartment shows that the home phone dialed Erica\u2019s place of employment on Hartwick Street at about 8:30 a.m. and again at 10:08 a.m.\u201d\n\nRizzo didn\u2019t share the evidence with Brown\u2019s legal team or the jury\u2014a clear Brady violation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn light of the evidence, Brown\u2019s lawyers want the current Harris County DA, Ogg, to formally declare their client \u201cactually innocent\u201d\u2014a label that would allow Brown to get compensation from the state for his wrongful conviction.\n\nAfter his overturned sentence in 2015, Brown petitioned the state for nearly $2 million in compensation for the years he spent on death row, but the request was denied by state officials because he hadn\u2019t met the eligibility requirement, since Brown was never found \u201cactually innocent.\u201d\n\nThat phrase ended up pushing Brown to sue Harris County officials for their denial of his due process rights. The civil lawsuit has certainly borne fruit; without it, the email would never have come out, and the public wouldn\u2019t know not only that Brown was telling the truth the whole time, but also that the real criminals may actually be the Harris County DA\u2019s office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVindication,\u201d tweeted Brian Stolarz, one of Brown\u2019s attorneys when he appealed his criminal case.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly now, after a civil lawsuit, does the whole truth finally come out,\u201d Stolarz added in a statement, according to the Chronicle. \u201cI am sickened and disheartened, but encouraged that Dewayne is vindicated and his long journey to justice is near the end.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["innocent", "harris", "phone", "death", "county", "officials", "landing", "brown", "man", "email", "prosecutor", "prevented", "withheld", "report", "row", "texas", "evidence", "browns", "chronicle"], "polarity": 0.08897649969078543, "subjectivity": 0.46915069057926184},

As the Sacramento Bee defines it, personal recognizance bond \u201callows defendants be released from jail before standing trial without having to pay cash bail.\u201d\n\nMcSpadden also made it very clear to whom he was denying bail. From the Chronicle:\n\n\u201cThe young black men - and it\u2019s primarily young black men rather than young black women - charged with felony offenses, they\u2019re not getting good advice from their parents,\u201d he said. \u201cWho do they get advice from? Rag-tag organizations like Black Lives Matter, which tell you, \u2018Resist police,\u2019 which is the worst thing in the world you could tell a young black man ...

As the Houston Chronicle reported, Councilman Michael Kubosh, who is also a bail bondsman, said that McSpadden refused to appoint lawyers to low-income clients who were free on bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpadden\u2019s policy was to require most defendants free on bail to hire their own lawyer. If they did not, he ordered them to come to court daily until a lawyer was hired. McSpadden\u2019s rationale was cartoonishly simple: If you can make bail, you can afford a lawyer; underprivileged clients who asked for court-appointed attorneys were regularly denied them by McSpadden.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be this hard,\u201d Kubosh told the Chronicle at the time. \u201cThey do this to oppress the person to take a plea or give up and just make a deal.

With no action necessary from people who were convicted, 3,038 misdemeanor convictions will be dismissed and sealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, NPR reports, prosecutors will review nearly 5,000 additional felony convictions to see if they can be reduced to misdemeanors.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the dismissals will happen automatically, requiring no effort on the part of those with marijuana-related offenses on their records to expunge those convictions themselves. Gasc\u00f3n, in a statement, noted that although petitioning to have these records cleared has been in place in San Francisco, the process is costly and can require legal help. It was noted that only 23 such petitions were filed in the last year.\n\nThe decision will disproportionately affect the city\u2019s black and Latinx residents, who\u2019ve been arrested at far greater rates than their white peers throughout the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NPR, which cites numbers from the district attorney\u2019s office, San Francisco\u2019s black residents made up just 7.8 percent of the city\u2019s population but made up 41 percent of marijuana-related arrests in 2000. A decade later, even though the percentage of black people living in San Francisco dropped (to 6 percent), they made up an even greater share of marijuana-related arrests, at nearly 50 percent.\n\nThat number was even worse than California\u2019s statewide average.

Will there be justice for McKnight?\n\nGasser, 56, is accused of gunning down 28-year-old McKnight after a \u201cmutual road rage\u201d car chase during which they allegedly gave each other the finger and called each other names. Gasser\u2019s trial for second-degree murder began Friday. He pleaded not guilty and claimed that the shooting was in self-defense.\n\nOn Monday the jury watched a videotaped interview that took place between detectives and Gasser just one day after he fatally shot McKnight. Gasser told detectives that he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle, and McKnight was on the passenger side with his hands and upper torso \u201cprimarily in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nIn a prior interview, Gasser had said that he shot McKnight after McKnight made an aggressive lunge toward him. Physical evidence showed that McKnight was not as close as Gasser claimed he was when the shooting occurred, but will that make a difference to the jury?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Aviva Shen points out for In Justice Today, Jefferson Parish\u2014Louisiana\u2019s largest county and also where the trial is taking place\u2014faced accusations of racism immediately following the Dec. 1, 2016, shooting. Although Gasser confessed to shooting McKnight three times in broad daylight, he was initially released without any charges by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThen-Sheriff Newell Normand claimed in a Dec. 6, 2016, news conference that race wasn\u2019t a factor in the case, then proceeded to read from messages full of expletives and racial slurs that he said had been directed at him and other officials as a result of their handling of the case.\n\nThis is the same Jefferson Parish where former Sheriff Harry Lee said in 2006: \u201cWe know the crime is in the black community. Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["help", "nfl", "white", "jury", "woman", "justice", "mcknight", "shooting", "black", "player", "jefferson", "joe", "gasser", "parish", "juror"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547},

Blige at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles\u2014Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z accidentally teased a joint tour. Bey\u2019s Facebook and Ticketmaster pages revealed a concert date for a previously unannounced stadium stint: Monday, July 30, at Philadelphia\u2019s Lincoln Financial Field. Press caught it, her team deleted it and we never thought about it again ... until Tuesday, when two anonymous sources confirmed to Billboard that the tour is definitely real, but Bey can\u2019t talk about it because of Coachella.\n\nHmmm.\n\n\n\nOne of the aforementioned two sources told the pub, and I quote, \u201cA hold for the tour had been placed at a number of North American stadiums.\u201d This is exciting, to say the least: The last time a Jay-Bey tour happened was in 2014, their infamous On the Run Tour. It\u2019s been two new albums (J\u2019s 4:44 and B\u2019s Lemonade) and four years since, and I\u2019m hungry for more, goddamn it.\n\nSo why can\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z spit out the good news and ease our troubled minds? Coachella might really be to blame\u2014Bey is headlining the festival this year, performing on Saturday night both weekends of the Indio, Calif., event: April 14 and 21.\n\nHistorically, Coachella\u2019s parent company, Goldenvoice, has required its big talent to hold off on any tour announcements until after the event, which makes sense: If I\u2019m only trying to see Bey and a few other acts, it\u2019s much, much, much cheaper to wait until she comes near me, and I get to avoid Coachella, which seems unbearable. Win-win, y\u2019all.\n\nIf she (and her husband, lest we forget) waited until the Monday following the end of Coachella, April 22, as Billboard points out, they\u2019d still have 98 days to announce, sell tickets and market the Philadelphia show.

The departmental also confirmed that it will be examining its policy on texts that are allowed, as well as \u201call current lists of banned written materials.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, even though at least two prisons in the state had the book on the no-go list, the Department of Corrections noted that the book was used by the New Jersey Scholarship and Transformative Education Program, which gives inmates the opportunity to enroll in college-level courses, citing that as one of the reasons the ban was lifted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOfficials determined that the book should not have been banned, as evidenced by the fact that it is being utilized as a teaching tool for NJ-STEP students.\u201d New Jersey Department of Corrections spokesperson Matthew Schuman told the Times.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA lot of things look funny in the light, and when prisons ban a critically acclaimed book about the discrimination black people face in the criminal-justice system ... well, that\u2019s more than a little funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, according to The Guardian, that\u2019s exactly what is happening in some prisons in New Jersey, which have reportedly banned Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness .\n\nRecords obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union through a public-records request show that the book, which was published in 2010, is on lists of publications inmates in state facilities may not possess.

In Ohio, accomplices to murder can receive the same punishment as the actual killers, according to the Dayton Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last time she had set foot in her neighborhood was as a teenage girl.

According to the Daily News, that robbery\u2014over a necklace\u2014opened her up to the aggravated-murder conviction.\n\nNow, thanks to a public campaign for her exoneration that brought in celebrities, politicians and the victim\u2019s own sister, Patterson is free\u2014though not exonerated. In fact, Michelle\u2019s sister, Hollie Lai Holbrook, who was with her when she was killed, may have been the key to Patterson\u2019s freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Dayton Daily News reports, Patterson was one of five people charged for the murder of Michelle and the robbery of Hollie Lai Holbrook and three other girls. According to court records, Michelle\u2019s group had been out \u201crogueing\u201d\u2014stealing from garages\u2014that day when they ran into Patterson\u2019s group, which included Michelle\u2019s killer, LaShawna Keeney.\n\nA Guardian article from 2016 lays out the complexities of the case.\n\nPatterson says that Dayton police forced her to admit that she had robbed a necklace from one of the girls\u2014an act that would make her an active participant in the violent crimes committed against Michelle and her sister and friends. But Patterson never actually did so, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that Hollie Lai Holbrook, one of the victims, had claimed that Patterson was innocent as well.\n\nLast year, Lai Holbrook told The Guardian that, when Dayton police arrived at the scene of the crime, she singled out Patterson as someone who had nothing to do with her sister\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cI remember pointing someone out that night and saying to the police: \u2018She didn\u2019t do it, she didn\u2019t have anything to do with it\u2019; that kept going around my head over and over again,\u201d Lai Holbrook told the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Holbrook, who was 18 at the time of her sister\u2019s death, even provided a detailed description of Patterson: \u201cShe was biracial; dark, long hair. I recall she had a coat on, a fluffy coat,\u201d she recalled telling police.\n\nBut police convinced Lai Holbrook to believe that Patterson was involved after telling her that Patterson had confessed to robbing one of the girls.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the only way the state failed Patterson. As The Guardian recounts, not only was she forced to make a false admission to law enforcement, but the courts failed her, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Guardian:\n\nPatterson was inadequately represented at trial, with her defense attorney at the time telling the Guardian that his handling of the case was in his view the lowest point of his career as a lawyer. The defense team dissuaded Patterson from going into the witness box because she \u201cspoke too hood\u201d ... The trial defense team also decided to withhold from the jury a tape recording of a 911 call Patterson made to emergency workers soon after the murder happened. Six of the 12 members of the jury have given affidavits saying that if they had known about the 911 call they would have found her not guilty.\n\nA juror on the case who felt strongly that Patterson was innocent also told the paper that she had \u201ccaved in\u201d to a guilty verdict after being told that it was late and that \u201ca fellow juror was pregnant and needed to go home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Holbrook, who wrote a letter to Ohio Gov. John Kasick last year advocating for Patterson\u2019s exoneration, said that family pressure and trauma led her to bury her doubts about Patterson\u2019s conviction for years.\n\n\u201cI knew I was wrong. But I didn\u2019t want to be the black sheep of the family, the odd one out, and I didn\u2019t want to have to relive that night; I just wanted it buried,\u201d Lai Holbrook admitted to The Guardian.\n\n\u201cWhen the police offered us little hints and pieces of information, it made it easier for me to overlook what really happened that night. The prosecutors were intimidating,\u201d Lai Holbrook added. \u201cNot just to me, to all of us. They were just scary. It seemed like they pushed the fact that all these girls did what they did, and that there was a confession.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Christmas Day, Patterson and her family credited Lai Holbrook with reuniting them at last.\n\n\u201cHolly Lai is a hero, and she has been an advocate for me,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nPatterson, a sixth-grade dropout, will now work for the Ohio Justice and Policy Center in Cincinnati.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do great things,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of people in prison who are innocent.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Dayton Daily News.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story said Tyra Patterson had been exonerated.

Bleak because the country\u2019s top public health organization is now prohibited from using the term \u201cscience-based.\u201d Bleak because we\u2019re surprised that a man accused of sexually harassing and assaulting young girls\u2014and who extols slavery\u2014lost an election. Bleak because the president of these United States stood in front of a portrait of former President Andrew Jackson and made a joke about Pocahontas while \u201chonoring\u201d Navajo code talkers. Bleak because all of these developments happened within the past month alone.\n\n\n\nThe criminal-justice system took a hard beating this year \u2014especially at the federal level. The Department of Justice\u2019s head honcho, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directed all federal prosecutors (pdf) to seek the harshest charges possible in every criminal case, scaled back police department investigations, bolstered civil asset forfeiture, put military-grade weapons back in the hands of local police and expanded the federal government\u2019s role in immigration enforcement. Important crime statistics \u2014 including arrest data \u2014 were stripped from the FBI\u2019s annual crime report, which is typically used to assess national trends and develop potential solutions. Police officers are still getting away with killing unarmed civilians.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this year was one of the worst in recent memory. But what if I told you that there\u2019s reason to hope \u2014 that there is still some good to latch on to?\n\n\n\nWell, there is. Here are 11 criminal-justice victories to prove it.\n\n\n\n1. New York and North Carolina \u201craised the age.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists, juvenile-justice experts and courts agree that kids and teenagers are different from adults. The part of the brain associated with decision-making is still underdeveloped, which renders them immature, reckless and impulsive. They are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, including family dynamics, trauma and income instability. But children across the country are still being prosecuted as adults in federal and local courts \u2014 sometimes automatically, sometimes at the discretion of a prosecutor or judge.\n\nThis year, New York and North Carolina passed legislation to \u201craise the age\u201d and will no longer automatically prosecute 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Instead, these teenagers can legally be processed in the juvenile-justice system, which is better equipped to assess and tackle young people\u2019s unique needs, and aims to be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\n\n\n2. The Senate passed critical juvenile-justice legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWay back in 1974, the federal government passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, agreeing that there should be a basic set of guidelines for approaching incarcerated youths. As outlined by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, there were four major tenets of the legislation: Youths shouldn\u2019t be locked up with adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for offenses that wouldn\u2019t be considered crimes if committed by adults, and there are racial disparities among detained youths that need to be reduced. With these ideas in mind, the JJDPA gave the federal government an opportunity to create a path for states and municipalities to follow \u2014 and fund them accordingly. But Congress has failed to reauthorize and update it since 2002.\n\n\n\nIn August, the Senate finally voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the legislation, after passage of a sister bill in the House last year. Now that both houses of Congress have advanced legislation, they will hold a conference committee to consolidate the bills and send a final version to the president. But the fact that Congress is addressing JJDPA at all, after 15 years, counts as a victory.\n\n3. Some juvenile lifers were released from prisons.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Supreme Court has ruled, twice, that sentencing juveniles to life without parole is unconstitutional. In accordance with these rulings, many states have agreed to eliminate the harsh sentence, resentence those locked up before the landmark decisions and put parole back on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as Jessica Pishko wrote in The Nation, it is remarkably difficult for convicted lifers to get out of prison. Some prosecutors just push for another life sentence or another lengthy sentence, with parole as an option down the line. Waiting for a parole board to review a case can take years, and release comes with a major condition that people who claim innocence have to grapple with: an acknowledgment that they are responsible for the crime for which they\u2019ve spent a lifetime behind bars.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some have made it out. There\u2019s Bobby Hines, who, at age 15, was sentenced to life without parole in Michigan for his connection to a murder. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but has spent the last 28 years behind bars because prosecutors said he was responsible for the killing. There\u2019s Earl Rice Jr., who was 17 at the time he was locked up in a Pennsylvania prison for a robbery gone wrong. Rice has spent the past 43 years in prison because a woman he stole a purse from fell to the ground and fatally hit her head. There\u2019s also Giovanni Reid in Pennsylvania, who was found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a murder when he was 16. While the numbers are still small, these three count among dozens given another chance by the Supreme Court and states acknowledging that kids are kids.\n\n\n\n4. Thousands of convictions were dropped because of lab scandals in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Annie Dookhan served as a drug-lab chemist, helping prosecutors build thousands of cases in Massachusetts. But by her own admission, she tampered with evidence, wrote false reports, failed to complete vital drug tests and lied about her credentials. In April, prosecutors decided to drop over 21,000 cases tied to Dookhan \u2014 many of which were prosecuted in Boston \u2014 rather than spend countless dollars and resources to retry all of them.\n\n\n\nIn November, prosecutors dismissed another 6,000 cases because of chemist Sonja Farak\u2019s illegal activity in another crime lab. In addition to tampering with evidence, Farak stole and used drugs from a lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and conducted most of her work over eight years while high.\n\n\n\n5. Louisiana passed a comprehensive reform package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana has long been known as the incarceration capital of the world. In 2014 it had the highest incarceration rate, with nearly 40,000 people behind bars. Now there are about 36,000. As the state mulled over ways to fix this bleak reality, I was lucky to be one of many people to testify before the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee about mass incarceration\u2019s disastrous impact on the population \u2014 and the whopping price tag that comes with it. In June, the legislature finally did something about the problem, passing a massive reform package to reduce the prison population by 10 percent in 10 years at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe package includes a number of sentencing and parole reforms. Mandatory minimums were gutted for various offenses: theft, arson, drug possession and others. Judges now have more discretion to sentence violent offenders and repeat offenders. Prosecutors have more discretion to send people to diversion programs as an alternative to prison. There are no more automatic parole terms for low-level offenses, and judges can now shorten probation terms for some violent offenders and repeat offenders.\n\n\n\n6. A progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia won the election by a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Democratic candidate Larry Krasner not only won the race to become Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney, but he won close to 75 percent of the vote. Krasner, who once called himself \u201ccompletely unelectable,\u201d has long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement. He notoriously sued Philadelphia officers for breaching civil rights 75 times. He has also spent much of his decadeslong career fighting for activists who have been criminalized by the government.\n\nHis platform was also one of the most progressive ones to date. He promised to end death penalty sentences, the prosecution of cases that involve stop-and-frisk, civil asset forfeiture and cash bail for nonviolent offenses. He vowed to treat addiction as a public health problem, to prosecute police engaged in misconduct and to protect immigrants.\n\nWith their overwhelming support, local voters declared that reform is necessary in the city with the highest incarceration rate among the 10 largest U.S. cities and rampant police abuse. The victory also continued a slow but growing national trend of prosecutorial candidates running on platforms to rethink and scale back tough-on-crime policies that have contributed to the bloated carceral population.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. New York City announced a plan to close Rikers Island.\n\nNew York City is famous for jailing thousands of criminal defendants pretrial\u2014the vast majority of whom can\u2019t afford bail \u2014 at Rikers Island. There, they face extreme violence and the rampant use of solitary confinement. Medical neglect is the norm. Many prisoners have been driven to suicide. The air is toxic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the facility will be shuttered over the next 10 years and replaced with a smaller jail in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. The decision was a response to recommendations made by the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, which was assembled in 2016 at the urging of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. At the time of the announcement, roughly 9,360 people were detained at the facility.\n\n\n\n8. There are more eyes on prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers are easy to scrutinize for many reasons. They are the most public-facing law enforcement officials, and there is no shortage of stories about how they racially profile people, prey on marginalized groups, violate basic constitutional rights and kill. By and large, they get away with these behaviors. Considering all of this, it makes sense that activists, reporters and lawmakers have been critical of policing and have pushed for reform. But there\u2019s another group of law enforcement officials who deserve the same amount of scrutiny: local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nUnlike federal prosecutors operating under Jeff Sessions, prosecutors at the state, county and city levels have the discretion to file charges, request bail and fines and fees, establish plea deals and push for harsh sentences. While this is nothing new, more and more people are starting to understand the profound role that prosecutors play in driving mass incarceration.\n\nThe ACLU of California launched a campaign to educate voters about their local district attorneys and the policies they promote \u2014 including those that contradict what voters actually want. Journalists have also produced deep dives on prosecutors\u2019 abuses of power and misconduct, including Brady violations, the presentation of false evidence, questionable remarks made to jurors and a total lack of accountability. More eyes on these officials ultimately means that there can be a bigger push for accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Use of the death penalty is still on the decline.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks national execution and death penalty sentencing, there were 23 executions this year. This marks the second-lowest number of executions in the past 25 years, and the continuation of a downward trend that\u2019s lasted nearly two decades. The total number of new death sentences, 39, was historically low as well, marking the second-lowest number of new death sentences in any year since 1972. Public support for the death penalty is also the lowest it has been since that year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese trends can be attributed to a better understanding of how flawed cases can be because of science, juror bias and shady prosecutor behavior. Executions themselves are rife with problems, including but not limited to the fact that the drugs used to execute people are manufactured in unregulated pharmacies and don\u2019t work. The costs associated with the appeals process, detention and the execution process are also astronomical.\n\n\n\n10. Poor drivers in California got some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time when motorists in the Golden State could have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended because they were too poor to pay traffic fines. This put them in a classic \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. Many people in this position still needed to drive to jobs where they earned what little money they had, at the risk of getting pulled over and accruing more tickets and fines that couldn\u2019t be paid. They still had to take kids to school. Some caught driving with a suspended license were jailed.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that put a stop to these license suspensions. The legislation will also be applied retroactively. This month, Alameda County became one of the first to reverse the suspensions in accordance with the new law \u2014 a move expected to affect 54,000 drivers.\n\n\n\n11. Multiple programs are helping formerly incarcerated people rebuild.\n\nRelease from prison can be incredibly complicated. On one hand, people get their freedom back. On the other hand, former prisoners often have no money, home or support system in place to truly get back on their feet. A criminal record can also prevent them from accessing social services that they would otherwise qualify for, and hurt their chances of securing a job or getting a college degree. Buying a bus ticket can be impossible. All of these obstacles perpetuate the cycle of poverty and incarceration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more and more programs are starting to offer vital assistance upon re-entry, and this year was full of success stories. For instance, my campaign to end mass incarceration, FREEAMERICA, helped to launch Unlocked Futures. The project will fund, offer guidance to and promote new entrepreneurial ventures by people who were once locked up.\n\nIn Los Angeles, formerly incarcerated individuals have been hired for construction jobs and given an opportunity to build up their own communities. In fact, re-entry grants for health care, treatment programs and educational programming have been awarded throughout California. In Louisiana, criminal-justice advocates established a comprehensive re-entry plan to address the needs of people impacted by the criminal-justice overhaul.\n\n\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nJohn Legend is a 10-time Grammy Award winner, an Academy and Tony Award winner, a philanthropist and the founder of the #FreeAmerica campaign.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarimah Townes is a criminal-justice reporter for the Fair Punishment Project.

Blige at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles\u2014Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z accidentally teased a joint tour. Bey\u2019s Facebook and Ticketmaster pages revealed a concert date for a previously unannounced stadium stint: Monday, July 30, at Philadelphia\u2019s Lincoln Financial Field. Press caught it, her team deleted it and we never thought about it again ... until Tuesday, when two anonymous sources confirmed to Billboard that the tour is definitely real, but Bey can\u2019t talk about it because of Coachella.\n\nHmmm.\n\n\n\nOne of the aforementioned two sources told the pub, and I quote, \u201cA hold for the tour had been placed at a number of North American stadiums.\u201d This is exciting, to say the least: The last time a Jay-Bey tour happened was in 2014, their infamous On the Run Tour. It\u2019s been two new albums (J\u2019s 4:44 and B\u2019s Lemonade) and four years since, and I\u2019m hungry for more, goddamn it.\n\nSo why can\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z spit out the good news and ease our troubled minds? Coachella might really be to blame\u2014Bey is headlining the festival this year, performing on Saturday night both weekends of the Indio, Calif., event: April 14 and 21.\n\nHistorically, Coachella\u2019s parent company, Goldenvoice, has required its big talent to hold off on any tour announcements until after the event, which makes sense: If I\u2019m only trying to see Bey and a few other acts, it\u2019s much, much, much cheaper to wait until she comes near me, and I get to avoid Coachella, which seems unbearable. Win-win, y\u2019all.\n\nIf she (and her husband, lest we forget) waited until the Monday following the end of Coachella, April 22, as Billboard points out, they\u2019d still have 98 days to announce, sell tickets and market the Philadelphia show. That\u2019s a lot less lead time than other tours of this size, but they could be prepping for it right this very second, so who knows?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, they probably don\u2019t need to make the same preparations as other artists, so let \u2019em do whatever they want\u2014as long as we get the tour.

He has spent more than 50 Christmases there, but he thought this year might be different. The parole board was set to hear his case for release, but on the day of the hearing, the board delayed it.\n\nIn 1963, when John F. Kennedy was president, a judge sentenced the then 17-year-old Montgomery to life without parole. America is the only place in the world where prosecutors regularly try kids as adults and request that kids be sentenced to die behind bars with no hope of freedom.\n\nBut Montgomery now has a second chance, thanks to a string of rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2012 the Supreme Court recognized that kids are different from adults. They have underdeveloped brains, impairing judgment and impulse control, and are more susceptible to negative influences and peer pressure. Unsurprisingly, those who make their way into the criminal-justice system are often themselves victims (pdf) of physical abuse, sexual abuse, extreme poverty and trauma at elevated levels.\n\nBecause of these differences, the Supreme Court eliminated life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than murder, and severely limited it for kids charged with murder, ruling that only the \u201cirreparably corrupt\u201d can receive a juvenile life-without-parole sentence. And in 2016, in Henry Montgomery\u2019s appeal, the court made that decision retroactive.\n\nMontgomery is now one of the more than 2,100 \u201cjuvenile lifers\u201d in America\u2019s prisons waiting to plead their case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the sentence prevails, especially in Michigan\u2014where we\u2019ve all lived and either played sports or coached. While 19 states and the District of Columbia have formally eliminated juvenile life without parole, and while prosecutors in most states almost never seek it, district attorneys in Michigan, Louisiana and a few isolated pockets are leading the charge to keep kids behind bars. Forever.\n\nTake Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit. As of July of 2016 (pdf), Wayne County had more than 150 people with juvenile life-without-parole sentences\u2014the second highest in the country. Ninety percent of those kids are black, even though black people make up just 39 percent of the population. The elected prosecutor, Kym Worthy, has pushed to maintain the original life sentence in nearly 40 percent of cases of juvenile life without parole, even though the Supreme Court has said that only the rare kid should qualify. Jessica Cooper, the elected prosecutor in nearby Oakland County, Mich., is asking for death behind bars in almost 90 percent of the proceedings.\n\nDuring our recent Detroit listen-and-learn tour focused on juvenile justice, several of us heard moving stories about those juvenile lifers who have now been given a second chance. We met Edward Sanders, who at 17 was sentenced to life without parole for participating in a drive-by shooting even though he was not the shooter. His accomplishments behind bars are remarkable. He served on a Michigan committee to help improve relations between prison staff and inmates. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree, took a paralegal course and served as a resident jailhouse lawyer, helping other inmates with their pleadings. He even taught classes. And in July of this year, after more than 40 years in prison, he was resentenced and paroled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there are hundreds of people like Sanders who are no longer a danger to society and have something to contribute. Like Sanders, they should be given an opportunity to show they have changed and earn their release.\n\nWhen prosecutors like those in Michigan ask to maintain juvenile life-without-parole sentences, they are saying that people who received lengthy sentences as kids should not have the opportunity to plead their cases to a parole board even after serving decades for their crimes\u2014no matter how changed or how successful they have been in classes or programs. That\u2019s a startling claim to make about a kid who committed a crime before he or she could vote, order a drink, join the military or, for some, drive a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese prosecutors are simply refusing to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. That should change. They should let individuals convicted as children plead their cases to a parole board after spending decades in prison, exercising empathy instead of relying on overly harsh juvenile sentences. State legislators can also pass legislation to end juvenile life without parole. We place trust in our elected officials to follow the law and do the right thing, but they are failing us. We call on our elected leaders to stop betraying the public trust and to end juvenile life without parole forever.\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nStan Van Gundy is head coach of the Detroit Pistons.

Of course you are! The current administration\u2019s steady commitment to incompetence, corruption and white nationalists has gotten the American people, especially African Americans, riled up in ways not seen since Chaka Khan performed at the Republican National Convention (yes, that happened). We at The Root really feel for you, and offer a solution to your pain: our new ongoing series, On the Run: 2017 Campaign Edition.\n\n\n\nSeveral times a month, we\u2019ll be taking you on a tour throughout the U.S., focusing on African-American candidates running for local office, the statehouse and Senate, mayor or governor ... in other words, the people who have just as much to do with your health care and security as the golf-playing, TV-watching retiree in the White House. These are local races where you can volunteer, give money, support and vent your Donald Trump-induced frustrations at the ballot box this fall. We also want you to participate in the process; this is an ongoing interactive story, so if you\u2019re running for local office or know someone who is, tweet us here or here and we may reach out to you.\n\n\n\nOur first feature takes us to Virginia, which, according to the state\u2019s motto, \u201cis for lovers\u201d (of all kinds, legally). Justin Fairfax is a 38-year-old attorney and graduate of Duke University running for the Democratic nomination June 13 to be lieutenant governor of Virginia. He is currently leading in some straw polls, and if successful this fall, he would be one of only a handful of African Americans ever to serve as lieutenant governor in the United States, not to mention the only African American to hold statewide office in Virginia this year. We talked to Fairfax about his upbringing, his view on politics and why he just can\u2019t stay loyal to one major league team.\n\nThe Root: Justin, I think you were made in a lab by Democratic scientists looking to make the perfect black candidate for the DMV (Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia metro area). You come from the Midwest (Pittsburgh), but you grew up in Northeast D.C. during the worst part of the crack epidemic in the late \u201980s and \u201990s. You were raised by a single mom who managed to send four kids to college, and you graduated from Duke undergrad, then Columbia Law School. And your last name is Fairfax, which just happens to be the most populous and diverse county in the state. How do we know you\u2019re for real?!\n\nJustin Fairfax: [Laughter.] Well, I\u2019m real. [Laughter.] I mean, my motivation for running for office is to pay back a spiritual debt. Growing up, we didn\u2019t have a lot of money. People gave us hope and faith and optimism and a high-quality education. No matter how dark things seemed, that spiritual wealth kept us going. I have a spiritual debt to pay to all those people\u2014my mom, grandparents, neighbors\u2014who poured so much into me. I have to make that story possible for other people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You grew up in Northeast D.C., which used to be a poor and working-class black neighborhood. Now almost nobody can afford to live there. The same thing is happening in Northern Virginia, where the Great Recession and the housing crisis wiped out so much black wealth that almost nobody can afford to buy Grandma\u2019s old row house and flip it for a million dollars. What is your stance on gentrification?\n\nJF: It is a huge challenge, and one thing that I\u2019m passionate about. My mom saved up enough money to buy the house across the street from my grandparents, and she still lives there today in Northeast D.C. These homes are going to sell; they sell for a huge profit, and that can increase the intergenerational wealth people have.\n\nFor 90 percent of American families, a home is the largest investment they\u2019re ever going to make. You only have so many chances to change the trajectory of your family. One of the things that inspired me to run for attorney general four years ago was I saw the housing crisis. I\u2019m passionate about protecting homeowners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: What do you think of the Republican House\u2019s new revision of the Affordable Care Act? What can you do in Virginia to assure millions that they won\u2019t lose their health care?\n\nJF: I think this bill is a complete moral travesty and reckless fiscal policy. Utah, Kentucky, Ohio\u2014red states have expanded Medicaid, but we can\u2019t. Until we get our districts to reflect our voters, we\u2019re gonna be stuck, and we\u2019re not gonna be able to do the things we need to do.\n\nJust to reflect on the gerrymandering thing and policy, all five of Virginia\u2019s statewide officeholders are Democrats. Democrats have won Virginia in the last three presidential elections. Yet in the House of Delegates, 66 out of 100 members are Republican. That\u2019s a supermajority. In our congressional delegation, 7 out of 11 members of Congress are Republican. All this shows you the power gerrymandering can have on policy. As lieutenant governor, I want to fight for nonpartisan redistricting; it might be one of the most important issues of our time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You live in Virginia, you grew up in D.C., but came from Pittsburgh. Who\u2019s your team?\n\nJF: [Laughter.] Basketball team is certainly the Wizards. Since I went to Duke, Jordan is the only Tarheel I like, plus we have the same birthday. I\u2019m existentially torn between the Caps and the Penguins.\n\nTR: What is your position on the racist name of Washington\u2019s football team?\n\nJF: Speaking personally, I personally don\u2019t like the name. But I think we need to keep things in perspective. I think we\u2019re often diverted by issues like this\u2014but I don\u2019t want that to take away from existential threats to our community: health care, criminal justice, mass incarceration. I want to stay laser-focused on people having economic opportunity. With that said, if I owned the team, I\u2019d change the name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Last question: What\u2019s on your phone? What are you listening to right now; what are you watching ?\n\nJF: My favorite song right now is from the musical Hamilton. It\u2019s called \u201cMy Shot,\u201d and that\u2019s our campaign theme. We don\u2019t want people to give away their shot on June 13. I haven\u2019t had much time for TV lately; I\u2019ve spent over 35,000 miles in a car, but I read a lot. I\u2019m usually reading multiple books at once. On my reading list right now is The Warmth of Other Suns, The New Jim Crow, True Compass by Ted Kennedy and Team of Rivals.\n\nTR: Are you serious? That\u2019s like a college syllabus in political science. You really were made in a lab!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJF: [Laughter.] I\u2019m almost done. My favorite is When Hell Froze Over; it\u2019s about Doug Wilder\u2019s 1985 run for lieutenant governor of Virginia [Doug Wilder was the first African-American governor since Reconstruction], and A Reason to Believe by Deval Patrick [who was only the second African American to be elected governor in the United States].\n\nTR: Any last words for our readers, and potential voters, out there ?\n\nJF: We\u2019re the first major election since Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. In 2017, Virginia is going to be the place that sparks a progressive wildfire that spreads across the country.

Based upon the facts and recommendations presented to me, I made the decision to place Officer Derick Wiley on indefinite suspension. This is a term used for civil service employees, but it effectively means Officer Wiley\u2019s employment has been terminated.\n\nOur internal investigation revealed that Officer Wiley violated department policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will not be making any additional comments until the Dallas County Grand Jury completes its process.\n\n***\n\nEditor\u2019s note: At approximately 4:21 a.m. ET Saturday, Lyndo Jones was readmitted to the hospital because of serious complications stemming from the shooting. The Root will update you on his condition as details become available.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerick Wiley, 35, a 10-year veteran with the Mesquite Police Department in Dallas County, Texas, will face a grand jury on Nov. 28 to determine if he will face criminal charges for the Nov. 8 shooting of Lyndo Jones, 31, Jones\u2019 attorney S. Lee Merritt exclusively shared with The Root.\n\n\n\nWiley is currently on paid administrative leave pending the conclusion of two separate investigations into the shooting, one by the Mesquite Police Department and the other by the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nOn the night of Nov. 8, Jones was sitting inside his vehicle when the car alarm malfunctioned and began blaring. As he struggled to turn it off, someone approached him and asked if he needed assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones said that he did not, but that didn\u2019t stop the unidentified person from calling 911 and claiming that Jones was attempting to steal his own vehicle. The 911 call triggered a series of events that ended with Wiley shooting Jones twice in the back even though he was unarmed with his hands raised.\n\nJones was violently searched before being taken into custody and handcuffed to a bed while in critical condition at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. He was also denied his right to family visitation, according to his legal counsel, criminal defense attorney Justin Moore, who stepped in to represent Jones on behest of civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt.\n\nMerritt is representing Jones in his civil case against Dallas County and the Mesquite Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Jones was first taken into custody and hospitalized, there were no criminal charges filed against him, which led Moore to investigate why Jones was still technically being held by the Police Department.\n\nDays later, after Moore was forcibly removed from the hospital for insisting that the MPD immediately halt an illegal interrogation of his client, Jones was charged with evading arrest.\n\nAccording to Jones, he requested that his attorney be present for the questioning, but was told by MPD investigators that he didn\u2019t need an attorney because they weren\u2019t there to interrogate him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLt. Brian Parrish, a spokesperson for the Mesquite Police Department, insisted during a press conference that questioning Jones without legal counsel present was not in violation of his constitutional rights because he was not being questioned as a suspect but as a \u201cpossible complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my investigators spoke to this individual in the hospital ... it was consensual and it was in reference to him being shot. It was not in reference to any offense he may or may not have committed,\u201d Parrish said.\n\nParrish\u2019s claim runs counter to that of Jones\u2019 attorneys, who were told by guards that Jones would absolutely not be questioned without his lawyers present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office reviewed Wiley\u2019s bodycam footage of the shooting, leading District Attorney Faith Johnson to dismiss the misdemeanor charge against Jones\u2014on the same day the MPD filed it\u2014and to open a criminal investigation against Wiley.\n\n\n\nJones was finally released on Nov. 15, but according to Parrish, the charge may be revisited.\n\nThe Mesquite Police Department claims that Jones \u201cdemonstrated such physical strength that it took three officers just to hold him down until paramedics could arrive at the scene to assess his injuries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that, I\u2019m not an expert on human strength, but I think if someone has been shot and handcuffed and on the ground, and it still takes four large men to hold him down, that might indicate there are other factors in place,\u201d Parrish told local station CBS-DFW.\n\nNot content to play games with the Mesquite Police Department, Merritt, who is representing Jones in his civil case against the MPD, unapologetically admits that his client was high on marijuana and cocaine while sitting in his parked vehicle. Still, he makes it clear that his being high should not give police officers license to shoot unarmed people who are minding their own business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe romanticized search for the perfect victim is futile and dangerous,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cMy client was doing absolutely nothing that warranted this police officer opening fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this pre-emptive, transparent vilification of innocent people play out time and time again,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cLyndo Jones is a hardworking father of two young daughters who was profiled by a stranger and shot by Officer Wiley for no reason at all. Wiley is the violent perpetrator here, not my client.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Merritt, the Nov. 28 grand jury hearing means nothing in and of itself.

But insiders know there is one part of America\u2019s legal system that has an outsized influence on convictions, sentencing and incarceration:\n\nLocal prosecutors.\n\nHere are a few facts that bear witness to the oft-forgotten power of local prosecutors:\n\nBureau of Justice Statistics (pdf) data shows that 87 percent of all U.S. inmates are housed in state prisons.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2008, crime and arrests dropped, but incarceration rates rose because prosecutors filed more felony cases.\n\nIf President Donald Trump pardoned every single person in federal prison tomorrow, the number of people incarcerated would only drop from 2.1 million to 1.9 million.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the local prosecutors who drive mass incarceration, and it is the local prosecutors who can end it.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in Philadelphia decided to do something about it when they selected Larry Krasner to be district attorney with nearly 75 percent of the vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a stunning victory by a man known for taking on civil rights cases and suing the Philadelphia Police Department. Krasner ran on a platform of criminal-justice reform and ending mass incarceration that inspired local activists and made others call him \u201cunelectable.\u201d\n\nBut he is just a prosecutor, not a judge or a legislator, right? What could he do?\n\nKrasner has decided to use his prosecutorial discretion in unprecedented ways. He promised to never ask for cash bail for a nonviolent offender, which is perfectly legal and up to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Cash bail has long been derided as a for-profit system that penalizes poor people before they are convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKrasner also vowed to curb police corruption by prosecuting cops with as much zeal as the criminal-justice system targets others. His platform states that he will not prosecute cases where the police are abusive, and the new DA also vowed that he will end the illegal stop-and-frisk program by \u201crefusing to bring to trial cases stemming from illegal frisks and searches.\u201d\n\nThe new prosecutor says that he will no longer seek the death penalty; nor will he seize any defendant\u2019s assets until after a conviction has been made. Krasner also plans to steer cases of drug possession and nonviolent offenses toward treatment programs, and he says that he will seek to end the drug war by treating drug use as a medical problem.\n\nCould this work? Many people think so. It has been done before. Harris County, Texas, instituted a no-cash bail system that freed dozens of low-level nonviolent people who were in jail just because they couldn\u2019t afford to pay their way out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014 the district attorney representing Brooklyn, N.Y., decided that he wouldn\u2019t pursue low-level marijuana arrests. Florida prosecutor Aramis Ayala announced that she would stop seeking the death penalty earlier this year, and Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby dropped more than 100 cases after police officers seemingly falsified evidence.\n\nNationwide, more than 90 percent of all criminal convictions are determined by negotiations with prosecutors that result in plea agreements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if the thought of an orange totalitarian sleeping in the White House upsets you, when it comes to ending mass incarcerations in your state and community, it is still important to know:\n\nYour vote counts.", "keywords": ["residents", "help", "krasner", "end", "cases", "local", "nonviolent", "proved", "prosecutor", "incarceration", "prosecutors", "system", "mass", "voting", "philly"], "polarity": 0.10910845910845912, "subjectivity": 0.4042997542997543},

In 2016 a Supreme Court decision made the 2012 ruling apply retroactively, yet the state of Louisiana continues to push back and fight against giving juvenile offenders an opportunity at parole.\n\nThe Times-Picayune reports that according to the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights, prosecutors in the state are trying to block too many juvenile murderers from having a chance at parole\u2014which means the state may not be in compliance with the high court ruling.\n\nLouisiana district attorneys have tried to block, or have already successfully blocked, about one-third of the juvenile murderers who meet the state\u2019s requirement of having served 25 years and completed educational programming to qualify for parole.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, only juveniles who are considered \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d and incapable of being rehabilitated should be sentenced to life without parole\u2014and those should be rare cases. Based on that, Jill Pasquarella\u2014who is an attorney for the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights\u2014told Nola.com that it is unreasonable to think a third of all juvenile lifers in the state would meet the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d\n\nBecause prosecutors have challenged the parole eligibility of so many juvenile lifers, Pasquarella said that the state will be headed back to court\u2014which will cost the already cash-strapped state hundreds of thousands of more dollars. In addition to the cost of funding a second defense of the state law, in some cases, the state will have to pay the lawyers that represent the juvenile lifers in these cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPete Adams is the executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, and he acknowledges that the state is probably headed back to court, but he says the Supreme Court needs to add more clarity to what \u201cworst of the worst\u201d means with regards to juvenile lifers.\n\n\u201cEventually the U.S. Supreme Court will say what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not,\u201d Adams told Nola.com. \u201cIf the U.S. Supreme Court says no one can get life without parole or who can\u2019t get it, we will abide by that.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, when the Supreme Court did make its ruling in 2012, Louisiana answered that by creating a law that only gave access to parole to juvenile lifers who had been sentenced after 2012\u2014not those who were already in prison at that time. A juvenile lifer challenged the Louisiana law, and in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the state clarification and said it needed to give juvenile lifers who were already locked up a chance at parole as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to that, during the 2017 legislative session, the Louisiana law was rewritten so that beginning this month (November), juvenile lifers who have served 25 years and meet other requirements, such as obtaining a high school diploma equivalent, would have a shot at parole. The new law leaves room for prosecutors to challenge any juvenile lifer\u2019s access to parole through a special hearing.\n\nThe Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, run by Leon Cannizzarro, has reviewed the cases of 64 juveniles serving life for murder\u2014more than any other district attorney in the state. The office has filed motions to block 32 of those cases from parole eligibility.\n\nThose 32 cases count in the number that makes up the one-third of the total cases in the state in which the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights says state prosecutors are seeking to challenge parole access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, state Sen. Dan Claitor (R-Baton Rouge)\u2014who sponsored this year\u2019s revised juvenile lifer legislation\u2014conceded that the state\u2019s numbers don\u2019t look good when it comes to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cI would have to agree\u2014if those numbers are correct\u2014it probably does not fit within the rails of what the Supreme Court has said,\u201d Claitor said. \u201cI just think it is a little premature until we have good solid numbers out there.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Times-Picayune.", "keywords": ["state", "parole", "louisiana", "supreme", "la", "worst", "law", "cases", "seeking", "working", "despite", "juvenile", "court", "lifers", "ruling", "district"], "polarity": -0.08184300993124521, "subjectivity": 0.45011713776419665},

People can twist statistics to fit any narrative. When debating race, some skeptics (usually white people, racists and black men with no facial hair) are willing to easily dismiss your assertions if you don\u2019t have peer-reviewed, scientific proof. Pulling out data from a study during a debate about racial injustice is like licking the big joker and sticking it to your forehead.\n\nNot only are there disparities in arrests, prosecution, sentencing and incarceration between blacks and whites, but a new study has revealed that even when defendants are willing to plead guilty to a crime, prosecutors will still offer black defendants much harsher plea deals than their white counterparts.\n\nCarlos Berdej\u00f3, a researcher at Loyola University, recently completed a study entitled \u201cCriminalizing Race: Racial Disparities in Plea Bargaining\u201d (pdf), which highlights the racial disparities in the criminal-justice system by examining the differences in the way prosecutors handle misdemeanor crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is not the felonies that often saddle black and brown people with criminal records, fines and jail sentences. Law-enforcement officers and prosecutors charge defendants with misdemeanor crimes more often, and these charges receive less focus because of a number of factors, including the severity of the alleged offense, the salaciousness of the details and the lack of public outcry.\n\nBerdej\u00f3 looked at misdemeanor crimes in Wisconsin. He focused on the state because of the wealth of detailed information that state includes in its data, including the race, gender, age and criminal history of the defendant. Wisconsin also has a plea bargaining process that is not guided by mandatory maximums or minimums, which means that the sentences and punishment are almost always left up to the discretion of prosecutors and judges.\n\nHe examined 30,807 cases over a seven-year period and found a number of disturbing facts, in almost every phase of the criminal-justice system. The study determined biases in arrests, sentencing and the types of plea deals that were offered, and it found several, including these:\n\nWhite people facing misdemeanor charges were more than 74 percent more likely than black people to have all charges carrying potential prison time dropped, dismissed or reduced.\n\n\n\nWhite people with no criminal history were more than 25 percent more likely to have charges reduced than black people who also had no criminal history.\n\n\n\nBlack defendants were 19.38 percentage points more likely than white defendants to be incarcerated.\n\n\n\nBlack offenders, on average, received sentences 1.23 months longer than those given to whites.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is the plea bargaining process that exposes the differences in the way the justice system criminalizes blacks suspected of committing crimes. The data shows that whites were 74.9 percent more likely to see the magnitude of their misdemeanor crimes lessened, and 25 percent more likely than blacks to have their misdemeanor charges reduced, dropped or amended.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut aren\u2019t blacks more crime prone? That\u2019s probably why they get harsher penalties.\u201d\n\nNot according to Berdej\u00f3\u2019s research. In the cases where the defendant had no prior convictions, white defendants were 46 percent more likely to have their charges reduced or erased than \u201cthe blacks.\u201d The statistics hold true even when researchers controlled for the type of crime, the quality of the attorney and the experience of the prosecutor. In other words, when Berdej\u00f3 examined every variable that could explain the racism in the criminal-justice system, blacks still received harsher sentences and got worse deals than whites when they pleaded guilty to crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of this study are consequential for three reasons:\n\nProsecutorial discretion: Wisconsin law allows prosecutors and judges to determine plea bargains and deals. The research shows that when they\u2019re given the latitude, the actors inside the criminal-justice system will always produce racially biased results.\n\nEconomic impact: The fines and penalties associated with these crimes affect entire communities. The inability to pay could land you in jail. It means that black families are more likely to lose a potential earner because black parents are incarcerated more often and longer than whites. Furthermore, convictions for misdemeanors and felonies affect the ability to get financial aid for education, employment opportunities and earning potential. The criminalization of African Americans: The study shows that black people are more likely to be arrested for committing the same crimes. Blacks receive longer prison sentences. Blacks get their charges dropped or reduced less often. All of these facts show how blacks are criminalized and viewed as more dangerous, even when the pool with which they are compared consists of white criminals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure none of this comes as a surprise to anyone reading this, but the next time some \u201calt-right\u201d-leaning fart bubble starts explaining how blacks make up so much of the prison population, commit so many crimes or don\u2019t work, or presents some other insidious stereotype that is selectively remembered by your I\u2019m-not-racist-I\u2019m-just-looking-at-the-facts friend, slam this study on the table and remind that person that whiteness is, and will always be, America\u2019s trump card.\n\nRead the entire study here (pdf).", "keywords": ["plea", "white", "blacks", "crimes", "charges", "reveals", "black", "defendants", "whites", "favors", "likely", "told", "misdemeanor", "system", "yall", "phase", "study", "criminaljustice"], "polarity": 0.07264019505398815, "subjectivity": 0.47224254034598856},

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.).\n\n\u201cWe felt that this was an issue over the last months, as we have continued to work with our players on issues of equality and on issues of criminal-justice reform, that was surfaced for us, and we thought it was appropriate to lend our support to it,\u201d Lockhart told reporters, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBut it\u2019s the timing of the endorsement that\u2019s most striking. The league is still desperately trying to move past the controversy surrounding player protests against racial injustice and police brutality during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NFL\u2019s action also comes just a day after news broke that former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick is filing a grievance against the NFL\u2019s owners for collusion.\n\nKaepernick is widely (and justly) credited for bringing social and racial issues to the fore when he began sitting\u2014then taking a knee\u2014during the national anthem. Since then, other players have taken up Kaepernick\u2019s mantle, both on and off the field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhiladelphia Eagle Malcolm Jenkins, former Baltimore Raven Anquan Boldin and Detroit Lion Glover Quin have all spoken to Congress on the issue of police and criminal-justice reform within the past year.\n\nIt\u2019s only now, with the endorsement of the Grassley-Durbin bill, that the league itself has decided to take any action.\n\nThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t taken any position on the bill, though it directly contradicts Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 instructions to federal prosecutors earlier this year that they pursue maximum sentences for drug offenses. In fact, despite having broad bipartisan support, the Grassley-Durbin bill has failed to reach the Senate floor. Key Senate Republicans, along with the Klu Klux Keebler himself, have opposed the bill, and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring the measure to the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what impact the league\u2019s endorsement could have on the bill\u2019s passage, but the timing raises questions, to say the least. While individual players have called for criminal-justice and police reform, the Post reports that the league has only recently gotten involved with the legislation:\n\nBut a spokesman for Grassley added that the NFL had not coordinated with the bill\u2019s congressional sponsors in advance of its decision. In the meantime, no other sports league has signed on. A spokesman for the NFL Players Association did not immediately return a call for comment about whether the football players\u2019 union would also endorse the bill.\ufeff\n\n\n\nThe NFL\u2019s endorsement and its timing rings of other PR-oriented moves the league has made in response to a crisis. After video circulated of former Baltimore running back Ray Rice clocking his then-fiancee in the face, the league doubled down on punishments for players accused of domestic violence. It also kicked off a public-service campaign, \u201cSay No More.\u201d What it didn\u2019t do was actually punish its players (I\u2019m looking at you, Jerry Jones).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Grassley-Durbin bill is a much-needed step toward reforming the criminal-justice system. Whether the NFL\u2019s endorsement means anything in terms of pushing the bill through remains to be seen, but supporters of Kaepernick and the NFL players\u2019 protest are right to feel conflicted. Supporting the bill is the right thing to do; the league\u2019s motivations for this foray onto Capitol Hill are dubious, to say the least.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["nfl", "case", "criminaljusticereform", "spokesman", "sentences", "nfls", "league", "curious", "players", "bill", "timing", "endorsement", "criminaljustice"], "polarity": 0.0073683261183261186, "subjectivity": 0.37760191197691206},

John Bel Edwards in June, in hopes of changing Louisiana\u2019s reputation as the most imprisoned state in the country.\n\n\n\nIt is the hope that the act will reduce the state\u2019s prison population by 10-12 percent and save some $262 million over the next 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Prator, it\u2019s all a waste.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the state of Louisiana is risking our safety for bragging rights and to save money,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Prator later would show his whole ass, showing that he really doesn\u2019t care about safety or bragging rights. He is concerned, it would seem, about saving money, but only in the form of cheap or free labor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [prisoners] that you can work, the ones that can pick up trash, the work-release programs\u2014but guess what? Those are the ones that they\u2019re releasing!\u201d Prator fumed in a video clip tweeted out by Shaun King. \u201cIn addition to the bad ones \u2026 they\u2019re releasing some good ones that we use every day to wash cars, to change the oil in our cars, to cook in the kitchen, to do all that where we save money, well, they\u2019re going to let them out!\u201d\n\nWell, that wasn\u2019t subtle at all. Do tell us how you really feel, Steve.\n\nI know I\u2019m not the only one fed up, because in surveying the video, I found this guy, who is clearly over it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel you, fam.\n\nAnyway, as KSLA notes, Prator gave out a list of 33 inmates who would be the first to be released on Nov. 1. Some of those on the list did not qualify for release until 2025, mind you, with charges ranging from possession with intent to distribute marijuana and aggravated flight to DWI and illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Correction Secretary James Le Blanc told the news station that he wasn\u2019t sure where Prator was getting his information and facts, and cited inaccuracies in Prator\u2019s assessment of the act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s some opening of the gates and everybody\u2019s releasing here,\u201d Le Blanc said. \u201cThis is 1,400 inmates that are going to 21 different districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have all the respect in the world for Sheriff Prator. I just don\u2019t know if he really knows what the numbers look like,\u201d he added.\n\nLe Blanc told KSLA that after the first wave of 1,400 inmates are released, releases would taper down to about 30 a month, and once again, it would only affect nonviolent and non-sex offenders who qualify.\n\nAs for the 192 inmates who Prator said were going to be released from Caddo, well, Le Blanc said that as far as he knows, the act only releases 35 come November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can put people that need to be in these beds in. More violent offenders and sex offenders and people that we need to be dealing with and providing the adequate resources and programs to while they\u2019re in prison,\u201d Le Blanc told KSLA.\n\nRead more at KSLA-TV.", "keywords": ["state", "sheriff", "act", "le", "laws", "nonviolent", "prator", "blanc", "good", "inmates", "cars", "furious", "theyre", "ones", "need", "told", "wash", "release", "la"], "polarity": 0.09494404174636735, "subjectivity": 0.511590573509178},

I\u2019m almost 40 years old, which means that I grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s listening to Common (n\u00e9e Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.) when he was rapping about watermelons and communism and asking to borrow a dollar. I still own a copy of his classic album Resurrection, which has his name listed as Common Sense\u2014you know, before the lawsuit that had him change his name to Common.\n\nThe Common I see today is a far cry from the rapper Common (Sense) that used to be part of hip-hop great debates; his GOAT potential was always on the table. His One Day It\u2019ll All Make Sense (my God, \u201cInvocation\u201d is perfect) and Like Water for Chocolate albums are indisputable classics. Be is a classic Kanye album (seriously, Kanye had the most memorable verse on the entire record, and the intro song \u201cBe\u201d is easily one of Kanye\u2019s best beats of all time\u2014fight me, bro).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Common from the \u201990s was still beefing with all comers\u2014remember, this is the nigga who beefed with Ice Cube in his prime and Louis Farrakhan intervened, and who also took shots at both Hype Williams AND Puffy at their height on the Roots\u2019 \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life)\u201d from 1999\u2019s Things Fall Apart album. Com Sense from the City of Wind was Chicago\u2019s answer to Nas, a street poet who participated in the culture he was helping to curate in real time. He was part of the Soulquarians collective, pushing the genre forward artistically.\n\nAnd then shit changed. Common went from being a rapper\u2019s rapper to \u201cGlory,\u201d a rap song for white people who read Ta-Nehisi Coates books. His albums weren\u2019t bad, per se, but his verses were less biting, less edgy, less memorable and more generally vague mixed with corny attempts at crossover success. Gone was the social commentary in favor of comments to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show in 2015 like this, via HuffPost:\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve been bullied, we\u2019ve been beat down and we don\u2019t want it anymore. We are not extending a fist and we are not saying, \u2018You did us wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m extending my hand in love,\u2019\u201d he said to host Jon Stewart. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the past as much as we can and let\u2019s move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we are going to try to help ourselves, too.\u201d \u201cMe as a black man, I\u2019m not sitting there like, \u2018Hey, white people, y\u2019all did us wrong.\u2019 We know that existed,\u201d Common said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to keep bringing that up. It\u2019s like being in a relationship and continuing to bring up the person\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m saying, \u2018Hey, I love you. Let\u2019s move past this. Come on, baby, let\u2019s get past this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, one could say that Common somehow stumbled into the sunken place, but that\u2019s not accurate at all. Assuming that the sunken place has something to do with access to or dating white women, that\u2019s not Common\u2019s ministry, for the most part. He\u2019s been linked with Taraji P. Henson, Serena Williams, Kerry Washington and, of course, the original knit-pants-procurement specialist, Erykah Badu. So what the hell happened? How does one of the most aggressive rappers whose entire M.O. was keepin\u2019 it real become hip-hop for white people?\n\nSimple. He secured the bag. And he found out what rappers who make a transition ALL say: Rap checks ain\u2019t shit compared with movie, television, commercial and \u201cWhite people love me\u201d checks. Common made it into television and movies, and even as a struggle actor in Wanted and Smokin\u2019 Aces, and an entirely unbelievable role as an NBA superstar in Just Wright opposite Queen Latifah\u2014another ultimate bag securer\u2014he was likely clearing more per film than most of his album royalty checks.\n\nThis man went from \u201cCom, I make righteous bitches get low\u201d to performing poetry at the White House to doing NPR Tiny Desks to winning an Oscar and several Grammys. He was a Gap model. He\u2019s in Microsoft commercials as the damn voice of Microsoft. Common figured out how to secure the fuck out of the bag, and his rapping suffered for taking a backseat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think any of this is negative. At least not for him. Common might not be a very good rapper at this point, but hell\u2014he used to be hungry. This nigga is eating now. A lot. When he wants to and where he wants. He went from British Knights to Balenciaga. When your drive as a rapper is largely tied to being underappreciated, lack of respect or anger at society, better circumstances and access to money and resources change shit. Then the angst subsides. It\u2019s hard to stay mad in Ferragamo slippers and sippin\u2019 Dom Perignon, or at least not that White Star!\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll bet Common laughs to the bank (or more likely laughs when direct deposit hits) every time he thinks about where he started and where he is now. He has made the absolute most of the hip-hop game. Folks reach out to him to do songs for major motion pictures that end up nominated for Academy Awards for the most vapid, boring, black-music-for-white-people bullshit (like \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d with Andra Day, which might as well have been called \u201cGlory-er\u201d), and they cut big checks.\n\nHell, I\u2019m wondering if he even tries anymore, and he still secures the bag every time. His latest album, Black America Again, even missed the mark despite its supreme timeliness. There were some familiar flashes of brilliance and very solid production. It just didn\u2019t have ... it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPretty much, he\u2019s dad rap now\u2014he is a father\u2014but he still has all the respect of the hip-hop community for past achievements in the inner-city hip-hop arts. White people can look at Common and say, \u201cI like that Common; \u2018Glory\u2019 was so moving and inspirational and really made me rethink that hippety-hop,\u201d and the rest of us just say, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s good to see him rich and shit, and at least we got Like Water for Chocolate.\u201d Common is out here being the change he wants to see.

Press caught it, her team deleted it and we never thought about it again ... until Tuesday, when two anonymous sources confirmed to Billboard that the tour is definitely real, but Bey can\u2019t talk about it because of Coachella.\n\nHmmm.\n\n\n\nOne of the aforementioned two sources told the pub, and I quote, \u201cA hold for the tour had been placed at a number of North American stadiums.\u201d This is exciting, to say the least: The last time a Jay-Bey tour happened was in 2014, their infamous On the Run Tour. It\u2019s been two new albums (J\u2019s 4:44 and B\u2019s Lemonade) and four years since, and I\u2019m hungry for more, goddamn it.\n\nSo why can\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z spit out the good news and ease our troubled minds? Coachella might really be to blame\u2014Bey is headlining the festival this year, performing on Saturday night both weekends of the Indio, Calif., event: April 14 and 21.\n\nHistorically, Coachella\u2019s parent company, Goldenvoice, has required its big talent to hold off on any tour announcements until after the event, which makes sense: If I\u2019m only trying to see Bey and a few other acts, it\u2019s much, much, much cheaper to wait until she comes near me, and I get to avoid Coachella, which seems unbearable. Win-win, y\u2019all.\n\nIf she (and her husband, lest we forget) waited until the Monday following the end of Coachella, April 22, as Billboard points out, they\u2019d still have 98 days to announce, sell tickets and market the Philadelphia show.

I, however, suspect that it had something to do with Trump giving him a shoutout on Twitter.\n\nDiddy clocked in at No. 2 with $825 million.

Being able to see friends and family members in person, to laugh and enjoy conversations together, is a way to make long sentences seem shorter. It helps families stay bonded, helps children know family members who may otherwise be absent from their lives and gives inmates something tangible to remind them that there is a life waiting for them on the outside.\n\nFor inmates in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center in Gretna, La., those visits will be a thing of the past beginning Oct. 10, when the facility switches to a video-visitation program similar to one implemented at lockups in New Orleans a few years ago, the New Orleans Advocate reports.\n\nNewly promoted Jefferson Parish Sheriff Jeff Lopinto believes that there are many benefits to a video-visitation system. In a statement on Wednesday, he said that one of the biggest benefits would be ending the possibility that visitors would pass contraband to inmates during visits.\n\nIn addition, Lopinto said that although both types of visits require monitoring, it takes fewer staff members to monitor video feeds than it does to monitor in-person visits.\n\nLopinto also believes that video visitation will increase the availability of inmates to see their loved ones. Although in-person visits were available only for two-hour blocks once per week depending on an inmate\u2019s cell assignment, video visitation will allow friends and relatives to communicate with an inmate via cellphone or computer nearly 12 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds promising, right? Too bad it isn\u2019t free.\n\nUsing the video-visitation service remotely will cost nearly $13 for a 20-minute session. That price could be cost-prohibitive to many families and discourage them from using the service. This means that some inmates could become alienated from their families and friends altogether, and that is what some attorneys who work in criminal defense and criminal justice are afraid of.\n\nKatie Schwartzmann is an attorney and co-director of the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center in New Orleans. She and local defense attorneys Jay Daniels and Craig Mordock all told the Advocate that there is research showing that incarcerated people who have access to their loved ones while in jail have an easier time reconnecting with them after they are released, and that helps them avoid returning to a life of crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three attorneys also expressed concern that in this instance, personal contact from the outside world is being removed from a facility that primarily houses people who are awaiting trial and have not been convicted of a crime.\n\n\u201cPeople who are simply detained need access to family members,\u201d Mordock said. \u201cAnd in-person visitation is radically different than doing a Skype session.\u201d\n\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s office, free video-visitation sessions will be made available once a week at a sheriff\u2019s facility in Marrero, La. Three additional visits per day can be arranged, using the remote service, at a cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo: Cash bond system. Check. Costly collect calls. Check.

It was a balmy 69 degrees where I live, but there must be a reason I didn\u2019t get an invite. Probably the Mueller investigation.\n\nAnyway, Us Weekly reports that Hov and Queen Bey turned the garage at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles into an old-school Hollywood glamour lounge for around 150 guests who were sworn to secrecy, which upsets me even more, because I\u2019ve always wanted to go to the Chateau Marmont.\n\nHonestly, I have no clue what the Chateau Marmont is, but had my invitation not been stolen by kids in the neighborhood, I could have found out.

While Organix, Do You Want More?!!!??! (personal fave) and Illadelph Halflife were all dope albums with superb hits\u2014\u201cSilent Treatment,\u201d \u201cClones,\u201d \u201cProceed\u201d and \u201cWhat They Do\u201d immediately come to mind\u2014Things Fall Apart is the one where everybody really took notice. Buoyed by Grammy-winning lead single \u201cYou Got Me,\u201d featuring Erykah Badu (who rerecorded Jill Scott\u2019s original vocals for a higher profile), the Roots\u2019 fourth album managed to be critically acclaimed and commercially successful, becoming their first album to go gold and eventually platinum.\n\nWhile \u201cYou Got Me\u201d and \u201cThe Next Movement\u201d were singles, the best song on the album\u2014and one of the most perfect musical creations of all time\u2014started out as an interlude that, by the grace of God and all things right in the world (I imagine Wakandan prophets had a hand in this), was expanded into a full-length song featuring Common, \u201cAct Too (the Love of My Life).\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with the music. I\u2019d argue, seriously, that the beat for \u201cAct Too\u201d is one of the best beats in hip-hop history. Sure, it\u2019s not just a beat\u2014it\u2019s more of a musical composition\u2014but it\u2019s so ethereal and beautiful and fit perfectly with the verses. There\u2019s a reason that the Roots realized they needed to expand it from an interlude. I imagine they were sitting in the studio listening to it and Questlove was like, \u201cI can\u2019t just listen to this for a minute and a half; I need this to last for at least five minutes.\u201d\n\nI could listen to it for 10. And then to infinity and beyond. Listen, I don\u2019t know what God\u2019s favorite song or album of all time is. I\u2019d imagine God has a pretty varied musical palate. But I\u2019d be willing to bet all of the money in my bank account that this song is on his \u201cBest of Humans\u201d playlist.\n\n\n\nLyrically, we have pre-Hollywood-fame Common where he was still spitting with hunger with a continuation of the same observant theme from 1994\u2019s classic ode to hip-hop, \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d Common dropped his famous \u201cwhen we perform it\u2019s just coffee shop chicks and white dudes\u201d line and sent a few shots at Hype Williams and Puffy for turning hip-hop into commercial garbage (his opinion, not mine) with the shiny-suit era through their visuals and music, respectively. This was the Common we all knew and loved.\n\nOne of the knocks on Black Thought in all of the arguments about his GOAT status is that while he\u2019s clearly a top-tier lyricist, his verses are not memorable; most folks can\u2019t recite any lines or verses on instant recall. I\u2019ve made that argument. That\u2019s not the case on \u201cAct Too,\u201d for it\u2019s literally the only entire Black Thought verse I know from start to finish. When he opens up with \u201cThe anticipation arose as time froze, I stared off the stage with my eyes closed ... ,\u201d I can see it. It may help that the verse is short, checking in at waaaay less than 16 bars, but hey, the impact pushed back the first five rows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven almost 20 years later, \u201cAct Too\u201d still impresses me when I hear it. When I\u2019m in the car and I can\u2019t think of anything to listen to, and I\u2019ve already listened to Midnight Marauders on repeat, I always fall back on Things Fall Apart, specifically so I can listen to \u201cAct Too.\u201d It\u2019s one of those songs that I can absolutely say have added to my own life by virtue of their existence. There are certain moments where artists create works of art that are nothing short of blessings. \u201cAct Too\u201d is one of those works of art, helping to explain why hip-hop is now and always will be a love of my life.", "keywords": ["act", "listen", "album", "music", "fall", "love", "verses", "common", "history", "perfect", "black", "hiphop", "life", "things", "song", "roots", "moments"], "polarity": 0.21462818003913892, "subjectivity": 0.45669710806697117},

With over two decades in the trenches, Torres, who founded Wax Poetics magazine and was also executive editor at the lyrics site Genius, is now vice president of the urban catalog at Universal Music Enterprises. And in his new role, he\u2019s launched Universal Music\u2019s latest imprint, Urban Legends.\n\n\n\nUrban Legends can be described as a repository or catalog of all things hip-hop from Universal Music. The site will celebrate anniversaries of some hip-hop classics, as well as provide its audience with new and inventive ways to interact with the music and its artists. In an interview with The Root, Torres discusses his goals for the site, as well as his own vinyl loves.\n\nThe Root: How did the Urban Legends imprint concept come about?\n\nAndre Torres: I come from media, having run my own magazine and running the Spotify collaboration at Genius. When I got this position, I was looking at how things were being marketed and how hip-hop was dominating on music streaming services, but obviously there\u2019s no liner notes there, or some of the things I grew up with.\n\nI also knew younger people are now into collecting vinyl and obsessing over stuff. I figured it was good to start with one central location where we can bring everything together\u2014whether it\u2019s content, exclusive-material drops or all of our releases\u2014and act as a hub for Universal Music Group. It\u2019s urban music, going back decades. I think a lot of what people are listening to, catalogwise, there\u2019s a way to tie all of that together, and Urban Legends is the perfect destination for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: How has the site been received so far?\n\nAT: It\u2019s been great. We had a soft launch before the holidays and did a redesign a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019ve been getting a good response. I\u2019ve brought in Lauren Nostro, who I knew at Genius, and Tyrine Howard, who was at Fake Shore Drive, who\u2019s running social. We come from the music-media world, and I don\u2019t see us as competition from other music sites; they\u2019re our \u201chomies.\u201d We\u2019re going to them saying, \u201cYo, you love this record, why don\u2019t you come here and write about it?\u201d It\u2019s really a spot for fans. We\u2019re finding our niche and what works well for us, and discovering what is possible out here.\n\nTR: With your own background within music, how has the landscape changed since you started in music journalism?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: It\u2019s like night and day. Being in print media in the early 2000s, it was a much different game. The label system was stronger, there was a lot of indie labels. This was preweb. Once the internet became a huge part of music culture, its effect on the way people consumed music, it had a drastic effect on what content was being made around music and how people\u2019s attention spans were shifting.\n\nLabels, much like media companies who were focused in music, have been scrambling and trying to figure out what works. It\u2019s a process, because what worked two years ago doesn\u2019t even now. The Facebook algorithm switches so quickly, you have no other choice but to take it day by day. People are hungry for content, context and discovery, and whether you\u2019re talking about preinternet and now, a lot of that hasn\u2019t changed. There\u2019s a lot of freedom artists have now, and kids are free to express themselves in ways we haven\u2019t seen.\n\nTR: With Universal, who\u2019s had everyone from Tupac to Dr. Dre, what do you think their legacy is when it comes to hip-hop music?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: Looking at Universal with all of its tentacles globally, it\u2019s the biggest record label in the world. When I was looking into what this position means, and the material I\u2019d have my hands on, it was hard to argue with, because you\u2019re talking everything from Pac to Dre. From Def Jam to Motown. There\u2019s huge catalogs. There\u2019s a wealth of material at Universal.\n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve been there from the beginning of hip-hop, and this company has been committed to urban music from its inception. And them bringing me over proves how much more of a commitment the company has, and understands the importance of urban music.\n\nTR: Everyone who knows you knows you\u2019re a vinyl head. As a vinyl head, what\u2019s your favorite record?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: I own thousands and thousands of records. That\u2019s one of the hardest questions that you could ask me. One record that always pops up in my head is\u2014and it\u2019s revolutionary for me\u2014is 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul. Also, James Brown\u2019s The Popcorn record is revolutionary for me. It\u2019s difficult to name just one.\n\nTR: What do you think people are missing from not having a vinyl experience?\n\nAT: I think there\u2019s always been a sort of tactile part of music listening. It\u2019s always been that physical element. This younger generation is kind of the first that doesn\u2019t have that. But even with streaming music becoming a No. 1 genre, vinyl sales are still up year after year. And the No. 1 vinyl retailer is Urban Outfitters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYounger people are now looking for that tactile moment. Even though people have everything on their phone, people still want to be able to have something to show people what they love. And vinyl allows that. Kids are luckier nowadays because they have many more options and have the best of both worlds.\n\nTR: Where do you see Urban Legends in a year?\n\nAT: I want to build a strong community of super-hardcore fans of urban music. I want people to experience the catalog and making of these records with anniversaries of music. And how younger artists are influenced by our history of music, as well as physical products we\u2019ll be releasing this year. It\u2019ll put Urban Legends in a different light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not trying to do what has been traditionally done in a catalog space. We have great anniversaries this year, from Black Star to Slick Rick\u2019s Great Adventures. This year will be big on the content and product side. As we keep the momentum going, people will clearly understand that the site is where it\u2019s at. Hip-hop\u2019s catalog is dominating, and Urban Legends is positioned to do that better than everyone else.\n\nTo learn more about Urban Legends, visit its site.\n\n", "keywords": ["music", "universal", "talks", "theres", "vinyl", "torres", "musics", "site", "platform", "hiphop", "legends", "catalog", "vp", "editorial", "urban"], "polarity": 0.1860886959482465, "subjectivity": 0.39524125687047035},

For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness. So her visit to Parkland wasn\u2019t any more or any less useless than usual. Her uselessness is both hilarious and dangerous\u2014oh so fucking dangerous\u2014but it does have integrity. You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy. America has and even creates space for useless white people to survive and thrive.

I don\u2019t know exactly how I decided to listen to it\u2014I can\u2019t call myself a Skyzoo fan\u2014but since I did, it\u2019s been in heavy rotation. Skyzoo, as any hip-hop head will tell you, is a noted lyricist in the \u201990s tradition. He\u2019s got solid wordplay, substance, weaves in and out of bars effortlessly, rides the beats well\u2014basically everything you could ask for in a lyricist you get in Skyzoo.\n\nAnd until now, I\u2019ve never made it through an entire project of his. I\u2019m aware of them all. Because I\u2019m a hip-hop head, every time one of his projects drops, somebody asks me for my opinion on it. And I almost always give the same response: It\u2019s cool, but not really my bag. Put a pin in this.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that I\u2019m a meat-and-potatoes guy about my hip-hop. What that means is this: If the production isn\u2019t good or if you\u2019re not a good performer of the art, I don\u2019t care how good a lyricist you are; I can\u2019t critically consume it. Shit, I can barely listen to what you have to say. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always struggled with Lupe Fiasco and even Black Thought\u2014two of the best lyricists to ever do it, but I\u2019m not invested in their catalogs, though I love the Roots for what they do, and they are responsible for some of my favorite hip-hop creations: specifically, \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life),\u201d which is EASILY one of the best pieces of music, regardless of genre, ever composed.\n\nMy favorite rapper is Jay-Z. My favorite hip-hop album has long been De La Soul\u2019s De La Soul Is Dead, but I think I might have to change that to A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s Midnight Marauders. N.W.A.\u2014in all of their problematic glory\u2014have long been my favorite rap group, though Outkast is right in there at 1a. As you can see, my tendencies skew toward the \u201990s. My top five will almost always feature Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000 and Ice Cube the Rapper before he died in the early \u201990s and was reborn as Ice Cube the Guy Gettin\u2019 Those Checks.\n\n\n\nIn that same vein, I also do think that Tupac is one of the greatest to ever do it. Was he one of the best technical rappers ever? No. Best lyricists ever? No. But did he perform rap on record better than almost anybody else? Absolutely. Tupac made you feel what he was saying in ways that folks like Scarface and Ice Cube did, though Cube\u2019s pen game was clearly on a hundred, thousand, trillion. Tupac, though, wasn\u2019t a bad rapper at all. He had tremendous skill and was better at maximizing his strengths than almost any other rapper. But his performance on the microphone stands out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite rap song is Pete Rock and CL Smooth\u2019s \u201cThey Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),\u201d which for my money is the best rap song ever created. Which is interesting because CL Smooth would make not ONE single person\u2019s list\u2014outside of his family\u2019s\u2014of top 10, 20, even top 50 best rappers to ever do it. In fact, the only reason most of us know CL Smooth is because of the production he rapped over.\n\nIf Pete Rock weren\u2019t one of the greatest producers of all time, CL Smooth would be any other rapper from New York whose time came and went. And he\u2019s not a terrible rapper; he\u2019s just not great, either. Yet I know entire CL Smooth verses, and he sounded perfect over Pete\u2019s production. His voice is distinct and powerful. The marriage of the two artists made some of the best hip-hop of the \u201990s. So much so that I\u2019m super pissed that their album The Main Ingredient is unavailable on streaming services. Somebody needs to make a call.\n\nDespite the fact that I name-checked De La Soul Is Dead and Midnight Marauders (and honestly, you could throw Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic, Ice Cube\u2019s Death Certificate and Jay-Z\u2019s Reasonable Doubt in there to round out my top five), DJ Shadow\u2019s Endtroducing... (1996), RJD2\u2019s Deadringer (2002) and Dilla\u2019s Donuts (2006) are the three albums that resonate most deeply with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most telling part is that they\u2019re almost entirely instrumental hip-hop albums. RJD2\u2019s \u201cJune\u201d is particularly compelling as a piece of work. But they\u2019re producer-showcase albums where Shadow, RJD2 and Dilla spread their wings and do their things. DJ Shadow\u2019s song \u201cBuilding Steam With a Grain of Salt\u201d changed all kinds of shit for me. It even influenced the way I approached production and my own attempts at hip-hop artistry to this day.\n\nBut that highlights my struggle: Without a solid backing of music, it is very difficult for me to dig into what\u2019s being presented vocally, ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re a super technically proficient rapper who just happens to have a fairly droning voice. It\u2019s the Nas paradox\u2014one of the greatest to ever do it, top five dead or alive, known for trash beat selection, but he gets a pass because he\u2019s Nas and released Illmatic. Because of Illmatic (and to a lesser extent It Was Written), I have to listen to people tell me that even though his beats suck often, I should push past because the God MC is spitting that knowledge. Which, yeah, not always, boo.\n\nThis brings me back to Skyzoo, an artist I\u2019ve never listened to that heavily. After In Celebration of Us came out, because of how much I loved it, I had to ask myself what went wrong. I\u2019m aware of Skyzoo and have listened to his projects in parts, so what gives? I revisited several of his projects, and the same problem always resurfaced\u2014I didn\u2019t love the beat selection, even though I can hear the skill. None of it is bad; it just fades into the beats and background at times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I think he\u2019s got a very, very solid understanding of what works best for him. But most of it didn\u2019t draw me in because unlike rappers like Tupac or Ludacris or Scarface, whose voices and lyrical performances are super instrumental in their craftsmanship, he gets lost.\n\nMeanwhile, when I first pulled up \u201cEverything\u2019s Fine\u201d on In Celebration of Us, I INSTANTLY got invested when he started spitting. I was and am able to dig into the project because he picked some awesome beats to supplement his lyricism, even if he was the same solid Skyzoo he\u2019s always been, drawing it to the top of the beat for the first time in my listening experience.\n\nHell, it\u2019s the very reason that so many people from the \u201990s are familiar with and swear by Group Home\u2019s Livin\u2019 Proof album, and with all due respect, there\u2019s no reason to ever know Lil Dap or Melachi the Nutcracker. Melachi is so bad, he had Dap sounding like Nas. DJ Premier\u2019s production was SO good on that album that I can listen to it despite lyrics like this:\n\nYo, I rock on the block with the real hip-hop/As you start to clock ... and jock/Yo, I\u2019m coming off with mad rage/Eighteen, and hitting the real stage/But don\u2019t worry \u2019bout me, \u2019cause I\u2019m making it/And if I can\u2019t have it, then I\u2019m taking it/That\u2019s how it is, \u2019cause I\u2019m living trife/Where\u2019s my knife? Take a chance with your life/Rappers decapitate, and disintegrate/You I will mutilate, when I penetrate/Go for the one when I say raid/A hitman for hire and I wanna get paid/\u2019Cause bullets are sprayed and anybody is laid/More money is made and that\u2019s the family trade/See, I make moves and tell what\u2019s the truth/That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, to be living proof\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s Melachi\u2019s verse on the title track, \u201cLivin\u2019 Proof.\u201d Where\u2019s Offset when you need him? And if you think that verse is better than any verse any Migo(s) has spit, you should stick a quarter in your ass \u2019cause you played yourself.\n\nSkyzoo has always been a great rapper like Royce, Elzhi, etc. Always. And after revisiting previous projects, this album had the music that resonated the most with me. It only helps that the execution of the project is top-notch.\n\nI acknowledge that lyrics are the bedrock of rap music, so ultimately as a fan and consumer, I try my best to dig into the lyricism, but when you\u2019re largely a rapper\u2019s rapper, it\u2019s easy to get lost on a record. I can understand people who are able to focus on lyrics over bad beats for the sake of artistry. But songs are not just lyrics; songs are beats and rhymes. And I need the beats and performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m too big a fan of music to ignore a less-than-decent beat for the sake of some extremely talented lyricism. My mind is not set up that way. I want to feel what\u2019s happening, and the beats are often the entryway. And to be fair, it\u2019s why Tupac was a hard sell for many until Me Against the World. All Eyez on Me and The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory both have extremely solid production and are therefore much easier to consume and digest because Tupac performed the hell out of his records.\n\nThink about this: One of the big controversies Drake was involved in was that on his album If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late, he had writers. Quentin Miller is credited for several of the records, and reference vocal tracks surfaced with him performing the songs word for word. And they sucked. He sucked on them. Drake takes the same shit, Drakes them with the exact same words, and all of a sudden you have hits. The performance makes all the difference. It\u2019s indisputable. For me, performance and production are how I listen to hip-hop. Lyrics are important, but I can\u2019t just forgo the rest.\n\nHow do you listen to your hip-hop?", "keywords": ["listen", "album", "tupac", "production", "hiphop", "best", "beats", "im", "rapper", "skyzoo"], "polarity": 0.2334303142744702, "subjectivity": 0.5255721875527068},

However, in recent days, students Josh Gallagher and Connor Dietrich are refuting that narrative, both expressing disgust toward Gard on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, Gallagher wrote that Gard \u201ccalled himself a hero, and ... the media portrayed him as a hero when in reality he is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGallagher said that he was in Gard\u2019s class when the fire alarm went off and students started filing out. Then they heard gunshots, and about 15 of them stopped in their tracks before running back toward the classroom. At that point, however, Gard locked the door and refused to let them back in, Gallagher said.\n\n\u201cWe were stuck in the hall for four total minutes, ducking and in fear for our lives,\u201d Gallagher wrote. He said that another teacher eventually let him and the other students into another classroom, but the teen said that Gard \u201cleft 75% of his students out in the hallway to be slaughtered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGard, for his part, did a phone interview with CBS Miami while he and some of the students were still sheltered in his classroom, less than two hours after the shooting, awaiting the all-clear from police.\n\nGallagher pointed out that the teacher had been interviewed by multiple media outlets as a hero.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing but a coward,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cHe has revictimized the students he left out of his class by calling himself a hero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDietrich, who was one of the kids left in the hallway, told a similar story.\n\n\u201cAs one of the kids left in the hallway I want people to understand how terrifying and defenseless I personally felt,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe person I had to rely on left us to die and that\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nGard, meanwhile, said that he was just following protocol that mandated all doors be kept locked during an active-shooter drill or real-life emergency. He told the Sun-Sentinel that he was surprised that a student and his father were upset after the fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI looked back down the hall and no one was around\u2014no one,\u201d Gard said, acknowledging that 13 students had lagged behind and had wound up being locked out. \u201cYou have to close the door. That\u2019s protocol. We have no choice.\u201d\n\nGard said that he and the students who had gotten into the classroom were huddled in the dark by the desk when they heard loud banging on the door. He said that by the time he walked over to the door (an action he said was also prohibited), the banging had stopped.\n\n\u201cFast-forward to Sunday, when the parents came back for an open house,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of a sudden, this kid comes over and starts screaming at me.

I, however, suspect that it had something to do with Trump giving him a shoutout on Twitter.\n\nDiddy clocked in at No. 2 with $825 million.

It was an adorable gimmick, and enough to raise the question: Is Cross Colours due for a comeback?\n\nLaunched in 1989 by Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, the black-owned urban-streetwear label marketed itself as \u201cclothing without prejudice\u201d and was a perfect fit for the era of new jack swing, a Fresh Prince and \u201chappy\u201d hip-hop\u2014not to mention how well the clothing coordinated with our African medallions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished by boxy silhouettes\u2014worn intentionally even more oversized, of course\u2014Cross Colours\u2019 trademark bright-hued schemes were initially inspired by a swatch of kente cloth, as Walker told Bobby Kim\u2019s The Hundreds magazine in 2014:\n\nIt elevated into a lifestyle, a collection, a look, a style. It morphed. ... For us, the colors were not only for the people, but for the fabric, for the thread, for the united force of people. Gang violence was also very prevalent at that time. So then we said Cross Colours for all that too \u2013 to unite the colors of the gangs.\n\nThe brand was a hit, dominating the early-\u201990s urban-fashion landscape, and seen on everyone from Muhammad Ali to Paula Abdul. And then, just as quickly as it peaked, it fell, due in large part to its affiliation with Merry-Go-Round\u2014one of the era\u2019s premier fast-fashion retailers\u2014which declared bankruptcy and defaulted upon millions of dollars in orders from Cross Colours in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downward spiral would continue as trademarks changed hands; eventually leading the brand to become dormant for the next two decades.\n\nBut if Cross Colours\u2019 appearance on the Grammy stage came as a surprise to most, it\u2019s only because Walker and Jones have taken a tactical approach to quietly rebuilding their brand, beginning to harness the power of social media several years ago to gauge the interest of, and access to, a new generation, as they told Kim in 2014:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to sort out how we really want to present ourselves. ... Is it all vintage? Do we have better pricing? Higher pricing? So we\u2019re going through that \u2013 the motions right now. And what do we really mean to the consumer today? It\u2019s a younger, different generation. Do they know our brand? So we start with a little bit of Instagram and now we have 5,000 followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat following is now over 25,000\u2014and rising since Sunday night. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, we are still awaiting comment from Cross Colours.]\n\nBut while Bruno Mars and Co. rocked the classic baseball jerseys and bucket hats that Gen X instantly waxed nostalgic over, a visit to the Cross Colours site offers a refreshing update on the aesthetic, in addition to \u201cretro reissues\u201d\u2014where there was not an orange jersey in sight. Military-inspired looks and message T-shirts are in abundance, as well as a surprisingly sexy underwear line perfectly made for peeking out of the waistband of your saggy jeans.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re ready to rock rainbow stripes again (sorry, Cardi), we have to admit that just seeing the brand back in action takes us back to a happier time and place.

Even metal includes thrash, speed, death and crust punk (we\u2019re talking subgenres inside a subgenre ... it\u2019s like Inception, but for people who like guitar music).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there\u2019s absolutely no reason why trap, snap, bass, hyphy, crunk and \u201cmumble rap\u201d (which I\u2019m just learning is a controversial term, but ... they do be mumbling!) can\u2019t be included under the umbrella genre that is hip-hop.\n\nThe argument turns left for me, however, when you tell me I can\u2019t call a thing trash when it\u2019s obviously trash. Some things aren\u2019t subjective. 2 Chainz will never be 2Pac, just like Tyler Perry will never be James Baldwin. I don\u2019t know when we got into this \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d era of hip-hop discourse, but I\u2019m telling y\u2019all, it\u2019s for the birds. It\u2019s indicative of how a lot of us have become disconnected from the full spectrum of the culture.\n\nThe larger culture has always been critical of artists and music it determined to be inferior. It\u2019s where the phrase \u201cwack emcees\u201d comes from. If it seems disrespected, it\u2019s supposed to be. Hip-hop literally invented the word \u201cdiss.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true we oldies sound the same way our parents did when they were shitting all over whatever we were listening to when we were younger. But be honest, guys: Who, in their youth, ever gave a fuck about their parents\u2019 opinion on ... well ... anything? So let\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s so damaging.\n\n(And, if we\u2019re being honest, our folks were right about a lot of shit. If you grew up in the \u201990s, you had Boyz II Men, Jodeci, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and a few others who might be able to hold their own sharing a stage with Motown\u2019s finest. Even Boyz II Men would just barely be holding the Temptations\u2019 jockstrap. But I digress.)\n\nThe truth is, this isn\u2019t purely a generational thing, as there is no era in hip-hop where purists (or real \u201cheads\u201d) weren\u2019t talking shit about commercial rap music. Ask Kool Herc and Grandmaster Caz what they thought about the Sugarhill Gang\u2019s \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight.\u201d Ask Run-DMC how many elitist assholes had something to say about their crossover collaboration with Aerosmith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShit, I was calling out the unabashed wackness of mainstream pop rap when I was in my late teens and early 20s (meaning I was still of the current generation). We old-school hip-hoppers have always had a list as long as an MC Hammer remix of rappers from our era we absolutely despised. And none of our opinions had even the slightest impact on their bottom lines. Which leads me to a final question:\n\nWhy do you give a shit what we think?\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of popular music, you\u2019re on the favorable side of supply and demand, so I just don\u2019t understand the degree of contempt you have for the detractors of your faves. It\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting at the popular kids\u2019 table worried about what the second-string chess club is gossiping about. Migos spent all of 2017 at the top of every pop chart in the country. You think that nigga gives a fuck how trash I think he is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait ... what? Migos is three people? Well, shit\n\n\u201cWe the biggest group ever. Ever. In pop, hip-hop, all that, because every genre in music right now is structured off us. We got this culture.\u201d \u2014rapper Offset of Migos\n\nHell, try being an underground head. Think how much easier our lives would\u2019ve been if we had just liked what the masses were in to. Do you know how many women I wouldn\u2019t have had to eventually cancel because they kept hopping into my car and snatching my Pharoahe Monch out of the disc drive to bump that new Ja Rule or Nelly (by the end of this piece, you should all be able to guess my age).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI grew up in Atlanta, the city where clubbing is a staple of the culture and a rite of passage, as someone with a serious distaste for Lil Jon and the Ying Yang Boys (wait ... that\u2019s not right). I was the old guy in the club when I was, like, 22.\n\nMaybe I am just an old fogy shouting at the modern rap world to get off my lawn. But I\u2019d like to think that harsh criticism among the different sects of hip-hop fandom has always been more healthy than draining, and I fail to see how it prohibits the evolution of the culture or the ability of new generations to get their shine and add their own branches to the genre tree.\n\nTruth is, subgenre has always been present in hip-hop. What was the media-inflamed East Coast-vs.-West Coast beef but a battle between rap genres no different than when a death metal enthusiast declares their hatred for alternative punk?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll music is art, and all art\u2014when put on display\u2014is subject to the judgment and interpretation of both appreciative and unappreciative audiences.

The song samples her famous 1966 song \u201cFour Women,\u201d released on the Wild Is the Wind album. For those who were introduced to her through Jay-Z, I\u2019m both happy and sad: happy because at least they were introduced, and sad because that\u2019s a lot of good Nina Simone music they\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d is one of the most powerful songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["mississippi", "women", "music", "heard", "history", "perfect", "black", "nina", "introduced", "song", "released", "simones", "simone", "moments"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

I\u2019m here to ask for blessings for the rapper Post Malone. I know you are the creator of all things\u2014even this man who looks like the result of Pippi Longstocking fucking a semidomesticated billy goat. I read an article today about him in GQ where he was asked, \u201cDo you, Post Malone, ever feel anxious about working in a primarily black-identified genre of music?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer, Bijan Stephen, even noted his own feelings about Malone\u2019s hypocrisy when he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m black. I\u2019m young. I\u2019ve been put off by some of the things he\u2019s said about distancing himself from rap, from R&B, from anything, really, that\u2019s musically black-identified.\u201d\n\nStephen went on to explain: \u201cI enjoy Post\u2019s music, but I\u2019m skeptical: What\u2019s worse than appropriating a black sound without giving appropriate credit is doing that and not realizing why that might be wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Lord, you are the alpha and omega, and being that you are the only one in heaven or on earth who pledged two fraternities, I\u2019m sure you already knew this, our bright and morning star. In your omnipotence, I\u2019m sure you are aware of Post Malone\u2019s response, but Imma just type it out so the copyedit team won\u2019t ask me for the quote, Almighty One. Oh, ye Giver of Life, Death and Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Post Malone said:\n\nI definitely feel like there\u2019s a struggle being a white rapper. But I don\u2019t want to be a rapper. I just want to be a person that makes music. I make music that I like and I think that kicks ass, that I think the people who fuck with me as a person and as an artist will like.\n\nOh, Lord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to still this slapping spirit that is rising in my heart and tingling in my palms!

I felt the same thing when I read that quote from Post Malone, and I need you to eject this reneging spirit from my soul, Most High!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, Big Poppa (yes, I\u2019ve heard the gospel hymn when you said you love it when we call you that), take Post Malone\u2019s hand and guide him through the misery of being a millionaire and being white. I know it must be hard for him to exist in a world where he has every societal advantage that comes with whiteness while simultaneously getting to wade in the pool of black culture.\n\nI imagine it tastes like fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good, Evil and White Privilege. Yea, though Post Malone walks through the valley of the shadow of cultural appropriation, comfort him with your rod and staff. Or beat him.\n\nPlease beat him.\n\nAnd forgive him, Your Highness.\n\nForgive him, for he knows not what he\u2019s doing when he makes millions from an art form created by black people while distancing himself from the individuals and the struggle that birthed the art by stiff-arming anything remotely related to blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive him for dabbling in the outlaw-thug stereotype while not recognizing the privilege of not having every aspect of himself associated with the oppression and danger that goes along with his inverted shucking and jiving.\n\nOh, my Good & Plenty higher power, I know some will say that he is not guilty of cultural appropriation, but if hip-hop is a culture, and the definition of appropriation is \u201cthe deliberate reworking of images and styles from earlier, well-known works of art\u201d without attribution or acknowledgment, and Malone doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that he is a rapper, then I don\u2019t know what else to call him, dear Lord. A rap gentrifier? A rhyme colonialist? Motherfucker? (Forgive me for that, thou divine one.)\n\nBut most of all, ye magnificent with the sensational style, forgive Post Malone for his tone-deaf, oblivious whining about the paper-cut-deep criticism he receives for his third-grade-level lyrical, gold-front blackface as if he couldn\u2019t stop rapping tomorrow, waltz his ass back to the suburbs, and become the one thing in the world that is greater and exponentially more precious than being a young, famous, millionaire musician:\n\nA white man.\n\nIn this, and all things, we ask your blessings.\n\nAmen.", "keywords": ["know", "white", "malone", "post", "black", "dont", "lord", "sure", "im", "struggle", "prayer", "rapper"], "polarity": 0.13341600529100528, "subjectivity": 0.5150589726631394},

In fact, he\u2019s not even remotely tough. Trump is the dude who comes to the basketball court in a full official NBA shorts set to talk about how, when he was younger, he used to dunk on guys, but he never plays.

This is a time for grieving, and I wish someone would yank the president\u2019s comb-over and hip him to how to behave. Now isn\u2019t the time for this male-bravado bullshit while Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students are still struggling to make it to class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeventeen students and teachers were mercilessly gunned down, and the president has not only defended the National Rifle Association, guns, gun owners and NRA spokespeople but has also called for some teachers to be trained in taking down a school shooter. And now he\u2019s playing cowboy behind his Secret Service.\n\nCut the shit, draft dodger.\n\nAnd Trump didn\u2019t stop there. He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter!

You know I rock with you. You\u2019re my man 100 grand. But why are you devoting an entire explainer to the difference between two words I can just go and find in the dictionary?\n\nThank you for the kind words! I should tell you, though, that this explainer is actually about the colloquial use of \u201chungry\u201d and \u201cthirsty,\u201d not the standard definitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, I see. I never should have doubted you. Just like I never should have eaten that microwaved sashimi for lunch today.\n\nShit. I need to hurry with this explainer, then, because you\u2019re gonna die soon.\n\n\n\nAnyway, in a colloquial sense, \u201cthirsty\u201d and \u201chungry\u201d both mean the same thing. Each term is a way of articulating a person\u2019s ambition. Where they differ is in connotation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow so?\n\n\u201cHungry\u201d describes an ambition that\u2019s rooted in integrity. It implies hard work, diligence and dedication. You\u2019d advise any person attempting to achieve a goal to be hungry. \u201cThirsty,\u201d however, implies desperation. A blind ambition where your goals are suspect and you\u2019re more than willing to make questionable decisions to achieve them.\n\nI see. Can you provide an example?\n\nOf course! Let\u2019s say a high school sophomore wishes to be the starting point guard on the school\u2019s basketball team next year. If he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019s going to spend the entire summer refining his game, lifting weights and getting in better shape. If he\u2019s thirsty, however, he\u2019ll start a rumor that the kid he\u2019s competing with for that starting spot has herpes. And not just herpes herpes, but a rare herpes that can only be contracted through basketball contact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirsty niggas invent diseases?\n\nAnd spread unsubstantiated rumors. Shit, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the bubonic plague was caused by a crew of really thirsty sewer rats pissed that the house rats were getting all the cheese.\n\nIs thirst just based on ambition-based actions?\n\nNo. Thirst levels can also be based on why you have a particular ambition. Using the high school basketball player again, if he\u2019s hungry, he wants that starting spot to prove that he deserves it and to be able to compete on the highest levels. Perhaps he even wants to earn a basketball scholarship. If he\u2019s thirsty, he just wants to be a starter to increase his pool for potential prom dates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it possible to be hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nDefinitely! For instance, no one would deny that Drake has an impeccable work ethic. Especially back when he was releasing new mixtapes every few months. He was hungry to establish himself as, well, who he is today. But his actual content, while good (mostly), has always been thirsty.\n\nI mean, how many songs can one person write about \u201cAmber\u201d from \u201cSilver Spring\u201d who \u201cworked at Cheesecake Factory\u201d and \u201chooked you up with extra jalape\u00f1o poppers\u201d and how you always wished you could \u201cescape the world together\u201d but you\u2019re \u201ctoo infatuated with Houston strippers\u201d but still wish, sometimes, that you were \u201cnormal\u201d so you could have your \u201cCheesecake Factory romance\u201d in peace?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake is so thirsty, I\u2019m shocked his tonsils aren\u2019t sandpaper. Someone get that nigga an Aquafina!\n\nAnyone else hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nMiley Cyrus, whose career seems to be a perpetual vacillation between extreme hunger and extreme thirst. Taylor Swift was hungry once and now needs intravenous fluids. America, for all its faults, was hungry as fuck for a few hundred years. But now this entire country needs some Kool-Aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and Jay-Z.\n\nJay-Z?\n\nYeah. As interesting and laudable as 4:44 was, you have to admit that was a thirsty-adjacent album. Like, it wasn\u2019t quite parched, but it probably should have hydrated a bit more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. Well, how are the distinctions between hunger and thirst applied to our daily lives?\n\nThe internet, for instance, is a virtual petri dish for unregulated thirst. Like, you know how many cities have created bike lanes on roads, making it easier for people with bikes to travel? Well, the internet is a bike lane for thirsty niggas. Unsolicited DM sliding, unabashed desperation for likes and retweets, performative contrarianism\u2014these are all products of excessive thirst. One day, someone needs to dump the entire internet into a baptismal pool.\n\nThat would need to be a big-ass pool.\n\nI guess the ocean would do.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["sophia", "dj", "wardrobe", "women", "dope", "inside", "fashion", "career", "think", "hyacinthe", "double", "life", "night", "dressed", "feel", "really", "york"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

This means that whenever we go ANYWHERE, I have to have a few things on deck: diapers, wipes, a first-aid kit of some sort, snacks, and water or juice.

It\u2019s the business.\n\n\n\nNow, I have a fairly boss diaper bag that has all the pockets and several compartments in odd places that aren\u2019t handy until they\u2019re super handy.

They learn early on about \u201ctime and place.\u201d Other kids know that lesson, but ain\u2019t nothing worse than being hungry and bored. It\u2019s the same thing as being hangry, except when you\u2019re 6, being bored is the ultimate in, \u201cWHY IS THIS MY LIFE?!\u201d For whatever reason, snacks and juice typically shut kids up for a while as they happily munch away on whatever it is you decided to bring, from pita chips to Cheerios, temporarily satisfied with life.\n\nI imagine for a show as long as the Grammys were\u2014and good Lord, were they long\u2014that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bag was full of an assortment of amazing snack treats. And juice boxes. I\u2019d also bet money that while Blue Ivy has clearly done this before, they have conversations about whether or not to bring her along.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["gun", "law", "mental", "school", "proposed", "rick", "shouldnt", "yes", "health", "florida", "celebrate", "ranks", "weapons", "scott", "gov", "trump", "nra", "enforcement"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

From Blue Ivy letting us know she runs the Knowles-Carter household, to everyone with white roses in support of Time\u2019s Up, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s American satire and Kesha\u2019s powerful Time\u2019s Up-esque performance (featuring Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Andra Day and more), taking a stand has become an important thread in the makeup of an artist. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d said Janelle Mon\u00e1e, carrying the torch for equality for women with her Grammys appearance.\n\nMon\u00e1e shook the table with her speech:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry\u2014artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. To those who would dare try and silence us, we offer you two words: #TimesUp. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrammy nominees Logic and Khalid, alongside Grammy winner Alessia Cara, performed their powerful nominated song, \u201c1-800-273-8255.\u201d The song, about suicide, was a shift not only in the culture but also in the room, with the performers bringing a group of suicide survivors and family members of suicide victims onstage with them. Logic ended the performance with a stance on immigration policy, saying, \u201cBring us your tired, your poor and any immigrant who seeks refuge.\u201d\n\nTo say there were important moments at the Grammys this year is to make an understatement. Check out some of the best moments from the 2018 Grammys:\n\n\n\nKendrick Opens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2018 Grammys opened in a big way with Kendrick Lamar giving us a powerful political performance complete with American flags and marching soldiers. With tears in his eyes, Lamar rapped a mile a minute to songs like \u201cXXX,\u201d \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d marching alongside the soldiers and introducing us to his satire. The screens behind him read, \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Men in red hoodies fell to the ground every time Lamar extended his arm to shoot them.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t entertaining enough, Lamar brought out U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge and Dave Chappelle! Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell? Having actor and picture-of-perfection Shemar Moore and rapper and host Eve introducing SZA to the stage for her first Grammys performance. And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups.

For my money, few rappers could do what he did (pack that much substance into that many bars for that length of time and perform it so flawlessly) THAT well, and almost all of them are named Eminem or part of Slaughterhouse. I won\u2019t rehash all that he covered; that\u2019s been done already. But what has happened is that it should reignite a convo that exists in the rap community: Just where does Black Thought rank in the greatest-of-all-time conversation?\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve probably had a thousand \u201cWho is in my top five?\u201d discussions, give or take a hundred or so. At almost no time has Black Thought ever cracked my top five, which typically consists of Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Tupac or Ice Cube (AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted through Lethal Injection). There aren\u2019t any surprises on that list. It\u2019s a fairly standard \u201cmainstream\u201d list of GOATs.\n\nBlack Thought is as good as or a better rapper than every single person on that list. Yet he almost never makes my personal list, and based on the conversations I have, he typically gets left off a lot of other folks\u2019 lists, too, even extending them to top 10s. There are a few reasons why I think that\u2019s happened.\n\nFor starters, I think because he\u2019s part of such a great collective, the Roots, people sometimes forget to think of him in isolated terms. As an entity, the Roots are super beloved and appreciated, but we always lump them into one. Also because of their \u201cfirst hip-hop band\u201d image, I think sometimes Black Thought gets lost in that shuffle.\n\nWhen we think of the Roots, we think of Black Thought and Questlove, but we think of them in tandem and rarely of Black Thought as just pure rapper. Which is why I think every time he goes on shows and ends up spitting something, it stands out so much more. We are thinking of him as a solo entity in those moments, such as the Flex freestyle. Had Black Thought ever released a solo album, I think that might be different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he\u2019s been so consistent for so long, spitting at such a high level, that even when you are paying attention to him, it gets easy to overlook just how skilled he is. Which also gets back to him being lost in the collective, so to speak. They make music that often caters so well to his vocals that he sounds more like an instrument than an MC bodying a track. It\u2019s like D\u2019Angelo on Voodoo.\n\nThe most controversial of reasons is this: He sounds ... unexciting. He\u2019s not a sexy pick. I\u2019m a Black Thought fan, but that everyman-show-up-to-work-every-day-without-any-pizzazz thing tends to push him into the \u201cYeah, he\u2019s tight, but he don\u2019t really spark\u201d convo that people like Tim Duncan fell into. Duncan is the Big Fundamental; his game had very little razzle-dazzle or spark, so it was easy to forget you were watching one of the best to ever do it for so long. Of course everybody knows Duncan is one of the greats, but he\u2019ll end up in those conversations in a more interesting way now that his career is over.\n\nI think Black Thought is similar in that sense. Plain and simple, he\u2019s just that damn good. That freestyle wasn\u2019t a revelation for most of us who are familiar with the Roots. It was a super-skilled MC doing what super-skilled MCs do: They get nasty on the mic. For others it may have been an aha moment, and that\u2019s good for him, and hopefully it translates into new fans for him and the Roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the aforementioned reasons is particularly deep, but I think they are all relevant. Rappers in groups do struggle for that individual \u201cbest ever\u201d title, and it\u2019s usually when they step out on their own that we really start paying attention to their greatness. The catch here is that in the Roots, Black Thought has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting with assists from Dice Raw and Malik B., etc. Black Thought is primarily a solo MC in a band that we think of like a group.\n\nBut with freestyles like that one or any time he raps alongside musical guests on Jimmy Fallon or spits freestyles while on talk shows, you get the opportunity to appreciate just how special Black Thought is as an MC, IF he gets lost in the group shuffle. So here\u2019s the important question: Where DOES Black Thought rank in the GOAT convo?\n\nGlad you asked. For me? I think if Nas is in that convo, then so is Black Thought if I\u2019m being reasonable. I actually think Black Thought MIGHT be better than Nas, though Nas will always have Illmatic, which ensures his rap Mount Rushmore status for influence and impressiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggie will always be in my top five because I don\u2019t think there was a single weakness in his skill set, but I struggle with GOAT because of limited catalog, for obvious reasons. Jay is likely always going to be No. 1 because of how good he\u2019s been for so long and because of his cultural impact and footprint.\n\nBlack Thought, while being easily one of the most skilled rappers to ever do it, doesn\u2019t have the cultural impact piece, THOUGH the Roots are easily one of the most recognizable acts in hip-hop, especially as the backing band for Fallon. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re an unknown outfit. They have platinum and gold albums and six albums that opened in the top 10 on the Billboard pop charts, and 10 albums that opened in the top 10 of the R&B charts. Clearly, they\u2019re a band with a presence and are well-known enough to have an impact. Pretty much any outfit where rap is prominently featured out front and there\u2019s a backing band is following in their footsteps.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: If you ask any MC who their top MCs are, Black Thought is more often than not going to end up in that number. So his impact is felt and he\u2019s universally respected as one of the best to ever do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of it all? It\u2019s this: While I think everybody is aware of and knows that Black Thought is a great rapper, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten his just due in the conversations for GOAT. That Flex freestyle is a reminder why he should. If not for the pleasure, at least for the principle.\n\nBlack Thought is one of the best to ever do it; that\u2019s indisputable. Where does he rank on that GOAT list?

Maybe Bey wasn\u2019t doing her \u201cjob.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: GTFOH.]\n\nWith the appearance of writer and transgender activist Janet Mock as one of the \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d video, I couldn\u2019t help wondering: What are these same men thinking about Jay now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll confess that though I\u2019m a longtime fan of Jay-Z, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d Though Jay rarely has a misstep lyrically, the line \u201cLet me alone, Becky\u201d seems to completely place the blame for his affair or affairs on the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d rather than where it squarely needs to be: at Jay-Z\u2019s billionaire feet. In my opinion, it undermines the title track (\u201c4:44\u201d), where he actually apologizes and keeps the attention solely on his fuckboy behavior. So suffice it to say that when the video for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d debuted on Dec. 29, I wasn\u2019t too interested in checking it out.\n\nBut then I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s Jay. I got to.\u201d And I\u2019m happy that I did.\n\nTo start off, the choice to open the video with a quote by James Baldwin\u2014a queer black man\u2014is subversive in its own way. But then, when we time-travel to 2050 and the council of founding mothers, among the many famous faces, we see Janet Mock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting vibe when you watch a video intended to reveal a futuristic narrative about families feuding; I read the table of founding mothers as a collective of multihued women \u201csaving\u201d us from ourselves\u2014yet again. Some have expressed concern about the fact that there\u2019s no truly ebony woman at the table, which is an important conversation about colorism that needs to be addressed. And yet seeing Mock at the table as a fully participating part of the healing process made my masculine-of-center lesbian heart leap for joy!\n\nAs I replayed that section of the video, I wondered if Mock\u2019s inclusion was a result of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hand in the process, or was Jay giving a nod to us queer women\u2014cis and trans alike\u2014that yes, I see your womanhood? Hard to tell, but I\u2019ll take that win. Of course, that also means acknowledging the possibility of tokenism, which I\u2019m never in favor of.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that the entire video has moments that give us a wobbly understanding of futurism\u2014possibly Afro but certainly black American: a distinction that is important in the analysis of why it feels very American. For instance, the question of tokenism could also be raised when examining the inclusion of Native American actress Irene Bedard as one of the presidents in this futuristic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d beg to differ; for me, her appearance alongside Omari Hardwick was a reminder of the much-needed conversation that black Americans and Native Americans\u2014both of whom have been uniquely affected by colonization in the social project that is America\u2014need to have. It is important that they are sitting side by side, defending each other and having each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m going to optimistically err on the side of DuVernay\u2019s deft hand and say that tokenism isn\u2019t a part of Mock\u2019s inclusion. She belongs there because she is a woman. I hope Mock\u2019s presence among the founding mothers in this video signifies a shift away from the misogynoir and queer antagonism still present in contemporary hip-hop narratives. Maybe young men will take a note from an elder statesman and begin to understand their regressive ideologies.\n\nBut I can hardly see someone like black activists\u2019 fave Kendrick Lamar doing any work in this area. He can barely speak about cis black women in a positive manner, so I\u2019d be doubly surprised if he attempted to take on embracing queer and trans black women. I wondered as I watched this video\u2014do you have to get to almost 50 years old and out of the price range of Target runs to get some damn sense when it comes to love and womanhood?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find it telling that embracing queer women on an album where you are finally understanding that black women aren\u2019t the cocoons in which black men find their humanity feels like the next step in an evolution toward manhood. And when it comes to toxic masculinity and its relationship to womanhood, I\u2019m interested to see if Jay will, at some point, walk us through his understanding of the humanity of queer men as well.\n\nBut the presence of Janet Mock gives me hope. Not hope of acceptance\u2014that would just be empty rhetoric and truly a pitch to tokenism of the basest form. No, I hope that her presence is an acknowledgment of the personhood of queer folks. The ongoing murders of trans women\u2014particularly those of color\u2014speak to a deep and entrenched toxic combination of internalized racism and unhealthy masculinity that continues to inhabit our communities.\n\nIt\u2019s finally time for people to recognize that the most marginalized voices in the room\u2014those of trans women of color\u2014should be centered in our conversations when we are talking about getting free. Maybe our human family can stop the feuding over gender-identity labels and start thinking more broadly about what it means to be a man or a woman or genderqueer. That said, I\u2019m not going to label this video as a catalyst for that freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I am going to call it a start.", "keywords": ["jay", "feud", "women", "woman", "finally", "family", "makes", "trans", "tokenism", "major", "statement", "seat", "black", "jayzs", "queer", "belongs", "video", "im", "men", "table"], "polarity": 0.13311459667093473, "subjectivity": 0.527593896713615},

There is nothing wrong with not being able to dance. But we thought we\u2019d look at some of the more famous entertainers who\u2014despite their level of stardom and talent\u2014are stricken with what poet and amateur scientist Jonathan Samuel Eddie diagnosed as \u201crheumatoid Negroitis.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the list of the greatest nondancing entertainers:\n\n10. Rihanna\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not that Rihanna can\u2019t dance. Rihanna looks like she just doesn\u2019t give a damn about dancing. Rihanna is from Barbados, so anything past the dutty wine level of difficulty looks like she\u2019s just biding time until she\u2019s free to jump on a Jet Ski and hit the joint she keeps tucked in her bra.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, after you\u2019ve smoked half a blunt, every dance step feels like you are Fred Astaire. And Rihanna never smokes half a blunt. She always goes all in. That\u2019s why she\u2019s the queen.\n\n9. Johnny Gill\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen God handed out singing ability, apparently Johnny Gill got in line twice instead of waiting for his allotment of dancing skills. No one can impugn Gill\u2019s vocal chops, but he dances like he\u2019s the son of a preacher. There is no middle ground for preachers\u2019 kids. Either they can twerk like the Friday midnight main feature at Magic City or they dance like they have two left feet. Gill\u2019s gyrations will make you say, \u201cMy, my, my ... that nigga can\u2019t dance!\u201d\n\n\n\nIn defense of Gill, as one of the last holdouts to get rid of the S-Curl, the activator drips that surrounded him made doing the running man very precarious.\n\nGod, that brother can sing, though!\n\n8. Mary J. Blige\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love Mary J. Blige? It\u2019s not that the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul can\u2019t dance, it\u2019s that she\u2019s created her own genre of dance moves that is a mix of karate and being gone off the Henny.\n\nThe countless memes of people mimicking Blige\u2019s dances are always hilarious.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. P. Diddy\n\nSean \u201cP. Puff Daddy Diddy Brother Love\u201d Combs moves like he caught the Holy Ghost while a Junior M.A.F.I.A. song was playing. Unlike many people on this list, however, Brother Diddy Love seems to believe he is good at dancing, and\u2014to be honest\u2014he might be. Diddy always looks as if he just learned the dance routine in rehearsal, but when he gets all the steps down and memorized, he\u2019s going to slay it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe never gets it down.\n\n6. Whitney Houston\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe golden-voiced diva possessed one of the greatest set of vocal cords of all time. Like Johnny Gill, she didn\u2019t bother to bring her dancing shoes anywhere. With Houston, it didn\u2019t matter, because we all fast-forwarded through her up-tempo songs anyway.\n\nI actually do want to dance with somebody who loves me ... but not to that particular song. Plus, if I see Houston cutting a rug, it might get me out of the mood.\n\nWe will still always love her.\n\n5. Boyz II Men\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is another example of great voices who just didn\u2019t have it when it came to dance-floor charisma. Boyz II Men aren\u2019t supposed to be able to dance. They\u2019re supposed to stand in the middle of a field of dandelions and sing to a camera circling around them. They are supposed to stand on the beach in white linen and serenade the ocean breeze.\n\nSure, they might look like they just ate a family-sized bucket of Church\u2019s chicken before their performance, but as long as they\u2019re in tune when they sing \u201cEnd of the Road,\u201d no one cares if they\u2019re in step when they sing \u201cMotownphilly.\u201d\n\n4. Drake\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake is one of the worst dancers on the list. Heavy D rolled over in his grave when he saw Drake\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling\u201d video sullying the dancing legacy of light-skinned entertainers like Christopher \u201cKid\u201d Reid of Kid \u2019n Play, Chris Brown, Prince and post-Thriller Michael Jackson.\n\nDrake gets a pass because he dances exactly like who he is: an emo, half-Jewish Degrassi High child actor from Canada.\n\n3. Q-Tip\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ-Tip is one of the coolest figures in hip-hop history, but he dances like Frankenstein at the disco. It doesn\u2019t matter because A Tribe Called Quest is not known for dancing. He only made it this high on the list as a warning. There are men who look so cool, when they do something, you will sometimes mistakenly think the thing they are doing is cool. Please, I beg of you, don\u2019t go to the club on Friday night thinking you look as cool as Q-Tip when \u201cVivrant Thing\u201d comes on. You don\u2019t.\n\nAlso, why are you at a club that still plays \u201cVivrant Thing\u201d?\n\n2. Lil\u2019 Kim\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLil\u2019 Kim is the impetus for this list after a clip of a recent performance became a meme:\n\nI cannot confirm the rumor that Lil\u2019 Kim will replace Derrick Rose on the Cleveland Cavaliers roster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Mariah Carey\n\nMariah Carey doesn\u2019t even try. She sleepwalks through her show like she\u2019s high on Percocet and red wine. Mimi has so few fucks left to give that she is known to just say \u201cScrew this\u201d and let her backup dancers carry her through the performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if given the choice, which do we prefer: watching Mariah Carey zombie-wobble though the running man in 7-inch heels or hearing her hit those exquisite high notes?\n\nI admit that I\u2019m biased because me and Mariah go back like babies and pacifiers.", "keywords": ["music", "worst", "dance", "shes", "rihanna", "love", "looks", "dancing", "black", "dancers", "theyre", "sing", "look", "negroitis", "list", "rheumatoid"], "polarity": 0.16432659932659932, "subjectivity": 0.5259090909090908},

The current owner, Jerry Richardson, is going to put the club up for sale after reports of several payouts being made to victims of sexual misconduct came out via Sports Illustrated.\n\n2017 is definitely the year of getting creeps out of there. Owning an NFL team puts you in rare air. There are only 32 NFL franchises, so getting into that club is both exciting and difficult as hell. And white.\n\nWith the news that the Panthers are going to be up for sale, Sean \u201cDiddy/Puffy/Puff\u201d Combs (we will call him Puff in this article) posted a video and tweeted his interest in becoming the next owner of the Panthers. Steph Curry, a Charlotte, N.C., native, also wants in. Glory day.\n\nPuff is a very, very rich man\u2014his reported net worth is almost $1 billion (around $820 million)\u2014but the Panthers are worth an estimated $2.3 billion. Puff is going to have to put together a solid team of folks to make a reality where he could maybe be the primary owner.\n\nFor the record, I do think it can happen\u2014financially, at least\u2014but I wonder if the league would welcome the mogul to the table. All of that has to be sorted and worked out in the coming months. But for now, I can dream and shit. Here are 10 reasons that this needs to happen. The NFL probably doesn\u2019t even realize that it needs this to be a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. It immediately makes Charlotte a cooler place.\n\nLook, I like Charlotte just fine. It\u2019s a swell city. Lush and shit. Very nice foliage. The CIAA tourney is awesome, and I know some absolutely wonderful people from the city. A few years ago, Charlotte was supposed to become the next Atlanta. I think we can all agree that never happened. Puff immediately fixes that problem. LeBron went to Cleveland and folks looked at Cleveland like, \u201cYou know what? Maybe I should holler at Cleveland.\u201d Same shit. All kinds of famous folks might stop through Charlotte just to holler at Puff.\n\n2. Puff might single-handedly lift the Charlotte nightclub economy.\n\nPuff is no spring chicken, but does anybody think that this man couldn\u2019t (or wouldn\u2019t) go out partying seven days a week in a place like Charlotte just to find something to do? He\u2019d have to set up shop and roots down there and stay during the season at least, I\u2019m guessing. I\u2019m not sure if Puff ever sleeps anyway, so he\u2019d have to find something to do. He\u2019d stop at different clubs and food spots and spend all kinds of money, and his folks would do so, too. I\u2019m just saying, there is no nightlife downside to this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Ciroc everywhere!\n\nWhile I\u2019m a brown-liquor fellow myself, it seems like many of you still drink that white. We all know Puffy is the main marketer and promoter for Ciroc. Half of you think he OWNS it. He\u2019d mess around and turn Charlotte into the Ciroc capital of the world, taking that title from the Park at 14th in Washington, D.C., which has so much of the shit that I\u2019ve literally been handed free ENTIRE bottles on several occasions.\n\n4. Cam Newton could finally have somebody sit his ass down and get his fashion right.\n\nI realize this is No. 4 on my list, but we all know this is one of the biggest upsides. You remember how the current owner wanted Cam to stay straight-laced with no tats and shit. Well, maybe Puff would encourage Cam to get tatted up, and that might even out his style or something. Or maybe Puff would become the outfitter for all of the Panthers players or something. I don\u2019t know. But anything that helps Cam stop Cammin\u2019 it up fashionwise can only be seen as a net positive for not only the league but mankind. And if Cam is your fashion spirit animal, just fucking stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The games would be just as exciting for who might be there.\n\nPuff\u2019s box would be the most insane box of all time. I\u2019m talking DJs, good food and drank and celebs all the time. Random folks would come through on Sundays to attend Panthers games. Pharrell? Mary J.? Barack Obama? Who knows? The possibilities are literally endless because of the sheer number of people Puff has connections with.\n\n6. The Charlotte music market might get much-needed glow.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about Charlotte rappers. I think Big Daddy Kane lives down there, but I could also be making that up. Point is, every artist in Charlotte and the surrounding areas and into South Carolina would be trying to get to Puff, so they\u2019d all have to step their games up. But what if Puff decided to randomly show up at events and shows and look for some burgeoning new acts of any type? Lordt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Atlanta is a three- to three-and-a-half-hour drive, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s much quicker by private jet, and I\u2019m sure Puffy has access to one, but I don\u2019t, so I always drive.\n\nBruh. Atlanta would even catch some of the shine here. Puff could wake up and be like, \u201cYo, I want to go to Spondivits this morning,\u201d and be there on a private jet in, like, 15 minutes. NOBODY LOSES HERE!\n\n8. This opens the door for more opportunities for blacks in positions of power in the NFL.\n\nYou want to put the right football people in the right positions to win. But I think there\u2019d be a natural tendency for a black owner, especially like Puff, to look more favorably on qualified black applicants for jobs. What\u2019s better than one billionaire? Two. Especially when they from the same hue as you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Bruh, the halftime shows.\n\nLet\u2019s be real\u2014you and I BOTH know that Puff is gonna require himself to be part of the halftime shows at least once a season. At least. They might fuck around and catch a Super Bowl in Charlotte. Assuming they can get their inclusion policies together. North Cack is still North Cack.\n\n10. Most importantly, this would really test white folks\u2019 love for football\u2014IN THE SOUTH.\n\nCan you imagine\u2014and this is probably why it wouldn\u2019t happen\u2014white people up in arms at any changes Puff might want to make to anything? The racism and trolls would come out in full force, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to do shit because Puff is Puff and would be franchise owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear racist white people, (potentially) take that, take that.", "keywords": ["combs", "know", "carolina", "puff", "folks", "panthers", "charlotte", "think", "owner", "needs", "diddy", "buying", "sean", "cam", "im", "shit", "thing", "reasons"], "polarity": 0.10013413354322442, "subjectivity": 0.5288600288600287},

That title belongs to sentient-pile-of-shredded-Monopoly-money-lining-an-albino-hamster\u2019s-cage Jared Kushner, who has somehow managed to stay dead in the center of every Trump-related scandal despite the fact that no one knows what he does or did before whatever he\u2019s doing now, or even what he fucking sounds like. Shit, even though we know what he looks like, he\u2019s so indistinct and so aggressively \u201ceh\u201d that if you went to Trader Joe\u2019s tonight and saw him working there, you wouldn\u2019t think, \u201cWow. That cashier looks just like Jared Kushner!\u201d Just \u201cWow. For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness. So her visit to Parkland wasn\u2019t any more or any less useless than usual. Her uselessness is both hilarious and dangerous\u2014oh so fucking dangerous\u2014but it does have integrity. You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy.

For my money, few rappers could do what he did (pack that much substance into that many bars for that length of time and perform it so flawlessly) THAT well, and almost all of them are named Eminem or part of Slaughterhouse. I won\u2019t rehash all that he covered; that\u2019s been done already. But what has happened is that it should reignite a convo that exists in the rap community: Just where does Black Thought rank in the greatest-of-all-time conversation?\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve probably had a thousand \u201cWho is in my top five?\u201d discussions, give or take a hundred or so. At almost no time has Black Thought ever cracked my top five, which typically consists of Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Tupac or Ice Cube (AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted through Lethal Injection). There aren\u2019t any surprises on that list. It\u2019s a fairly standard \u201cmainstream\u201d list of GOATs.\n\nBlack Thought is as good as or a better rapper than every single person on that list. Yet he almost never makes my personal list, and based on the conversations I have, he typically gets left off a lot of other folks\u2019 lists, too, even extending them to top 10s. There are a few reasons why I think that\u2019s happened.\n\nFor starters, I think because he\u2019s part of such a great collective, the Roots, people sometimes forget to think of him in isolated terms. As an entity, the Roots are super beloved and appreciated, but we always lump them into one. Also because of their \u201cfirst hip-hop band\u201d image, I think sometimes Black Thought gets lost in that shuffle.\n\nWhen we think of the Roots, we think of Black Thought and Questlove, but we think of them in tandem and rarely of Black Thought as just pure rapper. Which is why I think every time he goes on shows and ends up spitting something, it stands out so much more. We are thinking of him as a solo entity in those moments, such as the Flex freestyle. Had Black Thought ever released a solo album, I think that might be different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he\u2019s been so consistent for so long, spitting at such a high level, that even when you are paying attention to him, it gets easy to overlook just how skilled he is. Which also gets back to him being lost in the collective, so to speak. They make music that often caters so well to his vocals that he sounds more like an instrument than an MC bodying a track. It\u2019s like D\u2019Angelo on Voodoo.\n\nThe most controversial of reasons is this: He sounds ... unexciting. He\u2019s not a sexy pick. I\u2019m a Black Thought fan, but that everyman-show-up-to-work-every-day-without-any-pizzazz thing tends to push him into the \u201cYeah, he\u2019s tight, but he don\u2019t really spark\u201d convo that people like Tim Duncan fell into. Duncan is the Big Fundamental; his game had very little razzle-dazzle or spark, so it was easy to forget you were watching one of the best to ever do it for so long. Of course everybody knows Duncan is one of the greats, but he\u2019ll end up in those conversations in a more interesting way now that his career is over.\n\nI think Black Thought is similar in that sense. Plain and simple, he\u2019s just that damn good. That freestyle wasn\u2019t a revelation for most of us who are familiar with the Roots. It was a super-skilled MC doing what super-skilled MCs do: They get nasty on the mic. For others it may have been an aha moment, and that\u2019s good for him, and hopefully it translates into new fans for him and the Roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the aforementioned reasons is particularly deep, but I think they are all relevant. Rappers in groups do struggle for that individual \u201cbest ever\u201d title, and it\u2019s usually when they step out on their own that we really start paying attention to their greatness. The catch here is that in the Roots, Black Thought has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting with assists from Dice Raw and Malik B., etc. Black Thought is primarily a solo MC in a band that we think of like a group.\n\nBut with freestyles like that one or any time he raps alongside musical guests on Jimmy Fallon or spits freestyles while on talk shows, you get the opportunity to appreciate just how special Black Thought is as an MC, IF he gets lost in the group shuffle. So here\u2019s the important question: Where DOES Black Thought rank in the GOAT convo?\n\nGlad you asked. For me? I think if Nas is in that convo, then so is Black Thought if I\u2019m being reasonable. I actually think Black Thought MIGHT be better than Nas, though Nas will always have Illmatic, which ensures his rap Mount Rushmore status for influence and impressiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggie will always be in my top five because I don\u2019t think there was a single weakness in his skill set, but I struggle with GOAT because of limited catalog, for obvious reasons. Jay is likely always going to be No. 1 because of how good he\u2019s been for so long and because of his cultural impact and footprint.\n\nBlack Thought, while being easily one of the most skilled rappers to ever do it, doesn\u2019t have the cultural impact piece, THOUGH the Roots are easily one of the most recognizable acts in hip-hop, especially as the backing band for Fallon. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re an unknown outfit. They have platinum and gold albums and six albums that opened in the top 10 on the Billboard pop charts, and 10 albums that opened in the top 10 of the R&B charts. Clearly, they\u2019re a band with a presence and are well-known enough to have an impact. Pretty much any outfit where rap is prominently featured out front and there\u2019s a backing band is following in their footsteps.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: If you ask any MC who their top MCs are, Black Thought is more often than not going to end up in that number. So his impact is felt and he\u2019s universally respected as one of the best to ever do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of it all? It\u2019s this: While I think everybody is aware of and knows that Black Thought is a great rapper, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten his just due in the conversations for GOAT. That Flex freestyle is a reminder why he should. If not for the pleasure, at least for the principle.\n\nBlack Thought is one of the best to ever do it; that\u2019s indisputable. Where does he rank on that GOAT list? Only time will tell, but he belongs on it.", "keywords": ["high", "rank", "rap", "goat", "band", "gets", "think", "hes", "mc", "black", "best", "thought", "doesnt", "roots", "list", "lists"], "polarity": 0.16205021211183182, "subjectivity": 0.480274232809444},

Another of those pivotal albums, Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic, was released on Dec. 15, 1992, exactly 25 years ago today.\n\nI don\u2019t think I heard any of this album until somewhere in 1993. I was living in Germany at the time, and we got a lot of music and movies fairly late. But I had a friend who used to make me tapes because he had the stateside plug, and a few songs from that album were on one particular tape. On a trip to Italy for spring break, I remember stopping on base in Livorno and buying the tape from the PX. Life was never the same.\n\nTo me, EFIL4ZAGGIN was the album where Dr. Dre became \u201cDr. Dre the go-to West Coast producer extraordinaire.\u201d The music on that album was nothing short of beautifully produced from start to finish. It\u2019s also one of the most ignorant albums in all of existence. There are actual odes to statutory rape. And nonstatutory rape. And murder. It\u2019s super homophobic. It\u2019s almost as if they set out to make the most misogynistic album they could make and refused to stop until even they were impressed with their own nihilism.\n\nA 12- or 13-year-old me was entertained and didn\u2019t really care, but a 38-year-old me can\u2019t even listen to it. No matter how sonically wonderful it is, the actual content is easily one of the most indefensible bodies of work ever created. I don\u2019t know how any of them played that album for their mothers, and I\u2019m not even joking.\n\nThe Chronic, released a year and a half after EFIL4ZAGGIN, continued in that same tradition but with a brand-new cast of characters, including immediate standout Snoop Doggy Dogg. But RBX, Nate Dogg, Jewell, Kurupt, Dat Nigga Daz and the Lady of Rage all held their own. The beats were extra banging, and the sound, man, the sound was gold. Dr. Dre knew how to make a record and knew how to make that record sound timeless. Even now, listening to the actual CDs I purchased in the early \u201990s, the sound quality is as good as anything mixed and mastered nowadays. Musically, The Chronic is top-notch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like a lot of albums coming out of Southern Cali during that time, the gangsta rap era, it\u2019s really hard to listen to it today. Back then, I was fully engrossed with West Coast gangsta rap. From Ice Cube to (especially) DJ Quik to Compton\u2019s Most Wanted to Lil Half Dead to Dogg Pound. If it was coming out of Los Angeles, I was typically all in.\n\nAnd almost all of the albums shared similar themes: house parties, weed, sex, violence, gangbanging, rape and rampant misogyny. It\u2019s actually impressive just how much rappers from Cali seemed to hate women. And yeah, I know, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about women\u2014we\u2019re talking about bitches\u201d was the refrain from ignorant fools near and far, but it was really hard to distinguish from their lyrics who exactly was who.\n\nNow, compared to EFIL4ZAGGIN, The Chronic is almost tame. Almost. While the violence and misogyny are still cranked up to a 10\u2014the video for \u201cNuthin\u2019 but a \u2018G\u2019 Thang\u201d is particularly problematic\u2014the constant rape, murder and dismissal of women isn\u2019t AS present. Hell, there\u2019s even a pseudo-introspective song in the Donny Hathaway-sampling \u201cLil\u2019 Ghetto Boy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s interesting. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve maintained a certain nostalgic appreciation for classic albums like The Chronic, but I find them very difficult to listen to. Don\u2019t get it twisted\u2014the album itself is every bit as good as it\u2019s always been. The songs are constructed well, the lyricism is great, the sequencing, the skits, everything. Plus, it gave us the \u201cdeez nuts\u201d gag that is as useful now as it was then.\n\nBut as I recently discovered, my ears are just different. I cringed at so many lines while listening to the album recently. My personal politics have adjusted toward less willful recklessness and more responsible thought processes, and that means that listening to 62 minutes of sex, murder and mayhem isn\u2019t as easy. And I\u2019d be lying if I said it was the gun or murder talk that bothered me; it\u2019s the misogyny. It\u2019s really hard to listen to albums that are built upon disrespect and violence toward women for no other reason than that they exist.\n\nWhen I was 13 and discovered The Chronic, it changed the way I listened to music, especially hip-hop. I was already a hip-hop fan, but it made me get into the actual art of creation. I was interested in the liner notes and the samples and who was involved in each record. I stopped being a consumer and started being an active engager. I started to really pay attention to labels and even engineers because any album this good, I needed to know everybody involved so I could go find other stuff from them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trinity of EFIL4ZAGGIN, The Chronic and (Snoop\u2019s) Doggystyle is why Dr. Dre\u2019s name rings out so much among producers, and those albums turned me into a producer guy. It\u2019s why I love the wave of \u201970s instrumental jazz-fusion albums. The Chronic is a memorable mainstay part of my musical journey for that reason; sonically, we just hadn\u2019t heard anything like it.\n\nBut just like the album changed the way I listened to music, over time, the music changed the way I listened to albums, and some I had to put on the shelf and appreciate from afar. The Chronic will always be one of hip-hop\u2019s masterpieces and will always be one of my favorites. Always. But sometimes you take a look at them, remember what they meant and why, and move on because the art itself belongs in the era in which it was first consumed.\n\nThat\u2019s The Chronic.

It\u2019s difficult to know where to begin, but the education community is buzzing about how little she understood Sen. Al Franken\u2019s question about the advantages of assessments in measuring growth or proficiency. DeVos didn\u2019t know she was walking into an area about which she knew nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she displayed her lack of understanding, Franken had to correct her as she tripped over herself until he finally had to say, \u201cThat\u2019s growth. Not proficiency.\u201d He continued on until he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about the debate between proficiency and growth.\u201d\n\n\n\nFranken continued, \u201cThis is a subject that has been debated in the education community for years, and I\u2019ve advocated growth as a chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nExasperated, the senator finally said to DeVos, \u201cIt surprises me that you don\u2019t know this issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducators understand the difference between measuring for growth and measuring for proficiency, and we know that those not in that space may not see how dire it is that the person who wants the position of education secretary have a cursory understanding of it.\n\nAs an educator, I spent 10 years as a classroom teacher and three more as a literacy coach at a middle school before I became a school administrator for 10 more years as an assistant principal and guidance dean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with all that background, I do not feel qualified to lead the Department of Education because I haven\u2019t yet spent time in think tanks or working with policy or in higher education, but that still makes me more qualified than Betsy DeVos. It should be telling that a person with two degrees in education knows enough to know that she wouldn\u2019t have the necessary background for education secretary, and yet that didn\u2019t stop Trump from naming DeVos.\n\nSeveral years ago, a family of 16 walked into the middle school where I worked. The school year was in full swing, but the father of the family needed to register four of those children in our school. The mother in the family had recently passed away and the father had no choice, according to him, but to split up the rest of the kids between himself and an older sister. When asked about the late registration, he told us they had \u201chome-schooled\u201d the children their entire lives. None of them had ever attended a public school.\n\nEven with all that background, I do not feel qualified to lead the Department of Education because I haven\u2019t yet spent time in think tanks or working with policy or in higher education, but that still makes me more qualified than Betsy DeVos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI use the term \u201chome school\u201d very loosely here, since it became evident that very little learning had occurred for these children. The father was guessing as to their grade levels (this was a major red flag for us) and suggested that two of the kids belonged in eighth grade and that the other two were in sixth and seventh. Our literacy protocols dictated that we assess them using basic reading measures, and when their grade-level assessments were too much, I went back a grade level until they could accurately read them back to me. One of the boys worked his way back to the kindergarten test (which I had to access from an elementary school friend) because he couldn\u2019t recognize all 26 letters of the alphabet. He guessed as I pointed them out.\n\nOnly the girl (the rest were boys) was able to read to me, and that was at the fourth-grade level because, as she told me, she was required to read recipes for the family, so she was one of the better readers.\n\n\n\nDeVos would know, if she were an educator, that this is an issue between growth and proficiency. She has not, however, ever worked in a school; nor did she or her children attend a public school, which is crucial, considering that she knows what\u2019s best for public schools and wants to rule over them with the job. Her background is as a billionaire philanthropist who has donated to or served on the boards of several charter schools.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf she were a professional in the field of education, DeVos would know that these nonreaders we had enrolled would take a state-mandated assessment and get a score that would affect the overall score of our school. She would know that enrolling them with such low reading levels meant that when they failed abysmally on those tests, we would take a hit from the scores because we measured them for proficiency, which is an arbitrary level the state assigns.\n\n\n\nWhat we wanted to do was measure them for growth so that the boy who didn\u2019t recognize letters in November would be able to do so by the next assessment. Teachers and schools want to measure for the growth we\u2019re responsible for so that there is a clear \u201cthis is where you are now\u201d compared with where students were when they came to us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchools get punished in the proficiency model, and that\u2019s no accident. Many proponents of charter and private schools like to see public schools listed as \u201cfailing\u201d because this fits into the narrative of education reformers who would like to make money off of children by removing them from the so-called failing schools.\n\n\n\nDeVos, with her limited charter school background, would know this is how you get them to fail, but she\u2019s not even up to speed with that. In a statement, she said, \u201cThe status quo in education is not acceptable.\u201d How would she know that if she doesn\u2019t understand the growth vs. proficiency debate?\n\n\n\nThis appointment will likely be disastrous for black students on whom many charter schools prey as they plant themselves in areas where they know desperate parents hope for an education miracle. A report from the National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that Betsy DeVos\u2019 own state of Michigan continues to have a gap in student progress between African-American and white students, significantly larger than the national statistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos\u2019 home state, over which she\u2019s been influencing charter school policy, is the fourth highest in American school segregation, a fact that discloses that she\u2019s already had an opportunity to make a difference in the schooling of black students and has done a dismal job of it. Why would we give her more oversight to include the other 49 states as secretary of education?\n\nBetsy DeVos is the wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing who plans to make money off of those children.\n\n\n\nWe really shouldn\u2019t cut her any slack on her poor interview skills, since this will likely be her very first job.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nKelly Wickham Hurst is a 23-year public school veteran as both a classroom teacher and an administrator in guidance, dean and assistant principal roles.

Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person.

But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself.

It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence.

DeVos has spent millions of dollars pushing to expand voucher programs that give families taxpayer dollars to pay for private and religious schools.\n\nDeVos, 58, has deep ties to the Christian Reform community in Michigan and is herself a product of religious schools. She graduated from Calvin College, a Christian Reform school named after Protestant reformer John Calvin, and as the Post reports, the DeVos name is well-known within the church.\n\nShe founded and serves as chairman of the American Federation of Children and its associated political arm, and she has used that platform to support candidates who endorse vouchers and charter schools. She also uses that platform to attack candidates who do not support vouchers and charter schools.\n\nTrump himself has proposed putting $20 billion toward federal spending for a grant program that would allow states to expand vouchers and charter schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Post, recent studies have shown that students who receive vouchers have seen their math and reading scores decline after they transfer from public to private school, while other studies show that voucher recipients are more likely to enroll in and complete college.\n\nAccording to the Post, DeVos\u2019 policy on school vouchers is likely motivated by her Christian faith, and Rabbi Jack Moline said that raises church-state concerns.\n\n\u201cAmericans are always free to send their children to private schools and religious schools, but raiding the public treasury to subsidize private businesses and religious organizations runs against the public trust and the Constitution,\u201d Moline said. \u201cIt suggests that he has little regard for our nation\u2019s public schools or the constitutional principle of separation of church and state.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulie Ingersoll, professor of religious studies at the University of North Florida, told the Post that DeVos\u2019 nomination is likely the handiwork of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who expanded vouchers as governor of Indiana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long-standing goal of the religious right to replace public education with Christian education,\u201d Ingersoll said. \u201cThe long-term strategy of how to change culture is through education.\u201d\n\nDeVos tweeted Wednesday that she is not a fan of Common Core and linked to a Q&A on her website that further explains her stance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am not a supporter\u2014period,\u201d DeVos wrote. \u201cI do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Post reports that many Republicans on Capitol Hill are hoping that DeVos will shrink the role the federal government has in public schools and leave more decisions up to the states and individual districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos did not initially support Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, and her family foundation donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation. In March, she told the Washington Examiner that Trump was an \u201cinterloper\u201d who \u201cdoes not represent the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nThat tune changed Wednesday after her nomination was announced.\n\n\u201cI am honored to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again.

Yo no s\u00e9.\n\nBut the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recently announced its 2018 inductees, a list that includes Nina Simone, Bon Jovi, the Cars, Dire Straits, Sister Rosetta Thorpe and the Moody Blues. A fine group of performers, some of whom you love and some of whom you probably hate. It\u2019s music and it\u2019s subjective. But their accomplishments are undeniable. In fact, inquiring why it took so long for all of those people to get in would be fair.\n\nAlso nominated but not selected for 2018? One James Todd Smith, better known to the world as LL Cool J. Including 2018, he\u2019s been on the ballot four times. How in the hell has he NOT gotten in?\n\nI realize that we don\u2019t care about Grammys or Oscars or Halls of Fame or any accolades, especially in hip-hop. Or so we say. According to Phife Dawg (RIP) on the song \u201cAward Tour\u201d from 1993\u2019s Midnight Marauders album, \u201cI\u2019ll never let a statue tell me how nice I am ... \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in 2017, Q-Tip felt a way about being snubbed by the Grammys. So even if we as a community pretend we don\u2019t care, validation is validation and acknowledgment is acknowledgment, and we all like it\u2014especially for hip-hop, which has had to fight and claw its way into being respected by the mainstream gatekeepers DESPITE being the predominant musical form of the USA and, really, the world. I mean, everybody loves Tupac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is not devoid of black artists. They ain\u2019t stupid. Artists from Sam Cooke to Gladys Knight & the Pips to Aretha Franklin to Bo Diddley to Jimmy Cliff to Bob Marley to the Jackson 5 to Michael Jackson all grace the annals of the Hall of Fame. And while I\u2019m sure there was a time when black artists struggled for that acknowledgment, we are all up and through there now.\n\nEXCEPT for the world of hip-hop, where, despite the genre\u2019s contributions to the WORLD, the only current inductees are Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, N.W.A and Tupac. A fine list of people who fit the criteria for the Hall of Fame\u2019s inductees: \u201cArtists\u2014a group encompassing performers, composers and/or musicians ... demonstrating unquestionable musical excellence and talent [who] have had a significant impact on the development, evolution and preservation of rock & roll.\u201d Obviously, the use of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll is the widest general definition, considering the various acts and individuals included therein.\n\nBut THEREIN lies my own confusion about the exclusion of LL Cool J. As a cultural icon and embodiment of everything the Hall of Fame exists to showcase, LL should have gone in when Run-DMC did, basically. As a solo act, especially. Every other act belongs there, but so does LL. While LL isn\u2019t the best at ANY particular realm of hip-hop, what he DOES have is the longevity tab on lock. We STILL know this man. He\u2019s still relevant\u2014maybe not as a musical artist, but for what you can do with your hip-hop celebrity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even musically, he gave us Mama Said Knock You Out, Mr. Smith and Bigger and Deffer. He has seven No. 1 rap singles. Four top 10 U.S. singles in a time before hip-hop was entirely embraced by the country. He\u2019s got classic songs and, more important, is the REASON so many of those early rappers even decided to pick up microphones. He\u2019s been influential.\n\nIn hip-hop, he\u2019s one of the most well-known stalwarts of the most famed hip-hop label that\u2019s ever existed. He leveraged his hip-hop bona fides into commercials, movies and television. He took hip-hop to the boardrooms and got that corporate money there. He got FUBU into a Gap commercial.\n\nHow influential does an artist need to be to get that recognition, IF we\u2019re recognizing artists for those reasons? I have no idea if LL Cool J cares. I\u2019m sure he would like to be inducted, since it is a great honor and at this point of his career, musically, that\u2019s about all he has left to accomplish. Maybe it\u2019s not that big a deal to him, but since he\u2019s been nominated, NOT being inducted must be a little annoying, especially on this fourth go-round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure that at some point he\u2019ll get in, as will artists like Jay-Z, Biggie, Puffy, Nas, DJ Kool Herc, DJ Premier and others, on sheer influence on hip-hop alone. I also think that Rakim belongs in there because he was YEARS ahead of his time and his influence cannot be measured even if he doesn\u2019t get universal credit for it. But it would be a shame for him not to get in soon, especially considering the other hip-hop acts that are in, as they\u2019re his contemporaries in the art form. Tupac is moving into the \u201990s. I can\u2019t see a world where LL doesn\u2019t make it, and I hope the Hall of Fame doesn\u2019t, either.", "keywords": ["hes", "roll", "ll", "snubbing", "cool", "hiphop", "artists", "world", "fame", "im", "hall", "does", "j", "rock"], "polarity": 0.1269675925925926, "subjectivity": 0.5079282407407406},

We saw some solid debuts and some great sophomore follow-ups. To be honest, there aren\u2019t many projects released this year that I can say I viscerally hated, but that won\u2019t stop me from complaining about some of this year\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed albums that I just couldn\u2019t go up for. So in the spirit of Festivus, without further ado (in no particular ranking order), here are five albums released in 2017 that I never, ever, ever have to listen to again.\n\n1. CTRL, by SZA\n\nI really wanted to like this album. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of SZA since her early Soundcloud EP days, and while I realize I\u2019m going to sound like such an unbearable hipster, I like her old \u201cunderground\u201d shit a lot better. I get why CTRL resonates so much with its intended audience; that aside, in comparison with her other projects, it\u2019s quite lackluster.\n\nThe indie-artist welcome-to-my-kitchen accent thing she\u2019s doing is way more exaggerated on CTRL than on any of her other EPs. It\u2019s so ridiculous, it almost makes songs like \u201cSupermodel\u201d unlistenable. She sounds like a melaninneal (melanated and millennial) Barbara Walters warbling about heartache and insecurity throughout most of the album. A real disappointment. I just listen to \u201cSweet November,\u201d \u201cCountry\u201d and \u201cBed\u201d instead.\n\n\n\n2. More Life, by Drake\n\nAre we calling this an album or a \u201cplaylist\u201d? It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it\u2019s going on the list. Like Views, More Life is more of Drake\u2019s new brand of global pop casserole that I DO NOT ENJOY. Do you know how it feels to be the only person who didn\u2019t instinctively wine their hips when \u201cPassionfruit\u201d came on in 2017??? Isolating. It\u2019s like being a Republican who believes in climate change. Even \u201cFake Love\u201d gets on my nerves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake has the vocal range of a dial tone, and while that may work on certain songs, I just cannot withstand a whole-ass project of his rhythmic humming and \u201cname that Diasporic accent\u201d challenges. The only thing I\u2019ve missed out on by avoiding Drake\u2019s music is being able to recognize when his songs are being referenced in dramatic picture captions on Instagram. I regret nothing.\n\n\n\n3. DAMN., by Kendrick Lamar\n\nDon\u2019t you just hate it when you can tell that a writer has no meaningful critique of a very popular and critically acclaimed album and can only offer shallow contrarianism? I don\u2019t know what it is, but every time I see K. Dot and his Black Israelite protective styles, my eyes begin to instinctively roll. Does this album have any other songs that people even like besides \u201cHumble\u201d and \u201cDNA\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the album that I imagine is gonna be played at that \u201ccookout\u201d y\u2019all keep inviting all those white people to for showing a modicum of human decency, and I\u2019ll be more than pleased to miss out on teaching Deb and them how to \u201chit dem folks\u201d to \u201cLoyalty.\u201d\n\n4. Drunk, by Thundercat\n\nIs it OK to admit that Donald Glover made a better Thundercat album with Awaken, My Love! last year? I realize Thundercat is not exactly a household name, but I felt obligated to listen to Drunk in the name of black artistry. Thundercat is the kind of artist that people who like to earnestly call themselves \u201caudiophiles\u201d name-drop. That being said, Drunk, while clearly thematic and purposely uniform in sound, was still a monotonous chore to listen to, and I\u2019d rather fold laundry than revisit it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. 4:44, by Jay-Z\n\nOK, I actually enjoyed 4:44 for three or four weeks, but months later the only songs I can still muster the interest to listen to are \u201cMarcy Me\u201d and \u201cBam.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that Jay is going on a \u201cYa know I cheated on my wife, right?\u201d public speaking tour and consistently dropping asinine gems and hot takes on every major media outlet known to man.\n\nJiggaisms on everything from marriage and financial investments to racial injustice are inescapable right now, and it\u2019s not because of quotables found on the album, but the narrative he needs to keep reiterating to sell the album\u2019s theme of introspection and redemption. 4:44 is a project that insists upon itself as a profound \u201cmoment,\u201d and Jay is not allowing the audience any room for inference. I\u2019m tired and ready for it to end.", "keywords": ["loved", "thundercat", "albums", "album", "listen", "know", "drunk", "songs", "ctrl", "444", "2017", "going"], "polarity": 0.0981569819069819, "subjectivity": 0.5516761016761017},

Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy. America has and even creates space for useless white people to survive and thrive.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told Trump.\n\nThe president called for stronger background checks, which for some ungodly reason the GOP and the NRA are against. Is this because it would make it harder for a certain section of America (read: bootleg dentistry and fat-tire-pickup drivers) to purchase guns at gun shows?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a gun show?\u201d you ask? Well, that is where people who have guns (read: tabacky-chewing, Hulk Hogan-loving Americans) sell guns to other Americans (read: mesh-hat-wearing, NASCAR-loving white men) with little to no requirements other than that said Budweiser-drinking American has the correct amount to purchase said firearm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to stop this nonsense,\u201d the president said. Trump then added that police should be able to take civilians\u2019 firearms without a court order, to which all of the GOP Congress members in the room began looking at their phones. Apparently the NRA sent out a mass text stating, \u201cFuck that shit! Someone needs to start choking to end this meeting!\u201d A few members coughed, but no one actually faked a full choking scene.\n\n\u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d Trump suggested.\n\n\n\nThe president then straight-up slammed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is pushing a bill to broaden background checks. Trump asked Toomey if his plan included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21. Toomey told the president it did not. To which the president replied: \u201cYou know why , bitch ? Because you\u2019re afraid of the NRA.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats might be spineless, but they aren\u2019t stupid.

Your activism has already impacted this country and will likely save lives. When I saw that Walmart announced that it would allow only people age 21 or over to purchase firearms, I was flabbergasted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit that I initially doubted how effective your efforts could be in the war against Murder Incorporated the National Rifle Association, mostly because I think NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre is actually a demon-possessed hobgoblin inhabiting the body of an incubus tucked inside a human exoskeleton that survives by devouring the souls of bullet-riddled babies, so I figured you\u2019d lose the stare-down because ... well ... I don\u2019t think Satan blinks.\n\nI figured, if a Newtown, Conn., elementary school full of dead babies didn\u2019t defeat the NRA, then no one could. But I was wrong! In my naivete, I forgot that the power of whiteness is the only thing more powerful than wheelbarrows full of cash that politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio are willing to accept in exchange for the corpses of high school sophomores. You\u2019re actually changing the world!\n\nBut now that it looks as if you are on the path to success, I\u2019d like for you to continue your efforts. Since it seems like America is much more willing to listen with an open mind when white kids say things, I have a list of five things we\u2019d like for you to put on your agenda when you\u2019re finished with the gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am authorized to offer you an unprecedented lifetime invitation to the cookout, excluding the annual celebration in Wakanda (I\u2019m sure you understand: T\u2019Challa issued an executive order that\u2019s essentially a white-people travel ban), if you are able to accomplish all five of these goals:\n\n1. Remember how black America acted after the Parkland, Fla., massacre.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder because ultimately, your cause will help black people, just as we believe that our fight against state violence and police brutality will also impact white communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice that black America didn\u2019t dismiss your efforts by asking about white-on-white crime? Could you ask your fellow Caucasians to note how\u2014every time someone mentions gun violence\u2014we don\u2019t bring up Parkland? Or Columbine, Colo.? Or Las Vegas? Or Sutherland Springs, Texas?\n\nCould they at least jot down how, whether we agreed with you or not, we simply addressed the specific issue instead of deflecting?\n\n2. Instead of Glocks, can we get some other stuff?\n\nIf they plan on addressing the gun control issue by arming teachers, we, of the black delegation, will pass on the offer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea. But when you look at black communities and the number of kids who have already died from gunfire, the fact that some teachers might have mental issues, the fact that some cops won\u2019t go into a school with a mass shooter but we expect teachers to do so, and the weirdness of my 11th-grade civics teacher, Mr. Heisman ... OK, maybe I am calling it a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really terrible idea.\n\nBut since black schools receive less funding than predominantly white schools, we\u2019ll take some books. A nice handgun costs about the same as an inexpensive laptop, and black students suffer from a gap in access to technology, so we\u2019ll take the laptops instead of the firearms.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this will make the world a better place, just think how lit Black Twitter will be!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you can force companies to change their gun policies, maybe you can force them to change other things.\n\nI was amazed that you convinced Walmart to change its policy on gun sales. In your next meeting, could you tell them to change their policy on how many cashiers they have working at one time? I\u2019ve been in Walmart on Christmas Eve and they still didn\u2019t have a cashier at every register, which might be worse than Republicans ignoring the fact that guns kill more Americans every year than AIDS, terrorists, \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and Shariah combined.\n\nDelta eliminated its NRA discount but still charges $30 to put my bag under the plane, yet it lets me stuff the bag in an overhead bin for free. It\u2019s on the same plane! How is this not illegal? And, like Wally World, airports never have a full staff of Transportation Security Administration agents. Half the check-in lines are never used!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear that America needs some commonsense line-control legislation.\n\n4. As long as we\u2019re working on fixing laws that kill people, we have a list:\n\nmarijuana prohibition\n\n\n\ncops being prosecuted by people who are essentially co-workers\n\nmandatory minimums\n\nstop-and-frisk laws\n\npharmaceutical-industry loopholes\n\ngerrymandering legislation\n\nfelon disenfranchisement\n\nFDA legislation that allows white people to make potato salad\n\ncapital punishment\n\n5. Can you never say \u201cAll lives matter\u201d ever again?\n\nAgain, I applaud your efforts, and would never try to denigrate the terrific work you have been doing. Ultimately, we are all on the same side: the not-getting-shot-in-the-face side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d like to point out that black and brown activists have been asking for these same proposals for years. We have spoken about the ease of buying weapons, about the lack of commonsense gun laws and how they disproportionately affect black and brown communities.\n\nEven when white America talks about black people\u2019s need to focus on \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d before we are allowed to address any issue slightly adjacent to racism, it never raises the prospect of confronting the terrorist organization known as the NRA. It never attributes the gun violence in Chicago to lack of mental health care or access to firearms.\n\nIt is obvious that dead black children like Hadiya Pendleton, who are gunned down on inner-city streets, are not worth as much as their white counterparts who die in suburban schools. But when white America reflexively responds to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with that bullshit about \u201call lives,\u201d could you point back to your laudable efforts and explain how the outrage over white lives changed the national conversation, the policies of international corporations and possibly the stranglehold of the most powerful lobbying group in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it might be true that all lives matter, this country\u2019s response to the loss of black lives has never been this vehemently loud and effective.\n\nNot like this.\n\nNever like this.\n\nP.S. While we understand that all of the victims and the activists werent exclusively white, we all know why the country is listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou do, too.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "control", "lives", "teen", "black", "ask", "activists", "efforts", "dear", "change", "things", "youre", "america", "walmart", "nra"], "polarity": 0.030929592959295947, "subjectivity": 0.43710042432814694},

Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part.

He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president.

Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4.

But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background.

According to the Associated Press, Ibrahim Gaidam, the governor of Yobe state, initially set the number of girls who were missing at 84, but family members quickly rejected the tally and issued a list of missing daughters, totaling 105.\n\n\u201cThis list did not come from the school management or any government source but collated by us from the parents of the girls,\u201d said Bashir Manzo, who is heading up the efforts to locate the stolen students. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, the governor is still being fed with fake information about these poor girls.\u201d\n\nFormer (but still my) President Barack Obama sent troops to Chad after the militant Islamic group kidnapped 200 Nigerian girls in 2014.

Trump\u2019s insults and \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies likely signaled to Boko Haram that the U.S. intervention that took place under Obama was probably not going to happen during the Trump administration.\n\nAnd now the newly emboldened Boko Haram has stolen 105 girls, thanks in part to the hands-off, shade-throwing Trump administration. When asked to comment on the missing Nigerian girls, Trump expressed his support by taking a break from excusing white supremacists, golfing at Mar-a-Lago and tongue-kissing the National Rifle Association\u2019s chapped, wrinkled balloon knot to say:\n\nWell ... we\u2019ll let you know when he says something.", "keywords": ["girls", "idiot", "nigerian", "donald", "troops", "country", "racist", "chad", "missing", "obama", "boko", "haram", "trump", "105"], "polarity": 0.09824464153732447, "subjectivity": 0.43283444198078336},

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent.

When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News.

His legislative failures may be notable, but they pale in comparison with the importance of how he is reshaping the judiciary branch of America\u2019s government at breakneck speed. Donald Trump is filling the federal bench with judges who are overwhelmingly white, \u201calt-right\u201d lite and have no idea what the hell they are doing, and it\u2019s the perfect guide to white supremacy in action.\n\nWhen Donald Trump touts his record number of congressional \u201cwins,\u201d he is lying. He has signed fewer significant pieces of legislation than any recent president. Conversely, the number of federal appeals judges whom he has appointed quadruples the number of appointees confirmed in Barack Obama\u2019s first year. Trump has sent 12 judges to the bench already, compared with Obama\u2019s four. George Bush only had six confirmed, and Trump even beats Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy\u2019s number of 11 appointees, according to Time magazine.\n\nWhat also sets Trump\u2019s nominees apart is their relative youth, inexperience and, most important, their whiteness. Federal appeals court judgeships are lifetime appointments, and the average age of Trump\u2019s nominees is 48 years old. Compare that with the average age of Obama\u2019s appointees during his first term, which was 53, Slate reports. This means that Trump\u2019s judges will probably sit on the bench longer, pleasing his conservative base.\n\nMany federal judges work well into their 80s, meaning that the new young judges could serve through seven presidential terms (when the Sasha Obama-Blue Ivy administration takes office). Tim Head, executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said thanks to Trump and Senate Republicans: \u201cThe federal judiciary is being reshaped for an entire generation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee how that works?\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, 53 of Trump\u2019s 58 nominees are white, and only one is African American. Trump has not nominated a woman of color. That stands in stark contrast with Obama, who made a point of diversifying the federal bench. Only 31 percent of Obama\u2019s first-year appointees were white men. More than two-thirds of Trump\u2019s appointees are white males.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we know that Trump has an affinity to mediocre white men, not only are Trump\u2019s picks white and young\u2014they are unqualified. A full 8 percent of Trump\u2019s picks have been rated \u201cnot qualified\u201d by the American Bar Association, a mark not seen since the 1960s, according to CNN.\n\nThis number includes Leonard Steven Grasz, who was confirmed to the 8th Circuit despite the fact that no judge with a \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating has been confirmed since the Lyndon Johnson administration. It also includes Trump nominee Brett Talley, even though he had never served as a judge, argued a motion or tried a case. And then there was Matthew Petersen, who did this:\n\nEven the nominees who are qualified adhere to the Trump clique\u2019s unique brand of diet racism displayed by Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions. Take Thomas Farr, for instance, whom civil rights leader the Rev. William Barber II called a product of the \u201cmodern white supremacist machine.\u201d Farr began his career working for segregationist and former Sen. Jesse Helms. While employed by Helms, Farr sent postcards to black voters warning them about voting illegally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarr has spent the last decade traveling around the country defending voter restriction and voter-ID laws passed by Republican legislatures. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said that North Carolina\u2019s voter-ID laws targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision,\u201d it was speaking directly to Thomas Farr. So what is Farr\u2019s punishment for losing that case?\n\nHe is the current nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\nDespite their shortcomings, racism and whiteness, Senate Republicans are confirming Trump\u2019s nominees at breakneck speed. The Hill reports that GOP lawmakers are considering a change to Senate rules that shortens the amount of time senators can debate a judicial nominee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does all of this mean for black people? It means that even if Trump is impeached or decides not to run, he may have inextricably changed the judiciary for the next five years. These changes are reflected in how justice is carried out across the country. Voter-ID laws were struck down by federal courts. A federal court ruled against his travel ban.\n\n\n\nI bet you\u2019re wondering why Trump would nominate someone to the bench who was as unqualified as these men. Especially someone as obviously incapable as Matthew Petersen, who was nominated to fill the empty seat in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Why does this matter to Trump and, more important, what does he receive in return?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, if the grand jury returns an indictment against Donald Trump, Jared Kushner or any of the people being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s FBI investigation, that case will be heard in\u2014you guessed it\u2014the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nSee how it works?", "keywords": ["number", "white", "quietly", "shows", "fight", "administration", "trumps", "supremacy", "winning", "bench", "works", "nominees", "federal", "court", "trump", "judges", "district"], "polarity": 0.08110957261692556, "subjectivity": 0.45513278796367035},

After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds.

This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

Since the age of 13, her love of beauty, business entrepreneurship, wanderlust and a hustle that just won\u2019t quit have made her one to watch. The Glow Up Girl caught up with the avid traveler and founder of Superstar Nail Lacquer to find out what inspires her, how she\u2019s nailing the beauty game (and several other burgeoning businesses) and where this entrepreneurial prodigy is headed next:\n\nAriana Pierce: When I was a young girl, my mom would get me a lot of books and Mary Kate and Ashley videos that had to do with travel: Passport to Paris, Holiday in the Sun and When in Rome, to name a few. I decided then that it would be a part of my career one day; I just had to figure out how.\n\nThe Glow Up: Traveling while black can be an interesting experience.\n\nAP: For me, traveling to South America, many times, they assume my friends and I are from a Spanish-speaking country or the Caribbean and will go out of their way to make sure we have a great experience. Of course, there are times when you have those people who are just rude. Don\u2019t let them ruin your fun\u2014you\u2019re there to enjoy life and take in the beauty of the world and culture around you.\n\nArianaPierce.com ArianaPierce.com SuperStarNailLacquer.com ArianaPierce.com 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What beauty essential would you never travel without?\n\nAP: I for sure take a bottle of Superstar Nail Lacquer with me, my diffuser and a small bottle of Thieves Oil. It\u2019s an essential oil that keeps my skin clear, and it helps to keep my immune system up.\n\nTGU: Favorite city for beauty treatments?\n\nAP: My favorite cities in the United States for beauty treatments are New York City and Los Angeles. Whenever I\u2019m there, I love visiting the spas, as people in these cities are very into self-care and leading healthy lifestyles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t been to South Korea, the capital of skin care.\n\nTGU: Favorite city for fashion?\n\nAP: My favorite city for fashion in the United States is New York.

It\u2019s all about creativity and owning your look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: How did your passions for beauty and travel become a business?\n\nAP: I started [conceptualizing] my business at 13. I wanted to help women everywhere feel beautiful, stylish and safe. Fast-forward to 17 years old: Freshman year at Michigan State, I wanted to launch myself in the beauty and cosmetic industries, so that\u2019s when I started. Being new to college and starting a business, I was always working.\n\nPhoto: Ariana Pierce (ArianaPierce.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Career highs and lows?\n\nAP: Lows of my career happened more so in my teens and 20s. I remember being in a room with people three times my age and feeling a bit out of place. Not only did age play a factor, but being a black woman in the cosmetic industry was something that was very new at that time.\n\nWhen I launched my online store at SuperstarNailLacquer.com, I did not post photos of me on my site so that people would not judge my product by a skin color, but by quality. I would get major calls from other brands wanting to collaborate with Superstar on some pretty amazing projects. It was disappointing to find that once these brands met with me in person, the deal went south for what they called \u201ccreative differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter so many times of experiencing disappointing outcomes, I decided that I would not let this stop me, so I began to study my industry, educating myself so I would know more than many of those I was meeting with. Over time, my business gained such success online; big brands couldn\u2019t ignore me any longer. One thing I learned from this is that no matter how others treat you, there is no room for excuses. If you put your mind, will and heart into your business, you can be successful.\n\n[My] career high was being featured on Forbes\u2019 Business of Influence series. Forbes is one of those things that had always been on my dream list.\n\nTGU: How do you manage to have a successful brand and a life at the same time?\n\n\n\nAP: It\u2019s all about scheduling time to do what you want and at the same time have a successful business. During the week, I make sure to grind it out in my business. I\u2019m flexible with my days, but I try [to] take Saturday and Sunday to spend with my family and friends. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been able to keep going without burning out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What are your business goals?\n\nAP: Continue to grow Superstar Nail Lacquer and sell it, but stay on as creative director while I focus more on my other brands, and also coaching young people to level-up in their businesses. I\u2019ve created courses to help people grow their brands online [and] start profitable blogs so they can live their dream life now\u2014not later.

She has become the de facto vessel into which we have all poured our hate for the Creamsicle-colored commander in chief.\n\nOver the weekend, someone dug up an old low-budget film of Omarosa clad in a red leather outfit, wiggling on-screen like an over-the-hill stripper having a seizure. The movie\u2019s resurfacing serves no purpose except to further embarrass the villainous Omarosa. It has since been removed from YouTube, and it is hilarious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut is it fair?\n\nSpoiler alert: We are all here for the Omarosa dragging.\n\nEven if Omarosa\u2019s cookout invitation was shredded when she decided to hop on the coattails of a white-supremacist-enabling dictator wannabe, are we being too mean? Omarosa is, after all, a black woman. Should she be kicked to the curb just because ... yada yada yada ... insert the overused phrase \u201cBlack people are not a monolith\u201d here and then finish the paragraph with something about \u201carbitrary, tribal definitions of blackness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are countless numbers of black people who have been willing to accept the role of a minion in the army of our oppressors. It is not incumbent upon us to be the better people in the rare instances when we get to witness a traitor receive his or her comeuppance. We should not be required to take the high road every single time. Reciprocity is not malice. It just is.\n\n\n\nMoreover, our giddiness over the plight of Omarosa isn\u2019t even about Omarosa. She is a medium into which we have channeled our disdain for a racist regime that seeks to place its foot on the neck of nonwhite America. She chose this.\n\nEven though no one can quite figure out exactly what she did as White House Office of Public Liaison communications director, whatever small role she played in the Trump administration means that she was an enabler of a regime that is blatantly anti-black. She was a friend of black America\u2019s enemy, which, by definition, made her an enemy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe accepted her $179,000-per-year salary and paraded around in front of black America as if she were anything but a sock puppet at whom the Trump administration pointed when they explained that they couldn\u2019t be racist because they had a black friend. She wasn\u2019t drafted. She was a free agent who freely decided to jump on the bandwagon of the team that excused white supremacist terrorists, traded in Islamophobia and used anti-immigrant sentiment to gain power. Now that the team has issued her walking papers and given her instructions on where she should avoid letting the doorknob hit, we should not feel sorry for singing, \u201cNa na na na, hey hey hey ... goodbye!\u201d\n\nSo don\u2019t feel bad about rejoicing over Omarosa\u2019s misfortune. Be petty. Laugh at her when you spot her at the unemployment office. She is the one who chose to stiff-arm black people and join the parade of white nationalists, xenophobes and \u201calt-right\u201d advocates.\n\nPeople like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele and others who have been banned from the barbecue festivities never had anything much to offer anyway. They were the ones who showed up to the cookout with store-bought potato salad and got offended when people talked shit at the spades table.

Kimberly Daniels, a Democrat, pushed a bill requiring public schools to display the motto \u201cIn God we trust,\u201d saying that while gun violence is a problem, \u201cissues of the heart\u201d need addressing as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is not a secret that we have some gun issues that need to be addressed,\u201d Daniels said on the House floor Wednesday, CNN reports. \u201cBut the real thing that needs to be addressed are issues of the heart.\u201d\n\nYes, Daniels, it\u2019s issues of the heart. That same motto is clearly printed on American currency, and it has stopped violence throughout the country (robbers have noted that reading \u201cIn God we trust\u201d on the money that they were stealing did nothing to stop them from stealing it).\n\nI don\u2019t want to make light of the terrorist tragedy that took 17 lives in Parkland, Fla., but I would like to make light of the lily-white responses coming from politicians since it happened.

It was also just a day after the state Legislature voted against a more commonsense measure to consider banning the sale of assault weapons.

Because, well, Florida.\n\nBefore the vote to include \u201cIn God we trust\u201d in schools, Daniels made an impassioned plea that included referencing the 17 students and teachers who lost their lives in Parkland.\n\n\u201cGod isn\u2019t Republican and he\u2019s not a Democrat,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not black and he\u2019s not white.

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},
{"url": "https://theglowup.theroot.com/on-target-black-beauty-1823342195", "title": "/on-target-black-beauty-", "text": "Target is fast becoming the mass-market hub for black-owned beauty brands. Customer demand for high-quality products with a luxury feel aimed at a black and brown audience\u2014ticketed at drugstore price points\u2014has been pent up for decades. This is in response to shifting demographics as much as customer needs; by 2028, the majority of Americans 18-25 years old will be people of color for the first time in history.\n\nThe flood of affordable, accessible and increasingly natural products aimed at black and brown consumers shows no signs of slowing on Target\u2019s shelves. This month, cult favorite the Lip Bar, founded by Detroiter and former financial analyst Melissa Butler, joined Target\u2019s roster of in-store offerings.\n\nThe Lip Bar\u2019s range of vegan, cruelty-free, deeply pigmented liquid lipsticks is just the latest high-quality, for-us, by-us product to land a spot next to cornerstone brands in the ethnic category, like Carol\u2019s Daughter (now owned by L\u2019Oreal) and Iman cosmetics (now owned by Procter & Gamble), both top sellers since debuting at Target in 2014 and 2012, respectively.\n\nAt press time, I counted 17 black-owned brands available at Target. Fourteen out of those 17 lines were natural-product ranges, a fact that reflects the growing concern among women in our community about moving away from chemical agents in our beauty routines, in everything from natural-hair products to lipstick to body lotions.\n\nIn conversation with The Glow Up, Melissa Butler says frankly, \u201cI am not passionate about makeup.\u201d Rather, she is passionate \u201cabout changing the narrative around the way black women are sold cosmetics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Butler realized was that no one was answering the question for the robust customer base buying natural-hair-care products as to where they could also buy natural or organic makeup brands.\n\nButler took a nontraditional route to sell her products to the popular big-box chain. With nerves and business acumen developed as a former Wall Street financial analyst, she contacted Target\u2019s cosmetics buyer directly. Big conglomerates control the color-cosmetics aisles; it\u2019s a near impossible feat for independent brands to get distribution without the backing of a L\u2019Oreal or a Procter & Gamble (backing Carol\u2019s Daughter and Iman, respectively) secured as an aid to initial entree into Target.\n\nBut even though Butler went directly to the store\u2019s buyers, there are no shortcuts to the front of the shelf when it comes to a multibillion-dollar retailer like Target. The Lip Bar has been available via Target.com since October 2016, proving itself through \u201cmessaging that sets us apart.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lip Bar speaks to customers through the use of nontraditional models and positive messaging that tells women they are already beautiful.\n\nAs Butler says, \u201cOur lipsticks add to their overall health and beauty, and we offer the highest-quality natural and organic products at about 60 percent less than comparable brands.\u201d\n\nPhoto: TheDoux.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtney Foster, a spokesperson for Target, spoke to The Glow Up about the growing family of brands directed at an ethnic audience, not all of which are wholly black-owned: \u201cThis winter, we launched more than 10 new brands, including the Lip Bar, the Doux, Urban RX and Koils by Nature, bringing our total multicultural beauty assortment to more than 100 brands.\u201d\n\nHow much is this market worth to Target\u2019s bottom line? Foster says, \u201cThough we cannot disclose sales information, we will continue to invest in our multicultural offerings and grow our assortment to include offerings that we believe will resonate with our guests.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated $46 billion beauty market in the U.S., of which black women account for roughly 22 percent of the total spend, that sales number has to be quite significant. Target is the third-largest retailer in the world, with 1,822 stores in the U.S. alone, as well as online sales, and a continued commitment to pledging 5 percent of net profits to charities based in the communities served by the retailer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is good news for the black-owned brands populating Target\u2019s inventory, as well as for our communities, as it has enormous potential to create positive cash flow back into communities of color.\n\nOf the 10 newly launched brands, there are a few standouts for us here at The Glow Up: The Doux, a natural-hair-care brand based on old-school hip-hop aesthetics is the definition of funky-fresh packaging\u2014Bonita Afro Balm, anyone? The line is aimed at everything from locs to perms, so you don\u2019t have to bounce around between product lines to get the the look you or your family might want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Koils by Nature blends bases of Jamaican castor and argan oils that double as hair treatments and body butters in unisex scents, providing a solution for the whole family to use in a single pared-down product line.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not black-owned, Urban Rx was developed with black and brown women in mind: It\u2019s a simple one-step makeup remover, cleansing mask and facial wash in a solid gel formulation.\n\nWhat do all of these products have in common?

Brunell has worked with Republicans in support of their gerrymandering efforts and believes that the census overrepresents black Americans.\n\nIn fact, Brunell wrote a book advocating the use of gerrymandering, Redistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections Are Bad for America, published in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Newsweek highlights, Brunell\u2019s appointment could imperil the rights of people of color in America. The business of counting everyone who lives within America\u2019s borders\u2014who they are and where they are\u2014is essential in informing state and federal voting districts, as well as determining how to distribute local, state and federal resources. A chief concern is that Trump would weaponize the census, using it to attack voting rights and immigrants\u2014and Brunell\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 implies that he\u2019d be happy to carry out his boss\u2019s marching orders.\n\nVoting rights advocates fear how Brunell could influence the undercounting of African Americans, especially given his previous work. The professor has opposed early voting, for instance, which favors black Americans as well as working-class Americans. The GOP has also used Brunell\u2019s reports or testimony in multiple lawsuits filed against them for unfairly redrawing voting districts on political and racial lines.\n\nIn his book on gerrymandering, Brunell argued that stacking Democrats and Republicans in like-minded districts leads to better representation from elected officials because it means that fewer citizens vote for the losing candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration also wants to add a separate question about citizenship that could dramatically reduce Latinx response rates out of fear that the feds would use that data to target them. A Middle Eastern and North African, or MENA, racial category has also been proposed\u2014a move that had been advocated by many people of MENA ancestry prior to Trump\u2019s election. Given Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim and anti-Arab rhetoric, though, it\u2019s likely that they, too, would be discouraged from reporting their racial backgrounds on the 2020 census because of worries about immigration crackdowns.\n\nAs with many other Trump government picks, Brunell is spectacularly unprepared to serve as the top operational official at the Census Bureau. He has no administrative experience and little experience with federal statistics\u2014both essential elements of the job. As Politico notes, the role typically goes to a nonpolitical career civil servant with a background in statistics. Meanwhile, Brunell\u2014gerrymandering\u2019s No. 1 fan\u2014is a registered Republican.\n\n\n\nBrunell\u2019s appointment does not require congressional approval and could come as early as this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Politico and Newsweek.", "keywords": ["overcounted", "pick", "thinks", "experience", "census", "professor", "trumps", "black", "brunell", "head", "rights", "federal", "racial", "trump", "progerrymandering", "voting"], "polarity": 0.09086229086229088, "subjectivity": 0.406016731016731},

Her job as a mouthpiece for the NRA is to shift the focus from looking at gun laws to looking at anything but gun laws.\n\nSeriously, she doesn\u2019t care if the focus goes from the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to the county sheriff\u2019s department, which she tried to accomplish during a CNN town hall. She doesn\u2019t care if the focus shifts to the FBI, the students or even the media, as long as it isn\u2019t on the NRA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s her job and she\u2019s doing it well. Because Loesch isn\u2019t just a paid talking head; she\u2019s a gun-loving nut, and I say this with all due respect.\n\nAccording to CNN, she\u2019s authored a book called Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America, in which she focuses on the history of the Second Amendment and explains what \u201cgun confiscation would mean to Americans\u2019 basic rights as citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd she even has a tattoo on her right forearm of a biblical verse from the book of Ephesians that is a call to Christians to \u201cput on the full armor of God\u201d in order to protect themselves from evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep.

You guys love it,\u201d Loesch said Thursday. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that you love the tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back [of the room].\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd notice I said \u2018crying white mothers,\u2019 because there are thousands of grieving black mothers in Chicago every weekend, and you don\u2019t see town halls for them, do you?\u201d Loesch asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s the CNN town hall for Chicago? Where\u2019s the CNN town hall for sanctuary cities?\u201d\n\nAt this point, it would have been nice if someone from \u201clegacy\u201d media had snatched the microphone from Loesch and ordered the entire CPAC evacuated so that Loesch could have had her choice of several seats.\n\nSeriously, the Chicago gun thing is just a tired cacophony of racist dog whistles the NRA blows whenever there is a push to change gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root staff writer Michael Harriot explored the Chicago gun issue in an article last year:\n\nWe know that crime rates in Chicago are on par with those of most major cities in America\u2014until you factor in gun violence. When they try to figure out why cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York don\u2019t have as many gun deaths as Chicago, they point the finger at gangs and \u201cthugs\u201d and ignore the elephant in the room: the state of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws. Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA. In fact, Chicago ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nDoing what?\n\nMoving away from the issue at hand and trying to prove a point that has nothing to do with the actual topic, which is that kids were killed in Parkland because an 18-year-old can buy an assault rifle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamn, she\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s how the NRA continues to shift the argument from guns to bump stocks. It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media. It\u2019s how the NRA makes a story about a mass shooter and how easy it was to get his hands on several weapons into a story about Chicago gun violence.\n\nDon\u2019t be tricked, America, and by \u201cAmerica,\u201d I mean all of us who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. This is a long con game that\u2019s rolled out whenever a shooting happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will say anything to take the focus off guns, and I know it seems low, even for the NRA, to argue that the media loves crying white mothers just days after a tragedy, but nothing is off the table when it comes to preventing Congress from changing gun laws, and this performance from the soulless and deranged Dana Loesch is proof.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "loesch", "gold", "mothers", "town", "shes", "love", "chicago", "shootings", "loves", "spokeswoman", "mass", "media", "ratings", "nra"], "polarity": 0.06412649850149849, "subjectivity": 0.4381139693639693},

Meanwhile, Esnard\u2019s creation, the Cut Buddy, provides the perfect guide for the at-home shape-up, working equally well for hairlines and beards.\n\nThese two smart inventions are riding the wave of the natural-hair movement buoyed by the flood of do-it-yourself info on social media platforms. The cultural demand for natural-hair products landed the two of them a feature on Shark Tank and verification as vendors on Amazon.com, the portal through which much of the world\u2019s retail now flows at an estimated $136 billion a year.\n\nCourtesy of ThePuffCuff.com @thecutbuddy via Instagram Courtesy of TheCutBuddy.com @thecutbuddy via Instagram 1 / 4\n\nToday, Esnard, 30, has a reported $700,000 worth of the online-sales revenue stream in partnerships with eBay and Amazon. The three-piece Cut Buddy kit retails at $14.99, yielding a hefty profit margin for its owner.

The letters, which come from the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division, have also found the prestigious university to be \u201cout of compliance\u201d with federal law.\n\nThe Justice Department is also threatening to sue Harvard if the school doesn\u2019t hand over documents it has asked for by Dec. 1. Harvard has said that it has complied to the best of its ability but cannot compromise confidential and sensitive student records for the sake of the DOJ\u2019s hunt.\n\nThe new documents confirm earlier reports that the DOJ was actively investigating complaints lodged against Harvard University by Asian-American applicants who claim that they were denied admissions based on their race. The suit alleges that Harvard uses a quota system\u2014a practice that has been ruled illegal\u2014to keep the number of Asian-American students relatively static year after year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conservative legal strategist behind the suit, Edward Blum, has had his sights set on blowing up a series of key civil-rights-era laws. Blum, who is not an attorney, successfully challenged the Voting Rights Act, though he lost last year\u2019s Supreme Court challenge to affirmative action against the University of Texas.\n\nNow it appears that the DOJ wants to take the suit, and the resentment of a handful of Asian and Asian-American college applicants, and dismantle affirmative action as we know it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanita Gupta, who led the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration (before the department felt like some terrible play at irony), told CNN that Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department \u201cclearly appears to be on the hunt for a case to bring a significant challenge to affirmative action.\u201d\n\nThe original suit, as well as the DOJ\u2019s obsession with Harvard\u2019s admissions practices, ignores several important factors. If Asian Americans suffered disproportionately, it would also mean that less worthy white applicants also benefited\u2014a fact that doesn\u2019t square with anti-affirmative-action rhetoric that focuses almost exclusively on black and Latinx students.\n\nAsians and Asian Americans are also disproportionately represented in Harvard\u2019s student body in comparison with their national numbers: Harvard\u2019s Class of 2021 is 22.2 percent Asian and Asian American\u2014the highest percentage ever for that group (African Americans make up 14.6 percent), according to the Mercury News. Asians make up 5.6 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore important, buying into the belief that Asian-American students disproportionately suffer because of their race implies that admissions applications between students are one-to-one comparisons. Simply switch an applicant\u2019s race, and suddenly the result changes! That view ignores how complex the admissions process has become, hinging on a variety of scores, qualifications, requirements and factors.\n\nLast year\u2019s Supreme Court decision alluded to this in the high court\u2019s defense of allowing race to factor into admissions decisions; it is but one of many qualities that colleges take into consideration when reviewing which students would be the best fit for their school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent report from The Atlantic highlighted this complexity. The city or town from which a student hails, his or her record of service, and whether the candidate is a first-generation college student or descends from a legacy of alumni all contribute to admissions decisions, yet there is little to no legal hand-wringing about how these factors come into play.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that recent studies indicate that Asians Americans, as a whole, have benefited from and support affirmative action programs. This isn\u2019t about protecting a certain group of students\u2014it\u2019s about using Asians as a cover to resurrect a white supremacist policy.\n\nAs this excellent NPR piece points out, white Americans have long used this myth of the \u201cmodel minority\u201d as a wedge to keep Asians and other people of color from seeking broader alignment and cooperation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs these documents indicate, the DOJ is ready to turn this wedge into a hammer.\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["documents", "suit", "practices", "race", "americans", "affirmative", "justice", "sue", "threatens", "harvard", "racebased", "department", "asian", "students", "student", "harvards", "admissions"], "polarity": 0.16241018931317433, "subjectivity": 0.4479196549718937},

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["massshooting", "check", "white", "teacher", "victims", "house", "school", "teachers", "care", "president", "going", "listening", "notes", "trump", "violent", "remember"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

But, Get Out is a lot less comforting, which is probably why it didn\u2019t win Best Picture last night.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s safety in distance. That\u2019s one of the things you realize when surveying creative work that touches on prejudice in American society. Recent Oscar-nominated films about the black experience like Malcolm X, 12 Years a Slave, or Selma have all had the buffer of decades or centuries. They still hold up a mirror that reflects a history of institutionalized racism but there\u2019s a thick layer of dust covering the reflected image, letting viewers say \u201cThat only kinda looks like us; things have gotten better.\u201d\n\nThe Shape of Water has that same dust on it. The period-piece stylings in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s movie are meant to invoke the timeframe when B-movie monster features were all the rage. That element also ties in neatly to the fact that blatant racism and sexism ran rampant during the Cold War era. Nothing about the movie\u2019s lush romanticism or softly lit happy ending makes the viewer think about the plight of society\u2019s outsiders in the present day.\n\nBecause it\u2019s in the here-and-now, Get Out doesn\u2019t offer the easy dodge of distance. Its central plot mechanic calls on a history of exploitation and injustice that\u2019s continuing to happen. Lured in by white people he thought he could trust, Chris gets treated like a resource: a body to be hollowed out and a soul to be discarded. Niceties are said about his talent but doors aren\u2019t opened; instead, the bidders at the Armitages\u2019 backyard auction want to possess Chris\u2019 skills for themselves rather than have him create his own successes.\n\nLook, I\u2019m glad that Get Out and The Shape of Water won their respective awards last night. It\u2019s not insignificant that The Shape of Water is the first genre movie to win Best Picture since 2004, but Peele\u2019s win for Best Original Screenplay feels like a safe consolation prize, something big enough to be meaningful but not heavy with the ultimate weight of Best Picture. When you factor in some of the attitudes and dismissiveness that preceded Sunday night\u2019s envelope-opening, it\u2019s not hard to see that this another case of Hollywood expecting a pat on the back for a half-measure.", "keywords": ["didnt", "win", "movie", "guts", "shape", "academy", "best", "things", "water", "thats", "outsiders", "picture", "racism"], "polarity": 0.2588293650793651, "subjectivity": 0.4331349206349207},

The protection is given to countries that have experienced political or environmental catastrophe such as armed conflict or natural disaster.\n\n\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it will terminate temporary protections for Haiti beginning Jan. 1, 2018, followed by an 18-month grace period. That means that nearly 60,000 Haitians will have until July 22, 2019, to leave the country they call home.\n\n\u201cThis is criminal,\u201d says Farah Larrieux of Miami. Larrieux came to the U.S. in 2005 and qualified for TPS in 2010. She says the decision by DHS to terminate TPS puts thousands at risk of losing everything they\u2019ve worked for and could separate families.\n\nHaiti was granted temporary protection after a catastrophic earthquake in 2010 killed more than 200,000 people and demolished most of the country\u2019s infrastructure. As part of TPS, Haitian immigrants are eligible to stay in the U.S., obtain work permits and send remittances to assist in Haiti\u2019s redevelopment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program does not offer a pathway to citizenship or permanent residency.\n\n\u201cThis is a issue of human rights,\u201d says Marleine Bastien, a social worker and executive director of Haitian Women of Miami, a community organization that advocates for South Florida\u2019s Haitian community\u2014the largest in the country. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about removing people and sending them into conditions that may put their lives in danger.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said, \u201cSignificant steps have been taken to improve the stability and quality of life for Haitian citizens, and Haiti is able to safely receive traditional levels of returned citizens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarrieux disagrees. \u201cHaiti is still suffering from a cholera outbreak and deadly hurricanes that struck in the years since. Plus, there\u2019s still political violence,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to send people with little or no connection to Haiti anymore back to the same dangerous conditions they were escaping from.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany TPS holders already have deep roots in their U.S. communities and play prominent roles as business owners, health care providers and service workers. According to the Journal on Migration and Human Security, there are more than 30,000 Haitian TPS recipients living in the country, primarily in South Florida. They are also parents to nearly 20,000 U.S.-born children.\n\nSeventy percent of Haitian TPS holders are employed, and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (pdf) estimates that losing their work authorization could result in a nearly $7 billion reduction (pdf) in Social Security and Medicare contributions over a decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe must protect our Haitian neighbors and friends because they are vital members of our communities and play an important part in our economies, especially in places like the Miami area in Florida and as I\u2019ve experienced with my constituents in Brooklyn\u2019s 9th District,\u201d Democratic Rep. Yvette Clarke of New York said in a phone interview prior to Homeland Security\u2019s announcement.\n\nAfter the announcement, Clarke called the administration\u2019s decision \u201ccruel and unconscionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did moral decency and compassion for others become a partisan issue?\u201d she tweeted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Clarke\u2014along with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)\u2014introduced bipartisan legislation, the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 (pdf), which would permanently resolve the status of the nearly 300,000 TPS recipients from Haiti, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central America. With the bill\u2019s passage, recipients who\u2019ve been in the country at least five years would be eligible to apply for permanent residency under a new protected status.\n\n\n\nHaiti and Central American nations like Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras are some of this hemisphere\u2019s most economically depressed, politically unstable and violent countries. These nations also share unique histories of U.S. involvement in their political and socioeconomic development that Bastien says cannot be ignored. The U.S. occupied Haiti between 1915 and 1934 and has played substantial military and financial roles in previous dictatorships and coups d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou cannot try to limit migration without taking responsibility for creating conditions that force people from their homelands in the first place. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d \u2014Marleine Bastien, executive director of haitian women of miami\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government aligned itself with a bourgeoisie that continues to exploit Haitians,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cannot try to limit migration without taking responsibility for creating conditions that force people from their homelands in the first place. You can\u2019t have it both ways. \u201d\n\nBastien says that\u2019s why many Haitian TPS holders are those who migrated even before the earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010. Some recipients fled violence and political instability years before. Bastien says that many of her clients have been in the country for decades and have American-born children.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRony Ponthieux is one of them. A nurse practitioner living in Miami Gardens, he and his wife qualified for TPS after coming to the U.S. in 1999 following an unsuccessful attempt to seek asylum. He says Haitians are the engine that keeps a lot of communities, especially underprivileged minority areas, running.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are living the American dream,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have houses, jobs, are providing for our families and sending money home to help our homelands rebuild. I don\u2019t understand how we can be deported when we are doing nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe pressure is on for Congress to reach a deal on legislation before the July 22, 2019, cutoff. For now, the most immediate fear for the thousands of Haitian immigrants is figuring out what happens next. Ponthieux fears returning to a country so dangerous it required him to flee, and he is faced with either becoming undocumented, moving to Canada, or uprooting his young daughter and teenage son\u2014both American citizens\u2014to a country they\u2019ve never known.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have never been to Haiti and don\u2019t know Haiti except for what they see on TV.

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A \u2018gun free\u2019 school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on: \u201cIf a potential \u2018sicko shooter\u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing.

But perhaps CoverGirl\u2019s latest ad, featuring model Amy Deanna, who has vitiligo, is the cosmetic company\u2019s freshest yet.

Kennedy was an explosive FBI report about civil rights leader and icon Martin Luther King Jr. Even though the report had nothing to do with the JFK assassination, the Trump administration included the newly unsealed dossier in a trove of documents released Friday related to the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination of Kennedy in Dallas.\n\nWhat is the document?\n\nCommissioned by then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the 20-page report is titled \u201cMartin Luther King, Jr.: A Current Analysis\u201d (pdf). It is dated March 12, 1968\u2014curiously, less than a month before King was shot and killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is in the report?\n\nLies.\n\nThe report is rife with falsehoods, speculation and disproven allegations about King, including his ties to communism and stories about secret orgies with prostitutes and white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did they think King was a communist?\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nYou know how today\u2019s incarnation of suspicious, fragile white-power brokers now label every anti-establishment organization a \u201cterrorist group\u201d? Well, in the 1950s and 1960s, the term \u201ccommunism\u201d shrank the collective Caucasian anus and furrowed white brows with fear, so every group of people who dared to speak truth to power was saddled with the label \u201cMarxist\u201d or \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, the report ties King\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the Communist Party USA, a small, marginalized group with no influence by 1960. The details of the document allege that King and the SCLC were heavily influenced by Stanley Levinson, a lawyer and businessman who financed the party for years.\n\nThe dossier tries to tie King to the Communist Party through Levinson even though Levinson had left the party years before he met King. It insists that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was related to a secret communist agenda without offering any solid evidence.\n\nWas King a communist?\n\nDidn\u2019t I just say the report was filled with lies? Are you even paying attention?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of explaining it to you, I\u2019ll just tell you what King told his trusted adviser Bayard Rustin in 1965 as King was crafting a statement announcing the unity of the civil rights organizations:\n\nThere are things I wanted to say renouncing communism in theory, but they would not go along with it. We wanted to say that it was an alien philosophy contrary to us, but they wouldn\u2019t go along with it.\n\nPart of the FBI\u2019s allegations of communism is fueled by King\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, which some translated as support for the commuinist Viet Cong. Some of it is tied to the fact that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was seen by some melanin-impaired capitalists as un-American. King\u2019s strategy of peaceful resistance is also closely affiliated with Karl Marx\u2019s belief in the possibility of achieving equality through peaceful revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that there were communists affiliated with the civil rights movement. Some of them were prominent supporters, but that does not mean that King or the entire movement for equality was a communist plot.\n\nSome of the people reading this article hold unspeakably heinous beliefs, like putting sugar on grits. This publication even employs people who commit un-American acts like giving trick-or-treaters candy corn for Halloween or putting ketchup in the refrigerator. Corey Townsend, The Root\u2019s social media editor, even confessed that he likes pumpkin-spice-related foods.\n\nBut none of these terrible acts means that everyone here at The Root is an evil, demented terrorist of taste buds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what about the sex orgies?\n\nJust say \u201corgies\u201d; the \u201csex\u201d part is understood. There aren\u2019t any other kinds of orgies, although I have joined friends at a certain Atlanta restaurant for what can only be described as a \u201clemon-pepper-wing orgy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysis from the FBI, King\u2019s associates held a workshop in 1968 in Miami to train a minister. The report states that some in attendance were disgusted with the whiskey drinking, homosexuality and fornication at the conference, including a sex show with prostitutes who engaged in activities \u201cdeviating from the normal sex acts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report does not say that King was present at this event but details affairs by King, including one with singer Joan Baez and an alleged love child with the wife of a prominent Los Angeles dentist. The single source for this information is a \u201cresponsible\u201d informant \u201cin a position to know.\u201d\n\nWhy does any of this matter?\n\nAgain, because ... white people.\n\nNone of this salacious detail negates the fact that King was fighting for the freedom or equality of black people. It does not dismiss the reality of Jim Crow, segregation, voter suppression, unequal housing, inferior education, state-sponsored terrorism or the unconstitutional, government-backed treatment of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reasonable explanation for any of this is that it was an attempt to discredit MLK and, by proxy, the entire civil rights movement.\n\nHow did they use this information?\n\nHoover and the FBI used it in a number of ways. The FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, tried to destroy the civil rights movement for years by casting it as a subversive, communist-backed agenda. The details in this report were ammunition for much of that FBI agenda. In November 1964, the FBI sent a letter to King telling him that it was aware of his extramarital affairs. The bureau threatened to release this information if King didn\u2019t commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank God J. Edgar Hoover is gone. Today\u2019s FBI would never do this again, right?\n\nCould you do me a favor and hold my lemon-pepper wing while I double over in laughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general who controls the FBI, is known for calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired.\u201d A few months after he took office, an FBI report leaked that characterized the threat from \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d as the new terrorist threat. Even the nonviolent group Black Lives Matter is often called a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d by members on the conservative side of the aisle.\n\nIf you believe that the day has passed when anyone concerned with justice or equality could be painted by right-wing zealots as evil, anti-American villains, just remember to turn on your television around 1 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon and watch the Caucasian crowd members boo NFL players for kneeling quietly during the national anthem, or read one of the many right-wing rags\u2019 desperate attempts to tie former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick to communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI dossier proves that Martin Luther King Jr. was the victim of a coordinated, government-funded effort to suppress the civil rights movement. President Donald Trump\u2019s release of the documents provides additional fuel for those who seek to denigrate anything black and outspoken because their history of complicity gives them the heebie-jeebies. Because they are too willing to believe that a civil rights legend was a communist and sexual deviant, but not that their dear, pumpkin-colored, pussy-grabbing president is a sexual assaulter. Because that would mean that they were on the wrong side of history for more than a quadruple century.\n\n\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["wanted", "know", "king", "jr", "white", "civil", "communist", "black", "kings", "fbi", "rights", "say", "report", "released", "luther", "martin", "trump", "liefilled", "file"], "polarity": -0.02562157287157288, "subjectivity": 0.4564069264069264},

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33.

You asked, and I got the answers on the best chemical peels and lasers for darker skin tones.\n\n\n\nDuring last week\u2019s \u201csnow bomb cyclone,\u201d I checked in with Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained New York City dermatologist, to talk about the latest offerings in her practice. As a black woman herself, she had plenty of advice to offer The Glow Up about using lasers and peels on melanin-rich skin.\n\n\u201cFor the darkest skin types, I like the Clear and Brilliant laser for resurfacing. I will also use the Fraxel laser with lower settings,\u201d Henry says.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used both of these treatments, and they do remove every line and every speck of discoloration on the skin. The doctor warns that the effects aren\u2019t permanent, though. \u201cA newer laser that is safe for all skin types is the Infini laser. It combines microneedling and radio frequency, so it tightens and corrects textural issues,\u201d she says.\n\nThis new generation of lasers allows the physician to tailor the treatment specifically to each issue on a patient\u2019s face, whereas previous generations of lasers obliged the doctor to treat the face with multiple processes. Including microneedling is part of that tailoring, using microscopic needles to puncture the skin, causing controlled wounding that stimulates the natural healing process and the production of collagen, which restores both radiance and elasticity to the surface of the skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor specific tightening and toning, Henry says, \u201cI love using the Aerolase 1064 Laser for skin rejuvenation and laser toning in darker skin types.\u201d\n\nDesigned to deal with thicker areas of the skin, this laser is helpful for acne scars, stretch marks, spider veins, keloid revision and fungal issues with nails, among other things. Scars can thankfully now be permanently removed, commonly in about two to four treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the best peels for African-American skin? \u201cMy go-to peels are the Vitalize Peel and VI Peel. Both are very effective but safe for all skin types,\u201d says Henry. \u201cThe VI Peel is a deeper peel, so I use it for hyperpigmentation and textural issues.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve personally used peels, and they\u2019re generally quick and painless\u2014with the exception of a few minutes of stinging or tingling, depending on your level of pain tolerance. During treatment, a small handheld fan is often offered to reduce the temporary stinging sensation. Peels takes about 45 minutes in total, and the downtime is 24 hours without makeup. I\u2019ve yet to try either of Henry\u2019s favorite peels, but I\u2019m about due for one. Once I do, I\u2019ll let you know what the doctor orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, living life brings the fine lines back over time; the better you treat yourself with diet, hydration and exercise, the longer the smoothing effect lasts.\n\nTry to avoid factors like alcohol, junk food and sleep deprivation in order to preserve your investment in any treatment. Sun exposure and hormonal changes can trigger the return of discoloration on the skin. And no matter our skin tone, we should all use products with sun protection factor because cancer\u2014including melanoma\u2014doesn\u2019t discriminate.

Rodriguez (Getty Images)\n\nWhen writer-director Jordan Peele won his Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 2017\u2019s biggest hit, Get Out, I cheered. When cast members of 2018\u2019s biggest hit so far, Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, walked the red carpet at the 90th Academy Awards, I swooned. And when I looked out at the sea of (mostly) white people attending the Oscars, I wondered, \u201cDid Hollywood learn anything over the past year?\u201d\n\n\n\nOn a budget of less than $5 million, Get Out made $255 million at the U.S. box office last year. Girls Trip, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, made more than $140 million in 2017. Black Panther is on pace to do $1 billion worth of business worldwide, reaching $900 million over this past weekend. Movie-theater owners know what\u2019s up: Films that are more diverse put up numbers. But does Hollywood know that?\n\nIn a show of amazing discipline, no one of note (so far) has written a story lately expressing shock that black movies are having a moment. Because, technically, this \u201cmoment\u201d has been a known thing since the \u201990s (Wesley Snipes\u2019 vehicle Blade made $415 million in 1998). Or at least since Tyler Perry took his chitlin circuit plays and made Madea mainstream with 2005\u2019s Diary of a Mad Black Woman. If a movie is good, or at least steeped in our cultures and traditions, someone will happily plunk down more than $10 to see the flick. And studies show that films with diverse casts make more money.\n\nBut you can know all of this, make all the money, get all the accolades and still have a career that never quite hits the stratosphere after an Academy Award, thanks to good ol\u2019 prejudice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalle Berry is a bona fide star with an Oscar for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball, and the most interesting thing I\u2019ve seen her in of late is a fitness-themed, quasi \u201cthirst trap\u201d photo on Instagram. Mo\u2019Nique has been pretty vocal about her post-Oscar life. And while Taraji P. Henson was happy to be nominated for an Oscar in 2009, she struggled to get work until Empire came along.\n\nI know how Hollywood works for white people, particularly white men. You get a real hit that makes real money and win some awards, and you get a blank check to do, create, write, produce or direct almost anything you want almost in perpetuity, even when you struggle to make another hit.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t expect director Ryan Coogler to win an Academy Award for Black Panther next year, but\u2014according to \u201cYou just made almost a billion dollars\u201d rules\u2014I do expect someone to whip out a blank check and tell him to go create.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Hollywood is supposed to work. Just as I expect all of Jordan Peele\u2019s film dreams to come true post-Get Out\u2019s success and his Oscar win Sunday night. Just as I expect Ava DuVernay to have a long and storied career post the Oscar-nominated Selma (and her new Disney film, A Wrinkle in Time).\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want to see is some Langston Hughes, \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\u201d mess where everyone\u2019s potential dries up like a raisin in the sun.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to be successful in film and television. Take it from someone with a failed TV show (or two) under her belt. But in a world where white men can fail upward until they succeed, black men and women who create, and are successful at creating, deserve the same opportunities, funding and support that, say, Zack Snyder or Michael Bay receive, despite the fact that they ruin most things they touch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, successful black creators deserve even more, since they have a proven record of success. But until the best of us are treated as well by Hollywood as the worst of them, Hollywood won\u2019t have learned this lesson: Diversity sells. Black movies and their success aren\u2019t flukes. And talent is talent, and you should reward it. Nurture it.

These interim final rules expand exemptions to protect moral convictions for certain entities and individuals whose health plans are subject to a mandate of contraceptive coverage through guidance issued pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe document notes that the new Trump mandate will not affect other federal programs that \u201cprovide free or subsidized contraceptives for women at risk of unintended pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe administration claims to be protecting people from being forced to violate their religious beliefs, while simultaneously ignoring and downplaying the fact that this will now make it harder for many women to get access to birth control.\n\nPolitico reports that women\u2019s groups are already moving to counter this change with lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told Politico:\n\nToday\u2019s outrageous rules by the Trump Administration show callous disregard for women\u2019s rights, health, and autonomy.

We will take immediate legal steps to block these unfair and discriminatory rules.\n\nIn 2014 the Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores that private companies could seek an exemption from providing birth control coverage on religious grounds. Politico found last year that in the time since that ruling, only 52 companies or nonprofits sought to opt out of the birth control requirement based on religion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, women saved $1.4 billion on birth control pills in 2013 because of the mandate, and about 55 million women have benefited directly from no-cost birth control.\n\nThis latest move by the Trump administration will undoubtedly have a ripple effect that affects not just women but America as a whole.\n\nAs the director of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Haywood Brown, told Politico, \u201cAny move to decrease access to these vital services would have damaging effects on public health and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you remove access to birth control while simultaneously making cuts to social welfare programs, how do all these children born unintentionally get taken care of?\n\nWhat is the endgame here?\n\nRead more at Politico and read the Trump document here (pdf).", "keywords": ["control", "mandate", "women", "womens", "removes", "obamacare", "cover", "administration", "politico", "health", "birth", "religious", "trump"], "polarity": 0.042842111592111584, "subjectivity": 0.4002585377585377},

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

It\u2019s been that way since I was a kid; now my daughters have those dry little white bumps on the backs of their arms and legs, too.\n\nIt\u2019s a harmless condition called keratosis pilaris, little white bumps that can resemble acne, caused by keratin deposits clogging the pores. About 40 percent of adults are affected by the condition, according to the Mayo Clinic. The effects of this chicken-skin-looking condition can appear more exaggerated in African Americans because we tend to have dry skin to begin with, making the contrast between the white bumps and darker skin more visible.\n\nBut never fear! Fat is the answer! I switched my family to natural soaps that are loaded with essential fatty acids. If you have sensitive skin\u2014or even if you just want your healthy skin to stay that way by avoiding toxins\u2014here\u2019s a guide on how to choose a good natural soap.\n\nAcid Trip\n\nLook for soaps high in alpha hydroxy acids and that are not formulated with water. Goat\u2019s milk, shea butter, wheat germ and hempseed oil are some of the most moisturizing fats used in formulating natural soaps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAHAs are particularly high in unprocessed goat\u2019s milk and raw shea butters, as well as more expensive oils, like the wheat and hempseed oils mentioned above (which also have a shorter shelf life). The lactic acid contained in these ingredients helps to slough off dead skin cells by breaking down the chemical bonds that hold dead skin cells together. It also increases cellular turnover. Water-based soaps remove dead skin, too, but the ingredients are often chemical and can do more harm than good by causing irritation, resulting in even drier and more sensitive skin.\n\n\n\nBring Your \u201cA\u201d Game\n\nHempseed oil contains vitamin A, which a lot of us know as retinol, the hero ingredient in expensive face creams that fights everything from fine lines to acne\u2014and is also good for the mild relief of psoriasis. Besides that, hempseed oil is one of the most quickly absorbed and least sticky of all the vegetable oils, so it\u2019s great for soaps and cosmetics. Water-based and chemically formulated soaps can be artificially fortified with vitamins, but most aren\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want my vitamins added to chemical crap. I want the real thing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreamy and Dreamy\n\nLet\u2019s get to the good stuff: These are my two favorite all-natural soaps, full of fatty goodness: Goat\u2019s Milk Stuff is a farm in Vermont that makes all of its products from raw, unprocessed goat\u2019s milk\u2014from cheese to soap. The soaps are chemical- and packaging-free\u2014a nice nod to keeping it green and clean straight down the line\u2014and the lather is divine. That\u2019s the kind of bubbly that\u2019s just right for a toast on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNubian Heritage Indian Hemp Soap is one of the coolest brands out there.

The FBI report was released on Aug. 3\u2014just nine days before a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign Policy obtained the report, which is marked for official use only. The document warns that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d pose a growing threat to law enforcement. In a particularly cruel and unfounded assertion, the FBI claims that police attacks on black Americans could spur \u201cpremeditated, retaliatory lethal violence\u201d against the police.\n\nFrom Foreign Policy:\n\nThe August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was the catalyst for widespread anger and violence, the FBI report says, concluding that continued \u201calleged\u201d police abuses have fueled more violence.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight. Because the response to Michael Brown\u2019s death was the first instance of black people voicing outrage about police brutality.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t specifically call out Black Lives Matter, the group certainly is the subtext of the document. As Foreign Policy rightly notes, 168 black Americans have been shot and killed by the police in 2017 alone. Law enforcement has killed 748 people in all this year so far.\n\nThat\u2019s 748 lives in less than 10 months, nearly a quarter of them black.\n\nMeanwhile, the report lists six total acts of premeditated violence against officers, including the shooting death of Dallas police officers at a BLM rally in July 2016. The shooter, Micah Johnson, wasn\u2019t affiliated with BLM but was reportedly \u201cinfluenced by BIE ideology,\u201d based on his journals and statements to police, according to the FBI report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move is the latest iteration of a long tradition of the FBI targeting and tracking black activists. The most famous example is COINTELPRO, which was created in 1956 with the explicit intent to \u201cexpose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist[s],\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s own documents. Then, as now, the people the feds are actually targeting were mostly activists fighting to advance racial equality.\n\n\n\nOr, at the very least, stop the government from ceaselessly, and with impunity, killing black people and people of color.\n\nEarlier this year, The Intercept reported that the FBI began investigating white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement in 2015. That classified document was crafted, notably, under the Obama administration, and warned of white supremacists\u2019 \u201chistorical\u201d interest in \u201cinfiltrating law enforcement communities or recruiting law enforcement personnel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did release a report earlier this year that warned that the white supremacist movement \u201clikely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year.\u201d However, the new guidance on \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d draws a dangerous equivocation between a movement that is seeing a visible resurgence and one that seems completely conjured by the FBI.\n\nAccording to Foreign Policy, this new guidance has raised eyebrows among the intelligence community, with one former official expressing shock at the report\u2019s contents.\n\n\u201cThis is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,\u201d the former official told FP. \u201cThere are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Foreign Policy.", "keywords": ["white", "cointelpro", "violence", "launches", "law", "extremists", "black", "identity", "20", "enforcement", "fbi", "targeting", "report", "movement", "foreign", "policy"], "polarity": -0.032507111935683376, "subjectivity": 0.4133005565862708},

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["speech", "mental", "school", "shooting", "took", "pretend", "dont", "shootings", "health", "cares", "president", "republicans", "listened", "thats", "trump"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

But, Get Out is a lot less comforting, which is probably why it didn\u2019t win Best Picture last night.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s safety in distance. That\u2019s one of the things you realize when surveying creative work that touches on prejudice in American society. Recent Oscar-nominated films about the black experience like Malcolm X, 12 Years a Slave, or Selma have all had the buffer of decades or centuries. They still hold up a mirror that reflects a history of institutionalized racism but there\u2019s a thick layer of dust covering the reflected image, letting viewers say \u201cThat only kinda looks like us; things have gotten better.\u201d\n\nThe Shape of Water has that same dust on it. The period-piece stylings in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s movie are meant to invoke the timeframe when B-movie monster features were all the rage. That element also ties in neatly to the fact that blatant racism and sexism ran rampant during the Cold War era. Nothing about the movie\u2019s lush romanticism or softly lit happy ending makes the viewer think about the plight of society\u2019s outsiders in the present day.\n\nBecause it\u2019s in the here-and-now, Get Out doesn\u2019t offer the easy dodge of distance. Its central plot mechanic calls on a history of exploitation and injustice that\u2019s continuing to happen. Lured in by white people he thought he could trust, Chris gets treated like a resource: a body to be hollowed out and a soul to be discarded. Niceties are said about his talent but doors aren\u2019t opened; instead, the bidders at the Armitages\u2019 backyard auction want to possess Chris\u2019 skills for themselves rather than have him create his own successes.\n\nLook, I\u2019m glad that Get Out and The Shape of Water won their respective awards last night. It\u2019s not insignificant that The Shape of Water is the first genre movie to win Best Picture since 2004, but Peele\u2019s win for Best Original Screenplay feels like a safe consolation prize, something big enough to be meaningful but not heavy with the ultimate weight of Best Picture.

Needless to say, we were eager to know what holiday makeup tips this face-making guru had to share with us, but as it turns out, Aunique\u2019s interested in making more than pretty faces ...\n\nInstead of talking about beauty, this beauty wanted to talk about ... beards.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that 2017 was the Year of the Beard; one need only ask the 1,751,033 members (and climbing) of the official Beard Game Matters closed Facebook group. But for those of us who have been longtime beard lovers, it\u2019s been a bit anticlimactic to watch the rest of the world catch on to what we been knowin\u2019: Beards are sexy as hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActually, let me clarify: Well-groomed beards are sexy as hell.\n\nAt the time of our meeting, it seems that Aunique had just gotten her well-manicured hands on a pair of brand-new Beard & Stache Balms by natural-skin-care company Anlea Essentials. She was eager to put them to use\u2014which she did, on The Root senior reporter Terrell Jermaine Starr\u2019s beard\u2014and a convert was born.\n\nThese shea-based balms also include natural oils and two memorable scents: Debonair Dude and Husband Material (hint, hint). And at $10 each, you can afford to see if he graduates from one to the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, SheaMoisture Men has been in the beard game for a while now, a fact they did not hesitate to remind us of during \u201cNo-Shave November\u201d 2017:\n\n@Glamazini via YouTube screenshot\n\nSince many of SheaMoisture\u2019s products are available at your local chain store, you could easily grab a basket or dopp kit and put together an entire grooming regimen for under $80 in one stop. How\u2019s that for last-minute gifting?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, as our own Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan recently warned us, behind every great beard is not necessarily a great face\u2014a phenomenon she calls \u201cbeard-fishing.\u201d This is why it\u2019s important to tend to the skin under that beard as much as the beard itself.\n\nOne of Camara Aunique\u2019s favorite skin and hair lines is legacy brand Kiehl\u2019s, which has been in the naturally derived beauty business since 1851, and for good reason. Not only does it sell a deliciously sexy-smelling beard oil using sandalwood, cedarwood and eucalyptus essential oils, but its men\u2019s skin-care collection is one of the most extensive on the market, with over 30 selections to choose from, available in most major cities and department stores.\n\nAunique\u2019s picks? Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer ($20) and Facial Fuel Energizing Tonic for Men ($18), topped off with Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24-Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer ($27). All three are great for fully bearded and clean-shaven men alike!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, here at The Glow Up, we believe that what\u2019s good for the goose is always good for the gander (oh, Sheila), so we\u2019re huge fans of black-owned unisex brand Oyin Handmade, created and run by wife-and-husband team Jamlya and Pierre Bennu. Their hydrating herbal-juice sprays are nourishing for all types of natural hair\u2014on the head and the face! And with gender-neutral scents like the citrusy Greg Juice, spicy Frank Juice and tropical Fruits & Berries (shoutout to Coming to America), these are as good a gift for her as for him.\n\nWe\u2019ve only got four shopping days left until Christmas, but you still have time to make a man\u2019s beard great again! While you might not make it in time for the 25th, you can certainly celebrate the new year by giving the man\u2014or men\u2014in your life the gift of grooming in the new year ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause we have a feeling this beard jones ain\u2019t going away anytime soon.\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: You might\u2019ve missed it for the holidays, but it\u2019s not too late to treat yourself!

I don\u2019t know about you, but the holidays are hard on my skin-care habits. \u201cJingle Bells\u201d are the death knell for my exercise routine; I eat whatever I want; I stay up late binge-watching Netflix with my husband (we like Peaky Blinders, and the kids got us into Lost). None of which contributes to my overall beauty regimen, but it does do a lot for my happiness. And I can tell you: Sometimes, fat and happy goes a long way toward getting a girl\u2019s glow up. Pizza for breakfast, anyone?\n\nThat said, when I don\u2019t fall asleep on the couch with my makeup on, still clutching an empty bag of all-natural Cheetos to my chest like a teddy bear, I try to get my beauty on before bedtime.\n\nRight now I\u2019m obsessed with the cult Korean beauty craze known as the Hanacure Multi-Action Treatment Mask. Honey, this mask will snatch your face back to a time when your biggest problem was trying to get your parents to let you stay out until 11 p.m. Hanacure is an all-in-one, deep-cleaning, tightening and complexion-brightening mask\u2014each treatment takes 30 minutes, and you do it at home.\n\nHow can this mask address so many concerns at once? The science is called OctoLift. Hanacure contains peptides for renewing a tighter appearance of the skin, and botanicals for brightening the complexion. You mix together a gelling solution and lifting serum, and apply it with the brush included with the kit. Just make sure you don\u2019t get it on your lips or too close to your eyes\u2014though, while you\u2019re at it, do put it on your hands! (Trust me, you won\u2019t be sorry!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGirl! Within a few minutes, you\u2019ll look like something out of the movie The Mummy. Warning: Do not watch a comedy or make jokes while using the product. Why? Like I said, this mask will snatch you good\u2014it gets rock hard, and trying to move your face is not an option until you wash it all off. The mixture sucks your face in so hard, it feels like it\u2019s cementing to your skin as it draws carbon monoxide from the air to activate the ingredients.\n\nAnd the results? Whoa! While it\u2019s just OK on hyperpigmentation, it\u2019s absolutely fabulous for correcting ashy skin, little blemishes and fine lines. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it\u2014check out what other people say on Hanacure\u2019s Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s so good that I suggest you skip the foundation and use the mask to get your glow on for that New Year\u2019s Eve party. The mask comes in a single treatment for $29, or there\u2019s a full treatment set of four masks that you\u2019re supposed to apply every other day, for $110. I haven\u2019t gone for the whole megillah yet, but if I keep up my couch potato regimen, I\u2019m going to need it.

A new report from BuzzFeed News confirms that the Department of Justice is investigating Harvard University\u2019s admissions practices. The investigation likely centers on allegations that Harvard\u2019s use of affirmative action discriminates against students of Asian descent, according to the report.\n\nBuzzFeed reports that the confirmation is based on Freedom of Information Act requests sent to the DOJ \u201cseeking records about investigations into admissions practices\u201d at two universities: Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While the Justice Department maintained that there were no relevant records related to UNC, the department told BuzzFeed that it could not disclose any Harvard documents because they were being \u201ccompiled for law-enforcement purposes,\u201d making them exempt from the FOIA request.\n\nWhen contacted about the response letter, the DOJ confirmed that there is an \u201cactive\u201d investigation at Harvard.\n\nThe confirmation signals that the Trump administration will forge ahead in its plans to dismantle affirmative action by claiming it hurts another minority group: Asian Americans. The news comes nearly two months after an internal Justice Department document was released indicating that resources in its Civil Rights Division would be redirected toward investigating and suing universities over their affirmative action policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Harvard investigation centers on a single complaint filed by 64 Asian-American groups in 2014 that claimed the prestigious Ivy League university discriminated against Asian-American applicants. The suit alleges that Harvard uses a quota system\u2014a practice that has been ruled illegal\u2014to keep the number of Asian-American students static year after year.\n\nBut at the center of the suit is a man who has had his eyes set on dismantling key civil-rights-era legislation: Edward Blum. The conservative attorney successfully challenged the Voting Rights Act, with the Supreme Court effectively gutting the landmark legislation in 2013. Blum also challenged the University of Texas\u2019 race-based admissions policies as being discriminatory against white students. The Supreme Court last year ruled against Blum and upheld the use of race in admissions decisions.\n\nNow Blum hopes to use Asian Americans as a wedge to dismantle policies that have broadly benefited people of color. In fact, data shows that the Asian-American community may actually support affirmative action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsian Americans Advancing Justice, a civil rights group, polled Asian-American voters last year and found that 64 percent supported affirmative action programs \u201cdesigned to help blacks, women and other minorities get better access to higher education,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nNicole Gon Ochi, an attorney for the group, pointed out to the Los Angeles Times that Asian Americans are not a monolith, and that affirmative action programs have been particularly helpful for \u201ctraditionally disadvantaged\u201d populations, like Southeast Asian and low-income Asian students.\n\nAnd a HuffPost article published earlier this year points out that data consistently shows that white students are frequently held to lower standards than their Asian-American peers in the college admissions process. Instead of focusing on this disparity, however, groups like those that launched the 2014 Harvard complaint have blamed black and Latinx applicants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Kim Forde-Mazrui, a law professor at the University of Virginia who specializes on race, told the Los Angeles Times in August, the Trump administration\u2019s feigned interest in protecting Asian Americans is politically opportunistic.\n\n\u201cThis is primarily about conservative leaders protecting the privilege of access to society\u2019s resources and opportunities for certain white constituents,\u201d Forde-Mazrui said, noting that white conservatives don\u2019t care about anti-Asian discrimination in other spaces.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see many of them concerned about discrimination against Asian Americans in other contexts, such as the \u2018bamboo ceiling\u2019 in corporate America, where such discrimination does not harm white interests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at BuzzFeed.", "keywords": ["white", "university", "americans", "affirmative", "justice", "harvard", "department", "asian", "asianamerican", "students", "probe", "action", "report", "admissions", "hit"], "polarity": 0.1296027976998126, "subjectivity": 0.3660859662725334},

That cashier looks just like Jared Kushner!\u201d Just \u201cWow. For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy. America has and even creates space for useless white people to survive and thrive. If this secretary of education thing doesn\u2019t work out, she could always follow the footsteps of other useless white women and maybe sue the University of Texas for not admitting her.

In fact, I\u2019ve been struggling with acne for the majority of my life. And as a soon-to-be a member of the Jackie Robinson Club (read: turning 42), my pimples were defending their reign, just as new fine lines started to etch themselves onto my face.\n\nAny product marketed for acne, I\u2019ve tried. Everything from Noxzema to acid peels, I\u2019ve used it. At the very best, some of these products worked for maybe two weeks. Most times, these products not only didn\u2019t work but made my acne worse. At the very worst, I had to resort to getting corticosteroids injected into my most painful pimples\u2014the ones that almost felt like welts underneath my skin.\n\nIn truth, this caused me to feel depressed\u2014it even jump-started my depression at times. And although I thought it was all in my head, as a psychiatrist, I also know that there actually has been a link found between acne and depression.\n\nMany frequent trips to my aesthetician and the dermatologist later, I discovered that prescription Accutane worked well\u2014but only after two different trials of taking the medication. And taking this medication also meant that I had to have monthly blood draws to make sure that my liver enzymes weren\u2019t elevated and that I wasn\u2019t pregnant\u2014since Accutane can cause birth defects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin the last year, things thankfully seemed to finally calm down a bit, but I\u2019d still notice that I would always get at least one large pimple right before my period. That\u2019s when I decided to give oil cleansing a shot. The oil cleansing method is a natural, organic method that has been around for centuries and has its roots in Ayurvedic medicine.\n\nPimples are caused by excess oil\u2014or sebum\u2014that the seborrheic glands underneath your skin produce when your skin needs more moisture or when they\u2019re overactive. As counterintuitive as it may sound at first, oil cleansing seeks to restore this balance by providing the oil or moisture that your skin needs, thereby reducing the amount of sebum that your glands are compelled to produce. In theory, oil cleansing should decrease the amount and frequency of breakouts. In my experience, it\u2019s been a godsend.\n\nIn keeping with the natural and Ayurvedic route, I recently stumbled upon incorporating turmeric masks into my daily skin-care routine. According to my aesthetician, celebrity skin expert Tina K, when applied to your skin transdermally, the turmeric in the mask calms down any inflammation that your skin may want to manifest\u2014and there can be a lot, since we\u2019re constantly pounded by environmental toxins day in and day out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result? On several days, I\u2019ve actually been able to leave the house and go to work without wearing a lick of makeup, aside from my beloved lip glosses. And for all of you who want to make sure you truly are what you eat, the best part about turmeric masks is that they\u2019re actually edible, and an ingredient you can use inside and out.\n\nWe\u2019ve extolled the benefits of honey before here at The Glow Up, and adding honey to my masks keeps my moisturized levels at their peak. An extra added benefit is that as a proud, bald black woman for the past 20-plus years, I find that applying honey-and-turmeric masks to my head after I shave has eliminated my razor bumps. (Take note, fellow baldies.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my experience as both a patient and a doctor, I\u2019ve always found that utilizing a combination of Western medicine and more-natural treatments has given me the best success when it comes to any conditions or ailments I might have. Acne can be a real pain to get rid of\u2014literally. But with a new year nearly upon us, it\u2019s always in your best interest to start thinking about new ways to let your inner glow come through so that the world can truly see you glowed up!", "keywords": ["oil", "masks", "skin", "adult", "actually", "winning", "best", "battle", "acne", "ive", "saving", "cleansing", "turmeric", "worked", "face"], "polarity": 0.18087235996326909, "subjectivity": 0.4287601993965632},

On Saturday the stars came out to celebrate the 33rd Annual Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. And we didn\u2019t come away disappointed.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Independent Spirit Awards honor the best independent films of each year. The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively.

Is she in charge of seasoning chicken?\n\nWell, apparently, she is a mixture of Rose from 227, Willona from Good Times and your cousin whose phone conversations always begin with, \u201cGuurl, guess what I heard!\u201d\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, White House chief of staff John Kelly has installed longtime aide Kirstjen Nielsen as his No. 2, tasking her with bringing order to a White House that has apparently been run like a bouncy castle at a 6-year-old\u2019s birthday party. One of Nielsen\u2019s first priorities is putting Manigault in her place.\n\nAccording to sources inside the cross-burning dumpster fire called \u201cthe Trump administration,\u201d Manigault had a habit of showing up unannounced at important meetings, sitting down and making herself comfortable. As assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison, Manigault is technically one of Orange Sherbert Stalin\u2019s numerous \u201caides,\u201d and had no business at many of those high-level meetings, but since she was unofficially Trump\u2019s Secretary in Charge of Black Shit, no one said anything.\n\nBut not anymore.\n\nSince the reality star obviously never learned the most important rule of friends with presidential benefits, the new White House let Manigault know that she can\u2019t just pop up without calling first. Nielsen sent out a \u201cStay in Your Lane\u201d memo to Trump\u2019s staff, and Manigault was the main Negress on the list. In describing her duties, the Times said of Nielsen:\n\nShe is also responsible for keeping Mr. Kelly\u2019s no-fly list of aides he deems to be unfit to attend serious meetings, the most prominent of whom is Omarosa Manigault, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d star with an ill-defined job and a penchant for dropping into meetings where she was not invited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManigault also was known for \u201ctriggering\u201d Trump by sharing negative news reports with the president. Manigault\u2019s gossip would reportedly infuriate Trump, causing him to stew about it all day. She allegedly shared MSNBC\u2019s negative coverage via his personal phone, which inspired the famously disgusting tweet about Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski\u2019s plastic surgery.\n\nNow that she has been deemed \u201cunfit\u201d to sit among the real decision-makers at the White House, the Apprentice star can presumably get back to the hard work of stepping and fetching for which she has become famous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["willona", "white", "house", "meetings", "star", "administration", "times", "trumps", "good", "houses", "apparently", "manigault", "trump", "omarosa", "york"], "polarity": 0.096601430976431, "subjectivity": 0.4521111411736412},

I\u2019m almost 40 years old, which means that I grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s listening to Common (n\u00e9e Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.) when he was rapping about watermelons and communism and asking to borrow a dollar. I still own a copy of his classic album Resurrection, which has his name listed as Common Sense\u2014you know, before the lawsuit that had him change his name to Common.\n\nThe Common I see today is a far cry from the rapper Common (Sense) that used to be part of hip-hop great debates; his GOAT potential was always on the table. His One Day It\u2019ll All Make Sense (my God, \u201cInvocation\u201d is perfect) and Like Water for Chocolate albums are indisputable classics. Be is a classic Kanye album (seriously, Kanye had the most memorable verse on the entire record, and the intro song \u201cBe\u201d is easily one of Kanye\u2019s best beats of all time\u2014fight me, bro).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Common from the \u201990s was still beefing with all comers\u2014remember, this is the nigga who beefed with Ice Cube in his prime and Louis Farrakhan intervened, and who also took shots at both Hype Williams AND Puffy at their height on the Roots\u2019 \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life)\u201d from 1999\u2019s Things Fall Apart album. Com Sense from the City of Wind was Chicago\u2019s answer to Nas, a street poet who participated in the culture he was helping to curate in real time. He was part of the Soulquarians collective, pushing the genre forward artistically.\n\nAnd then shit changed. Common went from being a rapper\u2019s rapper to \u201cGlory,\u201d a rap song for white people who read Ta-Nehisi Coates books. His albums weren\u2019t bad, per se, but his verses were less biting, less edgy, less memorable and more generally vague mixed with corny attempts at crossover success. Gone was the social commentary in favor of comments to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show in 2015 like this, via HuffPost:\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve been bullied, we\u2019ve been beat down and we don\u2019t want it anymore. We are not extending a fist and we are not saying, \u2018You did us wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m extending my hand in love,\u2019\u201d he said to host Jon Stewart. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the past as much as we can and let\u2019s move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we are going to try to help ourselves, too.\u201d \u201cMe as a black man, I\u2019m not sitting there like, \u2018Hey, white people, y\u2019all did us wrong.\u2019 We know that existed,\u201d Common said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to keep bringing that up. It\u2019s like being in a relationship and continuing to bring up the person\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m saying, \u2018Hey, I love you. Let\u2019s move past this. Come on, baby, let\u2019s get past this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, one could say that Common somehow stumbled into the sunken place, but that\u2019s not accurate at all. Assuming that the sunken place has something to do with access to or dating white women, that\u2019s not Common\u2019s ministry, for the most part. He\u2019s been linked with Taraji P. Henson, Serena Williams, Kerry Washington and, of course, the original knit-pants-procurement specialist, Erykah Badu. So what the hell happened? How does one of the most aggressive rappers whose entire M.O. was keepin\u2019 it real become hip-hop for white people?\n\nSimple. He secured the bag. And he found out what rappers who make a transition ALL say: Rap checks ain\u2019t shit compared with movie, television, commercial and \u201cWhite people love me\u201d checks. Common made it into television and movies, and even as a struggle actor in Wanted and Smokin\u2019 Aces, and an entirely unbelievable role as an NBA superstar in Just Wright opposite Queen Latifah\u2014another ultimate bag securer\u2014he was likely clearing more per film than most of his album royalty checks.\n\nThis man went from \u201cCom, I make righteous bitches get low\u201d to performing poetry at the White House to doing NPR Tiny Desks to winning an Oscar and several Grammys. He was a Gap model. He\u2019s in Microsoft commercials as the damn voice of Microsoft. Common figured out how to secure the fuck out of the bag, and his rapping suffered for taking a backseat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think any of this is negative. At least not for him. Common might not be a very good rapper at this point, but hell\u2014he used to be hungry. This nigga is eating now. A lot. When he wants to and where he wants. He went from British Knights to Balenciaga. When your drive as a rapper is largely tied to being underappreciated, lack of respect or anger at society, better circumstances and access to money and resources change shit. Then the angst subsides. It\u2019s hard to stay mad in Ferragamo slippers and sippin\u2019 Dom Perignon, or at least not that White Star!\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll bet Common laughs to the bank (or more likely laughs when direct deposit hits) every time he thinks about where he started and where he is now. He has made the absolute most of the hip-hop game. Folks reach out to him to do songs for major motion pictures that end up nominated for Academy Awards for the most vapid, boring, black-music-for-white-people bullshit (like \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d with Andra Day, which might as well have been called \u201cGlory-er\u201d), and they cut big checks.\n\nHell, I\u2019m wondering if he even tries anymore, and he still secures the bag every time. His latest album, Black America Again, even missed the mark despite its supreme timeliness. There were some familiar flashes of brilliance and very solid production. It just didn\u2019t have ... it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPretty much, he\u2019s dad rap now\u2014he is a father\u2014but he still has all the respect of the hip-hop community for past achievements in the inner-city hip-hop arts. White people can look at Common and say, \u201cI like that Common; \u2018Glory\u2019 was so moving and inspirational and really made me rethink that hippety-hop,\u201d and the rest of us just say, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s good to see him rich and shit, and at least we got Like Water for Chocolate.\u201d Common is out here being the change he wants to see.

Rodriguez (Getty Images)\n\nWhen writer-director Jordan Peele won his Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 2017\u2019s biggest hit, Get Out, I cheered. When cast members of 2018\u2019s biggest hit so far, Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, walked the red carpet at the 90th Academy Awards, I swooned. And when I looked out at the sea of (mostly) white people attending the Oscars, I wondered, \u201cDid Hollywood learn anything over the past year?\u201d\n\n\n\nOn a budget of less than $5 million, Get Out made $255 million at the U.S. box office last year. Girls Trip, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, made more than $140 million in 2017. Black Panther is on pace to do $1 billion worth of business worldwide, reaching $900 million over this past weekend. Movie-theater owners know what\u2019s up: Films that are more diverse put up numbers. But does Hollywood know that?\n\nIn a show of amazing discipline, no one of note (so far) has written a story lately expressing shock that black movies are having a moment. Because, technically, this \u201cmoment\u201d has been a known thing since the \u201990s (Wesley Snipes\u2019 vehicle Blade made $415 million in 1998). Or at least since Tyler Perry took his chitlin circuit plays and made Madea mainstream with 2005\u2019s Diary of a Mad Black Woman. If a movie is good, or at least steeped in our cultures and traditions, someone will happily plunk down more than $10 to see the flick. And studies show that films with diverse casts make more money.\n\nBut you can know all of this, make all the money, get all the accolades and still have a career that never quite hits the stratosphere after an Academy Award, thanks to good ol\u2019 prejudice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalle Berry is a bona fide star with an Oscar for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball, and the most interesting thing I\u2019ve seen her in of late is a fitness-themed, quasi \u201cthirst trap\u201d photo on Instagram. Mo\u2019Nique has been pretty vocal about her post-Oscar life. And while Taraji P. Henson was happy to be nominated for an Oscar in 2009, she struggled to get work until Empire came along.\n\nI know how Hollywood works for white people, particularly white men. You get a real hit that makes real money and win some awards, and you get a blank check to do, create, write, produce or direct almost anything you want almost in perpetuity, even when you struggle to make another hit.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t expect director Ryan Coogler to win an Academy Award for Black Panther next year, but\u2014according to \u201cYou just made almost a billion dollars\u201d rules\u2014I do expect someone to whip out a blank check and tell him to go create.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Hollywood is supposed to work. Just as I expect all of Jordan Peele\u2019s film dreams to come true post-Get Out\u2019s success and his Oscar win Sunday night. Just as I expect Ava DuVernay to have a long and storied career post the Oscar-nominated Selma (and her new Disney film, A Wrinkle in Time).\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want to see is some Langston Hughes, \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\u201d mess where everyone\u2019s potential dries up like a raisin in the sun.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to be successful in film and television. Take it from someone with a failed TV show (or two) under her belt. But in a world where white men can fail upward until they succeed, black men and women who create, and are successful at creating, deserve the same opportunities, funding and support that, say, Zack Snyder or Michael Bay receive, despite the fact that they ruin most things they touch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, successful black creators deserve even more, since they have a proven record of success. But until the best of us are treated as well by Hollywood as the worst of them, Hollywood won\u2019t have learned this lesson: Diversity sells. Black movies and their success aren\u2019t flukes.

That said, I occasionally get my fix by drifting through its virtual aisles and living vicariously through friends\u2019 shopping sprees, which is why I was eager to know what Yesha Callahan, deputy managing editor of The Root, scored on a recent trip.\n\nAside from second-guessing an impulse-splurge on cult skin care fave T.L.C.

Like fine wine or olive oil, the quality of the fruit as well as where and how it is harvested makes all the difference. Kopari\u2019s coconut oil is sustainably sourced from small family farms in the Philippines and made from fresh, virgin, and 100 percent organic coconuts.

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

There are dozens of contenders, but none that have ever truly stuck. Basically, the search for the perfect slur for white people has been like the search for a really good fast-food fish sandwich.\n\n\u201cCracker\u201d is perhaps the most famous one, as it\u2019s been around so long that there are popular modifications to it, most notably \u201ccracka\u201d and the sublime \u201ccracka-ass cracka.\u201d But these feel too retrograde, like one of those insults that seemed old even when it was young. It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows? Maybe a new contender will emerge. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought \u201cmayonnaise boy\u201d had potential.

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!).

Over the weekend, Dove\u2014the skin-care brand that is well-known in just about every household\u2014decided it would be a great idea to drop an ad for its soap on its Facebook page. The ad features a black woman in a brown shirt smiling and removing her shirt to reveal ... dun dun dun ... peak caucasity: a white woman in a creamish-colored shirt.\n\nHow?\n\nIf anyone knows anything about a little bit of American history, it is well-documented that soap companies pulled this exact-same racist stunt in the past, showing black people becoming white (aka \u201cclean\u201d) after using their brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople on social media were actually kind of shaken, honestly thinking that the Dove ad had to be a prank because, again, how is this happening in 2017? How did this even come on to an image board, let alone be published?\n\nOf course, Dove tried to apologize after it realized that no one thought its ad was even remotely cute, but the damage had been done, and actually, people are right to be fed up because, again, this isn\u2019t something you can really call an honest mistake. The optics are clear. The imagery has a history.

But fuck! The evidence was right there, and I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Which makes me wonder if I just naturally give white people the benefit of the doubt. Or women. Or, gasp, white women.\n\nGet Out, of course, was as essential to 2017\u2019s collective zeitgeist as any other piece of art. The film was record-breaking, the characters\u2014pitch-perfect archetypes of subtly problematic liberal whiteness\u2014iconic, and the sunken place is now a permanent fixture of America\u2019s cultural lexicon. Before Get Out, Candyman and cockroaches were the only things that scared me. Now it\u2019s middle-aged white women with teacups.\n\nAnd the ending, well. I remember the dread I felt when I saw those police lights approach Chris. There\u2019d be no possible way for him to explain the dead white girl lying next to him and the dead parents a few hundred feet up the road. This is where, even though I was watching it in a theater, the realities of our reality became too stark and too heavy to ignore. And an alternative ending to the movie, which I watched for the very first time last week, depicted that worst-case but terrifyingly plausible scenario.\n\nKeeping that ending probably would\u2019ve made Get Out an even better movie. It would have completed the Kafkaesque journey it took us on, proving that Chris\u2019 efforts were ultimately futile. The moment he agreed to visit Rose\u2019s family, imprisonment was the only outcome. His sense of choice had been relinquished, his fate determined. But as much as I appreciate movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d (well, movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d except for Funny Games, because fuck that movie), I think I needed Get Out to end the way it did. I think I wouldn\u2019t have been able to watch it again if it ended with Chris behind bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think I think these things because of when Get Out was released. I saw it a month after Donald Trump was inaugurated. And I think I hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the shock of what had happened in our country in the months before that. (For the record, I still don\u2019t think I have. I\u2019ve had more random aches and aliments in the last 12 months than I had in the last 12 years combined. I doubt that\u2019s a coincidence.)\n\nThe ending, at least, allowed for a brief exhalation, a minuscule but meaningful respite from the world we\u2019d return to when the credits rolled. America had just reminded us that we\u2019re all Chris. That we\u2019re all stuck on the Armitage compound, all surrounded by people who call themselves allies and spin themselves as friends, all aware that something is off but not quite able to articulate exactly what it is.

Bradford apologized for the comments at the time in a statement to the Post, calling them \u201cinexcusable.\u201d\n\nCNN also reports that in the comments section of a September 2016 article on the Daily Wire, a conservative news site, the Disqus account said to be Bradford\u2019s wrote, \u201cWell, it is a fact: Obama is the son of a fourth-rate p&*n actress and w@!re.\u201d The comment is an apparent reference to an unfounded right-wing claim that Obama\u2019s mother posed for nude photos, and perhaps a reference to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte calling Obama a \u201cson of a whore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen contacted by CNN on Monday, Bradford said in an email from his personal account, \u201cI cannot comment on an ongoing federal investigation into multiple cyber attacks and Internet crimes committed against me over the past several years, to include email intrusions, hacking, and impostors in social media.\u201d\n\nThe FBI and the DOE have neither confirmed nor denied the alleged investigation.\n\nAccording to CNN, this is not the first time Bradford has resigned amid turmoil over things he has allegedly written or said. In 2015 he resigned from his position as a professor at West Point after he wrote an academic paper that argued that the U.S. military should target Islamic holy sites as part of the war on terror.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["energy", "claiming", "controversial", "attributed", "doe", "account", "official", "result", "department", "email", "hacking", "cnn", "obama", "bradford", "resigned", "comments", "resigns", "trump"], "polarity": 0.04027777777777778, "subjectivity": 0.2256944444444444},

That title belongs to sentient-pile-of-shredded-Monopoly-money-lining-an-albino-hamster\u2019s-cage Jared Kushner, who has somehow managed to stay dead in the center of every Trump-related scandal despite the fact that no one knows what he does or did before whatever he\u2019s doing now, or even what he fucking sounds like. Shit, even though we know what he looks like, he\u2019s so indistinct and so aggressively \u201ceh\u201d that if you went to Trader Joe\u2019s tonight and saw him working there, you wouldn\u2019t think, \u201cWow. That cashier looks just like Jared Kushner!\u201d Just \u201cWow. For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness. So her visit to Parkland wasn\u2019t any more or any less useless than usual. Her uselessness is both hilarious and dangerous\u2014oh so fucking dangerous\u2014but it does have integrity. You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy. America has and even creates space for useless white people to survive and thrive.

Or perhaps she could be a rapper. The sky is the limit for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActually, that\u2019s a lie. Jared Kushner is her ceiling, because she\u2019ll never be more useless than he is.

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET to see conversations with Jordan Peele, Salma Hayek and Trevor Noah and Tuesday, march 6 at 10 p.m. ET for Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Yara Shahidi.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast. Now go forth and live your best life!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The best part was making my way into the official after party, which ended up being super intimate and Oprah literally greeted everyone there individually. And I got to take this picture with her.\n\n", "keywords": ["apollo", "shahidi", "shes", "supersoul", "brought", "fears", "oprah", "miranda", "dont", "harlems", "aligned", "peele", "conversations", "noah", "chakras"], "polarity": 0.2450367732625797, "subjectivity": 0.5730760950519015},

Yes, that\u2019s it.\n\n\n\nThe longer this disaster of an administration goes on, the more it feels as if anyone who chooses to work at the White House faces risks more akin to a rookie reality-television personality than to any political appointee. Usually, a political staffer may be ousted, but at the very least, they can keep their dignity, marriages and spines intact as they go pimp the speaker and TV-pundit circuit. Not so much with Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, no. You enter this bitch, and chances are you will leave with irreparable damage to your reputation. Of course, it\u2019s unsurprising that a reality-TV-star candidate for president runs his White House as if it were a reality show. And considering that 45 cares only about Twitter, various strains of prejudice, golf and yelling at cable news, I imagine that the man would much rather pit his staff against one another and let chaos ensue than read his daily briefs.\n\n\n\nBut at least reality stars walk away from national embarrassment with a new stream of income by way of a mixtape, liquor line, Instagram boutique or invitation to join the cast of the new season of WE tv\u2019s Marriage Boot Camp. What are newly departed fools of Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration leaving with? I almost feel bad for the newly fired fools, who signed up to serve a disloyal, lazy thot who ultimately plays the shit out of each of them. I say \u201calmost\u201d\n\nbecause when you sign up to work for white supremacy\u2019s equivalent of the D-League, this is what your ass gets.\n\n\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\n\nTo that end, let us begin with Anthony Scaramucci, who somehow managed the feat of being fired before he officially started his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal as communications director especially hilarious is that he was just talking cash-money shit to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all be fired by me,\u201d he said. \u201cI fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I\u2019ll fire tomorrow. I\u2019ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus\u2014if you want to leak something\u2014he\u2019ll be asked to resign very shortly.\u201d The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner because he hadn\u2019t been invited. \u201cReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,\u201d Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: \u201c \u2018Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.\u2019\u201d (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I liked Scaramucci, but I did find him entertaining. He also seemed like someone that, too, enjoys Deion Sanders\u2019 underappreciated bop, \u201cMust Be the Money.\u201d (Beyonc\u00e9 likes it, too.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite part of the New Yorker interview:\n\nScaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock,\u201d he said, speaking of Trump\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u201d (Bannon declined to comment.)\n\nSteve Bannon doesn\u2019t appear to be that limber, but I believe Scaramucci. Not long after this interview ran, chief of staff Reince Priebus resigned, only to be replaced by John Kelly, who immediately decided to fire Scaramucci over the New Yorker interview. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can say the choice to can Scaramucci was rooted in the vulgarity displayed in this now iconic interview, but it likely has more to do with Scaramucci getting too much attention. Lord knows 45 is more like Diana Ross and the Supremes than Destiny\u2019s Child after LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson left and the group made sure every single member got a solo on her songs.\n\nNo. 45 is the only soloist, and all his doo-wop pop pop chicks best not get too loud on the mic. Look what happened to the Mooch: He got too loud and was promptly escorted off the White House premises.\n\n\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we find out that Scaramucci\u2019s wife, Deidre Scaramucci, filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant. A source told Page Six, \u201cWhen [the baby] James was born, he sent her a text saying, \u2018Congratulations, I\u2019ll pray for our child.\u2019\u201d This same source added, \u201cShe\u2019s mad. They aren\u2019t really speaking right now. The [pain] runs deep. [Anthony] tells her she\u2019s not that smart, that he\u2019s out of her league.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Scaramucci was out here praising 45 as if he\u2019d nursed him at birth, he put down his pregnant wife while berating his new co-workers. Now he is single, sold his company for naught and has bragging rights as the shortest-serving incoming White House communications director in U.S. history.\n\nThere have been a few saying they feel bad for Scaramucci. Why? He\u2019s a soulless person who forfeited his beliefs, his marriage and his business in order to attain power. His pursuits led him to bend the knee to a con man who behaved exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, fool. You got exactly what you deserved.\n\n\n\nSean Spicer\n\nThat leads me to now-former White House press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer, who resigned in protest over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring. There are some folks asking whether Spicer will rescind his resignation in light of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Lyin\u2019 Spice knows that when you start singing freedom\u2019s song, you don\u2019t suddenly turn mute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather not see the likes of Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, but him dancing off the beat in a poorly fitting suit sounds a lot less humiliating than continuing to watch Lyin\u2019 Spice go on national television and yell at the press for not believing lies we all know even he doesn\u2019t believe. But if Spicer did take the job, that means Kellyanne Conway would seek a similar slot on a future season, so never mind. I\u2019m not sure what Spicer does next, but he would best serve what\u2019s left of his sanity if he left the White House while he still can.\n\n\n\nSpicer used to be an annoying Republican who toed the party line on the Sunday news shows like every other political hack. Maybe he even believed some of the nonsense he used to spew on TV, but as press secretary, he treated the truth as if it were the finest brand of toilet paper he had ever known, and all he got in return was his boss telling him he looked bad in his suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man got so stressed about daily briefings that he turned the cameras off to avoid further roasting from 45. The man made Spicer\u2019s job a living hell, but what\u2019s truly something is that Spicer resigned over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and ended up being right about him, yet both of them are on the outs. Insert laugh track.\n\n\n\nFarewall, Lyin\u2019 Spice. You got what you deserved, too.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nAnd then there is former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who, even after his humiliation, continues to whisper sweet nothings about that orange bag of stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cThe Final Humiliation of Reince Priebus\u201d:\n\nBut the White House is mired in chaos, and all that Republican power has yet to result in a single major policy achievement. Priebus\u2019s critics view him as the man who sold his party out to Donald Trump. Was it really worth it, I asked? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worth it,\u201d Priebus said, pointing to the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice, regulatory reform, and a healthy economy, though he acknowledged health care remained \u201can obstacle.\u201d \u201cThe president has accomplished an incredible amount of things in the last six months,\u201d he added. \u201cThe future can be great, and the past has been pretty good.\u201d Even in exile, he was still committed to spinning the Trump line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cdick too bomb\u201d? That\u2019s Priebus in this interview. I thought about saying more about Priebus, but if 45 decided to treat him like a \u201cnon-motherfucking-factor bitch\u201d for six months, why rock the boat (work the middle)? Next.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInitially, I was a little fearful of a retired general taking the reins of this White House as chief of staff. After all, the only bright side of this ongoing shit show is that as evil and vile as their political ideologies are, they\u2019ve yet to bring as much havoc to the masses because they\u2019re so bad at governing. In theory, the discipline of a military man might whip these suckers into shape. However, 45 is not going to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaddle Tan Nixon is going to continue being the same messy bitch who lives for drama that he\u2019s always been. As fate would have it, on the new chief of staff\u2019s day one of duty, the Washington Post reported that it was 45 who dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer last year.\n\nSo the characters on The Real Housewives of White Supremacy may change, but 45 is still the NeNe Leakes of the bunch, which means that it won\u2019t be long now before Kelly finds the nearest exit or is told that his services are no longer needed. It\u2019s also just as likely that Boy Wonder Kushner and the Favorite Trump Child will bypass Kelly\u2019s authority every chance they get to offer 45 either bad advice or advice like, \u201cDon\u2019t ban trans soldiers, Daddy,\u201d that\u2019ll only get ignored.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso: Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Steve Bannon\n\nIf I were current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, I\u2019d soon be worried about my sweaters, which are always wrinkled on television, or something else superficial. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 45 decided to eventually treat her the way her brother did that family pet of theirs (since she wants to talk about morality). She may be confidently condescending when speaking to reports, but all she does is stand there and essentially say, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the president about that.\u201d That\u2019s going to get old fast for 45, who prefers his lies with remixes (real remixes like you heard in the 1990s, not the bullshit these children get now).\n\n\n\nLastly, if I were chief strategist Steve Bannon, I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable sitting in my chair (and, I don\u2019t know, sucking my own cock?). Yes, you\u2019re the key to his base, Grand Wizard, but haven\u2019t you already been threatened with firing before? No. 45 gon\u2019 get rid of you in due time, too. He\u2019ll just snuggle next to Sinclair Broadcasting soon after.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep laughing at all of them because it\u2019s the only way to deal with the reality that we\u2019re having to suffer with this incredibly terrible American remake of King Ralph solely because white folks wanted to feel good about being white again. #MAGA.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "45", "priebus", "house", "chief", "scaramuccis", "turned", "real", "man", "supremacy", "scaramucci", "president", "im", "spicer", "yalls", "housewives"], "polarity": 0.05056435958221671, "subjectivity": 0.4611590393733249},

Shit, even though we know what he looks like, he\u2019s so indistinct and so aggressively \u201ceh\u201d that if you went to Trader Joe\u2019s tonight and saw him working there, you wouldn\u2019t think, \u201cWow. That cashier looks just like Jared Kushner!\u201d Just \u201cWow. For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness. So her visit to Parkland wasn\u2019t any more or any less useless than usual. Her uselessness is both hilarious and dangerous\u2014oh so fucking dangerous\u2014but it does have integrity. You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy. America has and even creates space for useless white people to survive and thrive. If this secretary of education thing doesn\u2019t work out, she could always follow the footsteps of other useless white women and maybe sue the University of Texas for not admitting her. Or perhaps she could be a rapper. The sky is the limit for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActually, that\u2019s a lie. Jared Kushner is her ceiling, because she\u2019ll never be more useless than he is.

Like, we may have to come up with a concept stronger than #Goals to explain how we feel about her.\n\n\n\nWhen the 17-year-old shining star stepped on that SAG Awards red carpet, we collectively gasped\u2014and haven\u2019t taken a breath since. She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup.

The Washington Post published the letter Trump\u2019s counsel sent to the book\u2019s author, Michael Wolff. If you don\u2019t feel like reading all 11 pages, here\u2019s the gist:\n\nImmediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book.\n\nThe law firm also claims that Wolff made \u201cnumerous false and/or baseless statements\u201d about Trump, and the lawyers are considering pursuing libel charges.\n\nThankfully for those of us who can\u2019t get enough of any reports bashing this Cleveland Browns-ass administration, several news outlets have already received advance copies of the book.

(If you haven\u2019t already, join The Glow Up Facebook group to participate in a live red-carpet roundup with us at 6:45 p.m. EST.)\n\nBut in a season full of honors and awards shows, we have a special place in our hearts for the one with an independent streak. On Saturday the stars came out to celebrate the 33rd Annual Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. And we didn\u2019t come away disappointed.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Independent Spirit Awards honor the best independent films of each year. The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director. Rees gave an incredible speech that drove home the fact that, in her words, \u201cMudbound is cinema.\u201d\n\n\n\nFilm Independent via YouTube\n\nBut perhaps our favorite aspect of the Independent Spirit Awards is how fully it lives up to its name. In contrast to the formality of the Academy Awards, the independent spirit is alive and well at this awards ceremony, and the stars revel in it. Even the step-and-repeat has a dynamically different quality as celebs pose for candid portraits, rather than typical paparazzi shots. Here are some of our favorites who were in attendance yesterday\u2014we only wish we were, too!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["awards", "stars", "biggest", "director", "films", "independent", "academy", "spirit", "celebrate", "best", "streak"], "polarity": 0.26517999544315335, "subjectivity": 0.49793233082706767},

What was different in 2017, more so than any other year in recent memory, was how those polarities were laid bare for everyone else to see.\n\n\n\nIt was the year American streets were crowded with both pussy hats and neo-Nazis. It was the year Confederate monuments were torn from their bases and irate NFL fans cursed at their TVs as black players kneeled en masse. Both \u201ccomplicit\u201d and \u201cfeminism\u201d were designated \u201cwords of the year\u201d (the first by Dictionary.com, the second by Merriam-Webster\u2019s) in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a year that saw the careers of dozens of the world\u2019s most powerful men crash and burn while a man accused of multiple instances of sexual abuse continued to tweet from the Oval Office. It was the year a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. It was the year an alleged pedophile was endorsed by the most powerful man in the free world.\n\nLooking back on the year, no one work sums up the horrors and polarities of the year more than Get Out. It was undoubtedly the movie of 2017: a genre-bending film that managed to feel both timely and overdue. But what makes it not just the film of 2017, but emblematic of it, is best captured in audiences\u2019 divergent reactions to it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Seth Meyers on his late-night show, Allison Williams, who plays the film\u2019s surprise villain, Rose Armitage, describes the reaction she received from white people who had trouble believing that her character, a woman who preyed upon black people, was actually evil:\n\nThey\u2019d say, \u201cShe was hypnotized, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s just evil!\u201d How hard is that to accept? She\u2019s bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she\u2019s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That\u2019s so crazy! And they\u2019re still like, \u201cBut maybe she\u2019s also a victim?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNO! No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence. To break the hypnosis that continues to bind and betray us all.", "keywords": ["white", "innocence", "women", "violence", "virtue", "shes", "black", "supremacy", "armitage", "2017", "rose"], "polarity": 0.06526736813871553, "subjectivity": 0.3853764921946739},

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E.

After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds.

Sexism is a national problem and deserves a commensurate response from our leaders. Our current systems\u2014including those in colleges and universities\u2014protect powerful men and permit rape culture to continue.\n\n\n\nThe Weinstein case highlights how poorly Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 policies on sex discrimination and assault meet the needs of women.\n\nIn late September, DeVos rescinded an Obama directive, also known as the \u201cDear Colleague Letter\u201d (pdf), on how campuses should handle sexual assaults under Title IX, the federal policy on sexual discrimination. The letter reminded campus officials that they were responsible for preventing sexual harassment and violence, and provided examples of remedies and enforcement strategies. DeVos repealed the Obama policy largely based on a defense of people wrongfully accused of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cThere are men and women, boys and girls, who are survivors,\u201d DeVos said in her speech on Title IX in September. \u201cAnd there are men and women, boys and girls who are wrongfully accused.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncredibly, DeVos used an \u201cAll victims matter\u201d rationale to rescind the Obama directive. The speciousness of this argument is made apparent by the fact that not once did she utter the word \u201csexism\u201d in her prepared remarks.\n\nThe Weinstein case\u2014and the subsequent waves of disclosures about men in power that continue to break\u2014should force DeVos to confront what she obviously ignored in her argument for repeal: Powerful institutions (especially those led by men) ignore women\u2019s accounts of being harassed, abused and assaulted.\n\nWorse, they are so hostile toward women and so protective of influential men that victims are scared to speak out. Witness all the accounts of women who stayed silent about the assaults and harassment for decades, or those who spoke up and say they experienced retaliation\u2014all while Weinstein sat untouched atop a Miramax empire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t evident to DeVos earlier, it should be clear now: She needs a do-over. As more and more women come forward, DeVos should hear the cries of sexual assault victims and actually make Title IX more about addressing systems and less about finding some weird moral equivalency between victims and accusers.\n\nTwo months before DeVos rescinded the guidance, Candice E. Jackson, DeVos\u2019 acting assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education, told the New York Times that 90 percent of sexual assault complaints \u201cfall into the category of \u2018We were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018We broke up, and six months later, I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter widespread outrage at the suggestion that women were equally culpable in most sexual assault cases on campus, Jackson apologized. She has since walked back her statement a bit, stating before a Senate panel last week, \u201cIt\u2019s unproductive to speak in terms of false accusations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Dear Colleague Letter issued by the department that DeVos now leads, there were \u201c4,000 reported incidents of sexual battery and over 800 reported rapes and attempted rapes occurring in our nation\u2019s public high schools.\u201d More than 1 in 10 will have been sexually assaulted in or out of school before high school graduation, and \u201c20 percent of women will be victims of attempted or actual sexual assault, as will about 6 percent of undergraduate men.\u201d\n\nWe should treat Weinstein as an individual monster\u2014and as a product of our educational system. The former we cannot change, but how our schools and colleges treat victims and the accused, that we can.\n\nPresident Barack Obama sought to prioritize the rights of the victims by telling colleges to allow accusers to appeal not guilty findings, to discourage cross-examination of accusers and to accelerate verdicts. Obama urged colleges to consistently use the \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d or what is more likely than not, standard in sexual assault cases. The preponderance of evidence is considered the lowest degree of evidence necessary to establish proof, which empowers women to name rapists. The higher the standard for proving an assault, the less likely it is that women will come forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should treat Weinstein as an individual monster\u2014and as a product of our educational system. The former we cannot change, but how our schools and colleges treat victims and the accused, that we can.\n\nMany colleges resisted, arguing that the preponderance-of-evidence standard was too low a bar and would invite false accusations. In addition, several of the accused complained that the Obama guidance robbed defendants of due process, violated their individual rights and disregarded the autonomy of colleges to adjudicate these cases. Colleges also complained that the appeal process under the Obama guidance actually stretched out cases.\n\n\n\nAcquiescing, DeVos replaced Obama-era Title IX polices with an interim guidance (pdf), which gives colleges the freedom to decide what standard of evidence to use. Instead of giving women more choices to name their assailants, DeVos empowered institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the tussle between the powerful and the powerless, DeVos has sided with \u201cthe Man.\u201d DeVos\u2019 interim guidance misses the point that powerful men, even within the noblest of institutions, abuse their power to the detriment of women.\n\nWe tend to look at colleges as being progressive or conservative. But we also need to look at them as male-dominated and protecting the interests of men. Even though women make up more than 56 percent of collegians, men constitute 70 percent of college presidents.\n\nCampuses should give victims the benefit of the doubt in cases involving sexual assault. In addition, colleges are the first and last line of defense against a criminal-justice system in which \u201conly a quarter of all reported rapes lead to an arrest, only a fifth lead to prosecution, and only half of those prosecutions result in felony convictions,\u201d according to Know Your IX, a survivor- and youth-led organization focused on ending sexual and dating violence. On and off-campus, due process seems to favor men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe tend to look at colleges as being progressive or conservative. But we also need to look at them as male-dominated, and protecting the interests of men.\n\nTake convicted rapist Brock Turner as an example. Turner, then a member of the Stanford University swim team, raped an unconscious woman in 2015. Turner was found guilty, and prosecutors sought six years. Turner, a white man, received a mere six-month sentence, a slap on the wrist for what Turner\u2019s father dismissed at the sentencing as \u201c20 minutes of action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat he did to me doesn\u2019t expire, doesn\u2019t just go away after a set number of years,\u201d wrote the unnamed victim in a letter submitted to the court. \u201cIt stays with me, it\u2019s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the judge who sentenced Turner\u2014Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky\u2014said, \u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.\u201d\n\nNo wonder women often seek and expect justice through the honorable confines of the university.\n\nColleges also have a difficult time adjudicating sexual assault cases. Colleges have different judicial systems and no uniform standard of evidence. The absence of a consistent standard results in the passage of too much time and different levels of justice, which is why federal guidance is needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also the legitimate question of whether colleges have the capacity to adjudicate sexual assault cases. But DeVos\u2019 unwillingness to name institutional sexism and gender bias renders her commentary on this front meaningless.\n\nIn the wake of Weinstein, what is more likely than not is the tradition of powerful academic institutions protecting male interests. The reason powerful men get away with rape and harassment is that systems protect them.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing. Sing until you can\u2019t sing no more.\n\nWe need to flush the toilet on this administration and power-wash the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way to do that is to get everyone out first.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["pleaded", "lying", "pence", "trump", "pleading", "statement", "releases", "times", "james", "subtweet", "flynn", "sing", "russian", "responds", "guilty", "michael", "charges"], "polarity": 0.015477855477855481, "subjectivity": 0.45993839493839483},

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

But fuck! The evidence was right there, and I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Which makes me wonder if I just naturally give white people the benefit of the doubt. Or women. Or, gasp, white women.\n\nGet Out, of course, was as essential to 2017\u2019s collective zeitgeist as any other piece of art. The film was record-breaking, the characters\u2014pitch-perfect archetypes of subtly problematic liberal whiteness\u2014iconic, and the sunken place is now a permanent fixture of America\u2019s cultural lexicon. Before Get Out, Candyman and cockroaches were the only things that scared me. Now it\u2019s middle-aged white women with teacups.\n\nAnd the ending, well. I remember the dread I felt when I saw those police lights approach Chris. There\u2019d be no possible way for him to explain the dead white girl lying next to him and the dead parents a few hundred feet up the road. This is where, even though I was watching it in a theater, the realities of our reality became too stark and too heavy to ignore. And an alternative ending to the movie, which I watched for the very first time last week, depicted that worst-case but terrifyingly plausible scenario.\n\nKeeping that ending probably would\u2019ve made Get Out an even better movie. It would have completed the Kafkaesque journey it took us on, proving that Chris\u2019 efforts were ultimately futile. The moment he agreed to visit Rose\u2019s family, imprisonment was the only outcome. His sense of choice had been relinquished, his fate determined. But as much as I appreciate movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d (well, movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d except for Funny Games, because fuck that movie), I think I needed Get Out to end the way it did. I think I wouldn\u2019t have been able to watch it again if it ended with Chris behind bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think I think these things because of when Get Out was released. I saw it a month after Donald Trump was inaugurated. And I think I hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the shock of what had happened in our country in the months before that. (For the record, I still don\u2019t think I have. I\u2019ve had more random aches and aliments in the last 12 months than I had in the last 12 years combined. I doubt that\u2019s a coincidence.)\n\nThe ending, at least, allowed for a brief exhalation, a minuscule but meaningful respite from the world we\u2019d return to when the credits rolled. America had just reminded us that we\u2019re all Chris. That we\u2019re all stuck on the Armitage compound, all surrounded by people who call themselves allies and spin themselves as friends, all aware that something is off but not quite able to articulate exactly what it is. And I think I needed that catharsis.

So to find that the fingerprints of coal lobbyist-turned-ENRD acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Wood are on an environmental-racism scandal is, actually, pretty par for the course with the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency found elevated levels (pdf) of arsenic, lead and carcinogenic hydrocarbons\u2014courtesy of a nearby coking plant\u2014near 35th Avenue in the black neighborhood of North Birmingham, Ala. The EPA established the neighborhood as a Superfund site, a class of highly polluted areas where contributions from culpable polluters and the government pay for cleanup. In 2013 the EPA and the original offender, Walter Coke, argued that four other companies were also likely responsible for the pollution, including two clients of nearby law firm Balch & Bingham: Drummond and ABC Coke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the next two years, the agency pushed to add the site to its National Priorities List, or NPL\u2014which would have granted more authority to require those implicated to fund cleanup initiatives. It also proposed extending testing to Tarrant, a neighborhood a mile northeast of 35th Avenue. Pushback from business interests and politicians was swift and fierce: In 2014, then-Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange argued that the state wouldn\u2019t provide any funding for the cleanup, and in 2015, Drummond and Balch & Bingham sued the EPA (pdf).\n\nThen an unlikely ally emerged for Balch & Bingham\u2019s clients: Oliver Robinson. The charismatic basketball player-cum-58th District congressman had long been involved in the local community through his galas celebrating black achievement and his charity, the Robinson Foundation. Now he was striking a markedly different tone.\n\nSpearheading a horseshit-sandwich campaign contradicted by EPA evidence, Robinson argued that the soil testing would lower property values. His daughter helped stoke distrust in the feds, sending out dissuading emails and erecting signs urging folks to \u201cGet Smart Tarrant\u2014Don\u2019t Let EPA Fool You!\u201d Ultimately, the NPL proposal died. The implicated companies have yet to contribute to the cleanup, and Robinson resigned last year\u2014but not before taking bribes and implicating Wood, the acting assistant attorney general entrusted with protecting the environment, in a scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter an investigation by two agencies, Robinson entered a plea agreement June 22 on charges of conspiracy, bribery and fraud for using his nonprofit to funnel a $134,000 payment from Balch & Bingham and $30,000 from Alabama Power\u2014a subsidiary of Southern Co., one of the largest and most politically powerful coal-dependent utility groups, and Balch & Bingham\u2019s biggest client.\n\nDuring that time, Balch & Bingham\u2019s point lobbyist for Southern Co. and Alabama Power was a brilliant partner by the name of Jeffrey Wood. Before that, in 2014, Wood was also counsel for Alabama Sen. and Keebler elf-turned-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nNow, as acting assistant attorney general of the ENRD, Wood has the job of enforcing laws related to the environment, natural resources, health and pollution\u2014prosecuting environmental crimes and defending against lawsuits challenging environmental protection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Wood was lobbying a week before assuming the ENRD job on Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration day might sound as if it violates Monsieur Great Again\u2019s marquee, swamp-draining ban on former lobbyists taking positions that give them oversight over their old lobbying interests. In practice, Wood was simply recused from presiding over issues (pdf) related to several dozen firms, companies and cases\u2014including, specifically, the North Birmingham Superfund site.\n\nIn fact, Wood\u2014Balch & Bingham\u2019s go-to Southern lobbyist\u2014was specifically recused from touching the Superfund site, and during his tenure at the law firm, he was one of its few lobbyists with Superfund policy expertise. Shortly after the Robinsons\u2019 campaign, he even shifted to lobbying on Superfund policies on Capitol Hill.\n\nTo be legally safe here, none of this is to say that Wood had direct involvement in Robinson\u2019s misinformation campaign or bribery. Robinson acknowledged taking bribes from a partner, but that partner remains unnamed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root reached out to Wood and several of his associates from his tenure with Sessions and Balch & Bingham, but the only response, after we were redirected to the law firm\u2019s public relations person, was, \u201cEach of our lobbyists file registrations describing their lobbying activities,\u201d a reference back to the very lobbying disclosure forms we hyperlinked in an email to them.\n\n\n\nLuckily, we might soon find out more about the extent of Wood\u2019s involvement. After Balch & Bingham was dragged before a federal grand jury in March, and Robinson specifically mentioned working with one of their partners, there\u2019s sure to be a follow-up.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Trump-Russia investigation\u2019s special counsel is looking into Balch & Bingham and Wood, thanks to K.B. Forbes, leader of the advocacy group Consejo de Latinos Unidos, or CDLU. He publicized the law firm\u2019s ties to Black Hall, a Russian-linked aerospace company (which was originally going to host the rally where Sessions endorsed Trump). Afterward, Balch & Bingham\u2019s website and the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the lobbyist who successfully changed Russia sanctions on Mi-17 helicopters\u2014Black Hall\u2019s bread and butter\u2014were scrubbed of all mention of the company.\n\nIn response, Forbes submitted his research to special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee, who are currently reviewing Balch & BIngham\u2019s affairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, we\u2019re left with just results of a smell test: Something smells like arsenic, aromatic hydrocarbons and bullshit, and it could be that the man charged with prosecuting on behalf of the environment is complicit in a scandal of economic and environmental racism, and boasts sprawling conflicts of interest that could ensure many of his energy- and utilities-related decisions turn a profit for old employers.", "keywords": ["assistant", "wood", "jeffrey", "eau", "cologne", "attorney", "bingham", "lobbying", "robinson", "epa", "balch", "binghams", "bull", "environmental", "superfund", "general", "racism"], "polarity": 0.13269841269841268, "subjectivity": 0.44953093203093203},

The rules would have required the program to inform graduates of their poor outcomes, and would eventually have prohibited students from taking out loans to attend.\ufeff\n\n\n\nDeVos halted enforcement of the gainful employment rule, effectively allowing schools to avoid disclosing this information. The Department of Education is currently working on rewriting the rule entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe suit, filed Tuesday by 17 states and the District of Columbia, alleges that DeVos is breaking the law by refusing to enforce the gainful employment rule, which has been upheld multiple times by federal courts after for-profit institutions challenged the regulation.\n\nThe lawsuit is being led by Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. The AG told the Washington Post yesterday that it was \u201coutrageous for the DOE to say they\u2019re going to allow these predatory institutions to continue to take advantage of people who are vulnerable, people with very few resources.\u201d\n\nMany education advocates suspected DeVos would champion the interests of for-profit colleges, and they\u2019ve yet to be proven wrong. In September, DeVos had the gall to appoint one of DeVry University\u2019s former deans to run an anti-fraud unit in the Department of Education. In 2016, DeVry agreed to a $100 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission because of years of cooking their graduates\u2019 employment stats (As Slate reported, DeVry counted grads serving food at the Cheesecake Factory as working \u201cin their field\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much like asking Harvey Weinstein to run a sexual harassment task force.\n\nUnless the courts intervene, DeVos will continue to leave graduates vulnerable to fraud. The same attorneys general who filed Tuesday\u2019s suit are also suing DeVos over her refusal to enforce the borrower defense rule\u2014another Obama-era regulation.\n\nThat rule sets up a process that allows students who claim they were defrauded by for-profit institutions to apply for loan forgiveness. According to BuzzFeed, not only did DeVos tell a group of Republican leaders that the rule offered \u201cfree money\u201d to any student that \u201craised his or her hands\u201d\u2014the DOE has yet to approve a single claim by a defrauded student.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the Cheeto-dusted dotard that put her in charge, DeVos\u2019 has attacked Obama-era protections with the single-mindedness of a wrecking ball. If she succeeds in undoing the regulations, it will have a disproportionate impact on black graduates.\n\nBlack grads incur much higher student loan debt than their non-black peers, and data shows that predatory for-profit institutions are largely to blame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA study reported by the Atlantic found that black graduates have nearly double the loan debt of white grads four years after graduation\u2014despite having similar amounts of debt at the moment they receive their diplomas.\n\nWhile factors like employment discrimination and defaults are partially to blame, researchers found that graduate school discrepancies contributed the most to that yawning debt gap.

And she was every bit the bombshell birthday girl, looking snatched for the gawds in a glimmering golden gown.\n\nThat morning, she kicked off her personal new year by unveiling her brand-spanking-new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an honor well-deserved by the woman whose accolades include nine Grammy Awards (and 31 nominations) and 10 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nOf course, Blige is no stranger to high style or red carpets\u2014though we\u2019d be lying if we said that her recent glow up doesn\u2019t feel extra special. But what we\u2019re really loving about Blige\u2019s #BestWeekEver is that it reminds us about the beauty awaiting us in every breakdown\u2014in her case, the ongoing dissolution of her marriage. It\u2019s always a wonderful thing to see your heroes win; but for a star who\u2019s remained as relatable as Blige, it\u2019s also inspiring to see her continue to channel her worst moments into her best performances, as she shared with Variety magazine:\n\n\n\nI used a lot of my own heaviness from my own misery that I was living in that horrible marriage ... I was just dying in it. I knew something was wrong. I just couldn\u2019t prove it. I just had all the heaviness of not feeling right, not feeling good. I gave it to [the character of] Florence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the experience of stripping down to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife during the Great Depression also proved to be affirming for the megastar, helping her tap into the true beauty of being just Mary, without the trappings of being megastar Mary J. Blige.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t wear makeup. We couldn\u2019t have nails. We couldn\u2019t do eyelashes. I was stripped down to the bare necessities of Mary. And that really helped me because people were saying things like, \u2018Gosh \u2014 you\u2019re so beautiful.\u2019 It helped my self-esteem.\n\nAnd it shows. Frankly, we\u2019ve never seen Blige more beautiful than she has been lately. This Glow Up Goddess is showing us that the lotus truly does grow in the mud\u2014or, in her case, in her gorgeous performance in Mudbound. She may not be entirely free of the mess with her soon-to-be-ex, but we\u2019re thrilled to see she\u2019s well on her way to being happy.", "keywords": ["blige", "living", "looks", "shes", "love", "mary", "nominations", "megastar", "marriage", "couldnt", "star", "fine", "looking", "best", "life", "j", "really"], "polarity": 0.29032774170274156, "subjectivity": 0.5998616522366522},

They sent a letter to Kushner via his attorney Abbe Lowell and requested that he double-check that he had turned over all relevant documents to the committee\u2014including anything from his \u201cpersonal email account described to the news media, as well as all other email accounts, messaging apps or similar communications channels you may have used, or that may contain information relevant to our inquiry.\u201d\n\nKushner used the personal email account from January through August of this year. CNN reports that Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman and vice chairman of the committee, respectively, learned of the existence of the email account through the media. Their letter specifically references a CNN report from Sunday, in which Kushner\u2019s lawyer confirmed that his client had used his personal email account for correspondence with administration officials.\n\n\u201cMr. Kushner uses his White House email address to conduct White House business,\u201d Lowell said in a statement. \u201cFewer than a hundred emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr. Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best part of this story, however, is the manner in which CNN came to be in possession of all this tea information.\n\nThere is a man from the United Kingdom who calls himself the \u201cEmail Prankster.\u201d He is known for having tricked several high-profile people in the Trump administration into having very candid conversations with him via email by impersonating other people. His list of victims includes Eric Trump, Russian Ambassador-designee Jon Huntsman Jr., former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci (twice!), cybersecurity expert and Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert and, most recently, Kushner\u2019s attorney, Lowell.\n\nOn Monday, the prankster posed as Kushner and emailed Lowell asking if he should delete some emails that contained \u201cadult content\u201d from his private email account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLowell, obviously thinking that the emails were from the real Kushner, advised his \u201cclient\u201d not to delete the adult content and not to send it to anyone.\n\nFast-forward to Thursday, and Lowell is receiving the email from the Senate Intelligence Committee. In his attempt to then forward that email to his client, he accidentally forwarded it to the email address the prankster used earlier in the week and the prankster, in turn, forwarded it to CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I were making this up.\n\nHow do you have so many people working with or in close proximity to the highest office in the country getting duped by an email prankster?

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

While that drama is unfortunately still playing out, it\u2019s exciting to see one of our favorite songbirds getting the respect and recognition she\u2019s due from the entertainment industry. We hope it\u2019s one of many wins to come as she steps into awards season.\n\nSays Ana Martinez, producer of the Walk of Fame ceremonies: \u201cMary J. Blige is one of the most popular singers of our generation. Fans will be thrilled to see her star on the boulevard as her career milestones are celebrated on this very famous sidewalk.\u201d\n\nMary\u2019s is a voice we truly can\u2019t be without.

Early Monday, Kushner released an 11-page statement claiming that he had no contact with Russian-government representatives beyond those that have already been publicly disclosed.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reports:\n\nKushner offers his first public accounting of what he says are his four meetings with Russians during the 2016 campaign and transition, offering previously undisclosed details of those meetings. The statement comes as federal and congressional investigators are scrutinizing Kushner\u2019s contacts with Russians as part of their probes into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s troubling about the Trump administration\u2019s transparency ruse. After information has been discovered, or members of the administration are set to testify, there is what appears to be a public concession of truth. The Trumpians or Trumpites publicly release a statement of previously undisclosed documentation as if to say, \u201cSee, I\u2019ve got nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nWhen the New York Times was set to disclose that the president\u2019s oldest child, Donald Trump Jr., had met with a Russian lawyer under the pretense that he was going to receive damaging information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Don Jr. took to Twitter to release emails detailing the meeting. It was supposed to be done under the guise of truth, except all of it happened to scoop the New York Times and give the appearance of transparency.\n\nSame is happening with Kushner\u2019s 11-page letter. But don\u2019t be fooled, because here is what we know about Kushner: Either he\u2019s one of the most incompetent people in this administration, which is saying a lot, or, like his father-in-law, he\u2019s a liar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, Kushner blamed an assistant for leaving a portion of his security-clearance form, the portion that just so happens to include meetings and/or dealings with foreign contacts, blank. According to Kushner, the draft of his form was submitted in error and a supplemental form was sent the day after the error was realized.\n\nRecently, Kushner submitted a revised financial disclosure form after he \u201cinadvertently omitted\u201d some $10 million in assets from his original disclosure. We should all be so lucky to forget about $10 million in assets.\n\nNevertheless, Kushner is set to testify Monday, and don\u2019t expect any groundbreaking news to come from this closed-door meeting. Expect Kushner to claim that there was no collusion between him and the Russians. You can also believe that Kushner will claim as just an oversight the reason his financial and security clearance forms weren\u2019t correct. Kushner is cut from the same cloth as his father-in-law, so expect him to feign ignorance and push the company\u2019s \u201cno collusion\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a developing story.

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

I\u2019m dark-skinned, bro,\u201d said Kaluuya in an interview with GQ. \u201cWhen I\u2019m around black people, I\u2019m made to feel \u2018other\u2019 because I\u2019m dark-skinned. I\u2019ve had to wrestle with that, with people going, \u2018You\u2019re too black.\u2019 Then I come to America and they say, \u2018You\u2019re not black enough.\u2019 I go to Uganda, I can\u2019t speak the language. In India, I\u2019m black. In the black community, I\u2019m dark-skinned. In America, I\u2019m British. Bro!\u201d\n\nKaluuya also explained that black people in the United Kingdom also deal with racism and it\u2019s a universal issue, and there are few stories out there that tell of their own experiences.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting singled out for the color of your skin, but not the content of your spirit, and that\u2019s everywhere,\u201d the actor continued. \u201cThat\u2019s my whole life, being seen as \u2018other.\u2019 Not fitting in in Uganda, not Britain, not America. They just highlight whatever feature they want.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really respect African-American people. I just want to tell black stories,\u201d Kaluuya said. \u201cThis is the frustrating thing, bro\u2014in order to prove that I can play this role, I have to open up about the trauma that I\u2019ve experienced as a black person. I have to show off my struggle so that people accept that I\u2019m black.\n\n\u201cNo matter that every single room I go to I\u2019m usually the darkest person there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying? I kind of resent that mentality. I\u2019m just an individual. Just because you\u2019re black, you taken and used to represent something. It mirrors what happens in the film. I resent that I have to prove that I\u2019m black. I don\u2019t know what that is. I\u2019m still processing it.\u201d\n\nJackson later clarified his comments and said that he wasn\u2019t blaming Kaluuya, but the Hollywood system that seemingly shuts out African-American actors in favor of their British counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was not a slam against them, but it was just a comment about how Hollywood works in an interesting sort of way sometimes,\u201d Jackson told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not afforded that same luxury, but that\u2019s fine; we have plenty of opportunities to work,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI enjoy their work,\u201d Jackson said of the British actors. \u201cI enjoy working with them when I have the opportunity to do that.\u201d", "keywords": ["samuel", "outs", "daniel", "darkskinned", "jackson", "africanamerican", "youre", "black", "america", "resent", "prove", "im", "l", "jacksons", "comments", "thats", "kaluuya", "british"], "polarity": 0.030371660859465736, "subjectivity": 0.3781939605110337},

DeVos said that the Obama administration helped elevate the issue of sexual assault and issued guidance with good intentions, but good intentions alone are not enough.\n\n(What?)\n\nAccording to The Hill, DeVos said that the Obama policies have failed too many survivors and that \u201cvictims\u201d of false accusations lack due process on campuses. She said that a school that fails to take a report of sexual assault seriously commits discrimination.\n\nShe also said that a school with a system biased toward finding someone guilty of sexual assault is also guilty of discrimination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Let that sink in, because that\u2019s deep.)\n\n\u201cThe rights of one person can never be paramount to the rights of another,\u201d DeVos said.\n\nAs part of the process for making these changes, DeVos said that the Department of Education will issue a public notice and have a comment period so that the public can provide input on better ways to enforce Title IX sex discrimination laws and create an effective system that protects the rights of all students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, to be fair, until we actually see the changes she wants to make, we don\u2019t know what policies DeVos is planning to put into place.

I believe this because people who make false accusations make it harder for real victims to be believed.

Creating new systems for dealing with false accusations is a good remedy, and that should be the route this process takes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a system that makes victims hesitant to report the crimes against them is, in and of itself, a crime.

They\u2019re so out of the box, in fact, that they\u2019ve completed a full revolution around the sun and they\u2019re back in the same fucking box. A box that someone needs to staple shut and drop-kick into a puddle.\n\nA few hundred words into the piece, they attempt to explain their rationale with an example of how it would work\u2014a hypothetical featuring recently laid-off West Virginians with dog-walking side hustles so thriving they need to hit up Craigslist ... but for undocumented immigrants for help. If there were a Pulitzer for \u201cWriting While Aggressively White,\u201d this passage would definitely be a nominee:\n\nImagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to.

The film was adapted from the 2008 Hillary Jordan novel about two families\u2014one black and one white\u2014attempting to stay afloat by sharecropping the same patch of hard Mississippi acreage in the World War II era.\n\nI won\u2019t drop any spoilers here, but Mudbound is a captivating watch\u2014the film was nominated for two Golden Globes (though it ultimately lost), and Mary J. Blige is a revelation as a matriarch. It excels in large part because of its dedication to authenticity, including how whites treated black folks (and how blacks had to treat whites in order to survive) in the Jim Crow South. The rage-whitening of your black knuckles only intensifies as the movie creeps toward its climax, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re left with the residue of anger at our treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain period films allow us to escape to days long past with a relative certainty that the technology, mindsets and quality of life portrayed have permanently evolved, but black Americans\u2014most of whom, at the very least, have living parents or grandparents who faced legal consequences for using the same toilet as white people\u2014aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of viewing such things passively. Mudbound is set some seven decades ago, but in a #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, tiki-torch, George Zimmerman-still-walks-as-a-free-man America that reminds you just how little shit has changed since then, it\u2019s not so easy to divorce oneself from the fact that it\u2019s just a movie.\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s a metric-ass ton of films that evoke these feelings within us. Damon Young created a list a few years back, but he only scratched the surface of what could easily be a 5,000-word article. So here\u2019s a very nonexhaustive list of films that make me kinda wanna trip Kaitlyn as she strolls out of Lululemon:\n\nDetroit (2017)\n\nAudiences pretty much steered clear of this film, which is based on the 1967 Detroit rebellion, likely because they heard that the middle hour is like a Saw film for racially motivated police brutality. Detroit is actually a decent film, and I was one of the few black reviewers who gave it praise. But after watching a press screening, I skipped out on the star-studded world premiere for the same reason I\u2019ll likely never watch the film again: because ain\u2019t nobody got time to be miserable for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder in Mississippi (1990)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie starring Blair Underwood traumatized me when I was a young child with an inchoate understanding of racism. Based on the real-life murder of civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, the film\u2019s protagonists inspired 8-year-old me before I had to watch them get dragged out of their vehicles and executed in the conclusion. They might as well have clipped Mr. Rogers in front of me. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on this film for the better part of 30 years, but it\u2019s the only reason I refused to stop for gas when driving through Mississippi at night while in my 20s.\n\n\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nIt\u2019s not always the films that feature explicit white-on-black violence. Dead Presidents masterfully depicts the black American condition as it\u2019s affected by the sublimation of overt racism: Young black and brown men fight the white man\u2019s war (Vietnam here, but isn\u2019t every war the white man\u2019s war?), only to return home with addictions, illness, injuries, emotional trauma and scarce financial options. Not even the liberal use of Terrence Howard\u2019s \u201cmayne,\u201d Clifton Powell\u2019s \u201cnyuguh\u201d or the best soundtrack ever make the conclusion less depressing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican History X (1998)\n\nThough it\u2019s in my top 10 all-time favorite films, this white nationalist redemption tale is never too easy to take in. Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard is a nasty Nazi bastard before eventually becoming a sympathetic character, and Stacy Keach\u2019s predatory patriarch motivating children to hate is infuriating. And of course, there\u2019s that curbside scene\u2014hit the \u201cplay\u201d button on the above video if you, too, wish to be pissed off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitch Perfect movies\n\nIncluded in this list because I can\u2019t think of a series that better personifies the unbridled caucasity that is the Hollywood machine than one that portrays the \u201ccompetitive\u201d world of collegiate a cappella as comedy. The industry is doing a better-than-ever job of green-lighting the stories of marginalized voices, and Moonlight getting the Oscars drop on Fluffernutter-sandwich-turned-cinematic-experience La La Land was monumental. But it\u2019s still tough to see Pitch Perfect films being made even when no one asked for them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nPretty much every white person in Jordan Peele\u2019s blockbuster is written to appall. But there\u2019s a unique animus that should be reserved for Allison Williams\u2019 Rose Armitage, the (spoiler alert) main cog in the machine of a family that subverts and \u201ctransforms\u201d black folks into modern-day slaves. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 \u2026 she should\u2019ve gotten it much worse in the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nMuch has been written about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s liberal use of the n-word in his films, but few will argue that the man can\u2019t write a good revenge tale. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s unctuous plantation owner is impressively reprehensible as a man who forces his slaves to participate in some ungodly mixed martial arts for his amusement. But it\u2019s the scene in which dogs tear a slave to pieces that makes us root for Jamie Foxx\u2019s Django to snatch the life of every human of European descent on-screen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurviving the Game (1994)\n\nAn entire movie centered on rich white men (and Charles S. \u201cRoc\u201d Dutton) hunting a homeless black man for sport. Get past the action-thriller aspect of the film (which isn\u2019t too shabby for the early 1990s) and focus on the optics of Ice-T\u2019s down-on-his-luck widower thinking he\u2019s catching a break at the hands of some well-meaning white folks who are all betting on being the first to off him. It\u2019s fitting that Rutger Hauer, the poster boy for Hollywood bad guys whom you\u2019d probably steer clear of in real life, plays the main antagonist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewood (1997)\n\nYeah, I know Damon has this on his list. But John Singleton\u2019s best film not named Boyz n the Hood remains the gold standard of don\u2019t-bring-your-Anglo-ass-anywhere-within-10-yards-of-me-after-I-watch-this filmmaking. Based on a real-life 1920s massacre following the lie of a white woman on a black man, not many films before or since Rosewood have so unflinchingly depicted raw white brutality on black bodies.

Jackson has some thoughts about black British actors securing American roles instead of African Americans, suggesting that perhaps black Americans could add some authenticity, especially when dealing with culturally specific things like America\u2019s struggles with interracial relationships.\n\n\n\nDuring an interview Monday with Hot 97 while promoting his newest film, Kong: Skull Island, Jackson cited films such as the most recent crowd fave, Get Out, which features British actor Daniel Kaluuya as a black American going to visit his white girlfriend, only to find some insidious racist, scary crap going down (still trying not to give any spoilers, although I suspect everyone has seen it by now).\n\nAt any rate, Jackson seemingly questioned how much more authentic the film would have been if a black American had been able to play Kaluuya\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cI know the young brother who\u2019s in the movie, and he\u2019s British,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere are a lot of black British actors that work in this country. All the time. I tend to wonder what would that movie have been with an American brother who really understands that in a way. Because Daniel grew up in a country where they\u2019ve been interracial dating for a hundred years. Britain, there\u2019s only about eight real white people left in Britain \u2026 what would a brother from America have made of that role? I\u2019m sure the director helped. Some things are universal, but everything ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen probed further about the phenomenon of black British actors playing African Americans, Jackson mused: \u201cThey don\u2019t cost as much. Unless you\u2019re an unknown brother that they\u2019re finding somewhere. They think they\u2019re better-trained, for some reason, than we are because they\u2019re classically trained. I don\u2019t know what the love affair is with all that. It\u2019s all good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson went on to add: \u201cEverybody needs to work, but there are a lot of brothers here that need to work, too. They come here because there are more opportunities, and they actually get paid when they work here. Which is fine.\u201d\n\nBritish actor John Boyega, who famously played Finn in Star Wars: Episode VII\u2014The Force Awakens, jumped in on Twitter, tweeting that \u201cblack brits vs African American\u201d was a \u201cstupid ass conflict\u201d that nobody has time for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson later came back to defend his commentary, but insisted that \u201cit was not a slam against [black British actors].\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just a comment about how Hollywood works in an interesting sort of way sometimes,\u201d he clarified to the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re not afforded that same luxury, but that\u2019s fine; we have plenty of opportunities to work \u2026 I enjoy their work ... I enjoy working with them when I have the opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think?

The racism and xenophobia that we saw on the University of Virginia campus was born out of America\u2019s historical endorsement of slavery, segregation, discrimination and biased policies. Hundreds marched with tiki torches, chanting \u201cWhite lives matter\u201d on Friday, and a riot ensued the next day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House\u2019s reluctance to condemn white supremacy and racism shows just how far we\u2019ve progressed (which is to say, not much). Those who used the #ThisIsNotUs hashtag in the aftermath of the neo-Nazi, \u201calt-right,\u201d Ku Klux Klan march could not be more wrong.\n\nI assume that those who posted it on social media were trying to diminish the hundreds of people who descended on the town as an aberration, and showing solidarity in a careful way with those whom racism harms. All of which is more evidence that schools are clearly failing our students and society at large.\n\nJelani Cobb, the New Yorker columnist, tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos\u2019 remarks have been much less insightful. She wrote a two-tweet response to the violence that read:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer generic and woefully insufficient statement effectively sanitized the hate that neo-Nazis, Klan members and alt-right demonstrators put on full display as they shouted Nazi slogans such as \u201cSieg heil\u201d and waved Confederate flags while carrying military gear. DeVos, the nation\u2019s top teacher (clearly symbolic), failed the basic test of providing leadership to teachers, education officials and counselors on how to educate students out of bigotry, white supremacy and violence.\n\n\n\nIn an Associated Press story, DeVos said that Washington, D.C. (aka the federal government), has a responsibility to \u201cset a tone.\u201d But what tone did she set? Instead of unequivocally condemning the hateful and divisive ideology that was espoused by the neo-Nazi marchers, DeVos issued two bland tweets in the passive tense that proclaimed her disgust with the behavior and rhetoric that was displayed (by whom? against whom?) and even managed to include a qualification that all Americans should be able to speak their minds.\n\nEffective educators name, describe and identify\u2014no matter how painful it is to look hatred in the face\u2014the conditions that students, teachers and families must face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos is not ready to lead, and her response proves it anew. From the opening bell of her confirmation hearings to her nonstatement on Charlottesville, DeVos continues to show that she cannot be the education secretary our country deserves and so desperately needs.\n\nIn this way, she mirrors her boss, whose initial statements were criticized by many for being vague and weak, but the public\u2019s outcry backed Trump into revising his statement and delivering a speech on Monday (although it probably should have been given before this planned hate march took place). DeVos, however, has yet to offer a more robust denouncement or any further guidance for teachers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who are targeted by hate groups are stepping forward, since DeVos and Trump have failed to step up. Melinda Anderson, who writes for the Atlantic and is a member of the collaborative EduColor, started the hashtag #CharlottesvilleCurriculum, through which teachers and education support groups are providing resources to help teachers at this critical time.\n\n\n\nOne of the best sources of information posting to the hashtag is the nonprofit Teaching Tolerance, which provides free resources to teachers, administrators, counselors and other practitioners. The organization has been helping teachers educate for a diverse democracy for years.\n\nI have to assume that Trump\u2019s and DeVos\u2019 slowness in naming racism reflects either that they don\u2019t know that white supremacy is supported by \u201cfake news\u201d and bigoted, politically driven and unscientific ideologies\u2014or that they believe in them. Neither is acceptable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and DeVos are failing our students. Charlottesville was their teachable moment, and they failed the test. How we teach in the aftermath of Charlottesville can be a bright footnote in the sordid history of American bigotry or it can be just more of the same.\n\nWe can\u2019t hide the past, but we can educate our way out of it. We just need the right teachers to do it.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "hate", "racism", "charlottesville", "teachable", "trump", "teachers", "recognize", "betsy", "domestic", "supremacy", "students", "moment", "terrorism", "va", "devos", "fails", "education"], "polarity": 0.014840404040404032, "subjectivity": 0.42245108225108224},

She\u2019s able to see me. We love each other. The love has grown. That stuff is minutiae. It\u2019s not that important.\u201d\n\nThe biggest surprise of the night came when Denzel Washington won his first SAG Award for best actor for his role in Fences. Many people, including Washington, thought the award was going to Casey Affleck, and his speech reflected that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know, I am a God-fearing man. I\u2019m supposed to have faith, but I didn\u2019t have faith. God bless you all, all the other actors.

Davis won in the best supporting actress in a motion picture category. Davis used her speech to thank Fences\u2019 playwright, August Wilson.\n\n\u201cWhat August did so beautifully is he honored the average man, who happened to be a man of color,\u201d she said at the podium. \u201cAnd sometimes we don\u2019t have to shake the world and move the world and create anything that is going to be in the history book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that we breathed and lived a life and was a god to our children, just that, means that we have a story and it deserves to be told,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe deserve to be in the canon of any\u2014in the center of any narrative that\u2019s written out there. And that\u2019s what August did. He elevated my father, my mother, my uncles who had eighth- and fifth-grade educations, and he just encapsulated them in history.\u201d\n\nThe final award of the night went to the cast of Hidden Figures, who also used the opportunity to speak about love prevailing, when they won for best movie ensemble.\n\n\n\nTaraji P. Henson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Octavia Spencer accepted the award, and Henson reminded people what happens when you come together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis story is about unity,\u201d Henson said. \u201cThis story is about what happens when we put our differences aside and we come together as a human race. We win. Love wins. Every time.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the awards show, the most poignant afterthoughts came from Davis when she spoke about inclusion and #OscarsSoWhite. According to Davis, she doesn\u2019t think that was the reason black people took home awards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of typecasting\u2014age, sex, color, dark-skinned, light-skinned,\u201d said Davis. \u201cResponse to OscarsSoWhite? No. I think that every nominee, from Naomie Harris to Octavia Spencer to Hidden Figures to Fences to Moonlight to Mahershala Ali, are up there because they deserve to be there.

Not-Ivanka claims that he didn\u2019t know the name of the person with whom he would be meeting before it took place, but CNN has confirmed that the Russian lawyer he met with was Natalia Veselnitskaya.\n\nBecause the then-TrumPutin campaign, now TrumPutin administration, had a not-love affair with Clinton, Not-Ivanka invited Got Dem Visas and disgraced Manafort along for the meeting. Not-Ivanka claims that the other two had no idea of the substance of the meeting but agreed to attend anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,\u201d Trump Jr. said in the statement, CNN reports. \u201cHer statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\u201d\n\nNot-Ivanka claims that the subject of the meeting quickly switched to the adoption of Russian children and a U.S. law known as the Magnitsky Act, \u201cwhich allows the U.S. to withhold visas and freeze the assets of Russians thought to have violated human rights,\u201d CNN reports.\n\nNot-Ivanka claims that the meeting became pointless for those in attendance who hate Hillary Clinton, since it appeared that Veselnitskaya had pulled a bait-and-switch on the group, bringing them in under the pretense of providing damaging information about their rival, only to push her true agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting. I interrupted and advised her that my father was not an elected official, but rather a private citizen, and that her comments and concerns were better addressed if and when he held public office,\u201d Not-Ivanka\u2019s statement read, according to CNN.\n\nNot-Ivanka claims that the meeting lasted only 20-30 minutes.\n\n\u201cAs it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it, and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events,\u201d Not-Ivanka said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Times, the meeting took place at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after TrumPutin had secured the Republican presidential nomination. The disclosure marks the first time TrumPutin\u2019s administration has acknowledged that a senior member of TrumPutin\u2019s Cabinet met with a Russian national during the campaign.\n\nVeselnitskaya\u2019s account of events from that day conflict with Not-Ivanka\u2019s claims. She told the New York Times, \u201cNothing at all was discussed about the presidential campaign.\u201d She added, \u201cI have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere is where all of this gets amusing: In March, Not-Ivanka told the Times that he\u2019d never met with any Russians while working in a campaign capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDid I meet with people that were Russian? I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m sure I did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut none that were set up. None that I can think of at the moment. And certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nIn fact, TrumPutin, Vice President Mike Pence and resident dunce (which is a hard title to get in this administration) Kellyanne Conway confirmed that there had been no contact between Russians and TrumPutin\u2019s campaign before the election, the Washington Post reports.\n\nAnd Not-Ivanka has blown all of that out of the water. Now the spin by this New York Knicks administration is to claim that the meeting was only about Russian adoptions and nothing else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s see how this all shakes out, but I won\u2019t be holding my breath. At this point, there are those of us who clearly know the Russians have burner phones and footage of the Pissy President, and there are the deplorables, who will argue that a Russian flag hanging over the White House is a symbol of friendship.", "keywords": ["jr", "confirmed", "information", "trumputin", "russians", "usas", "cousin", "times", "campaign", "meeting", "play", "trumputins", "notivanka", "russian", "claims", "fact", "trump", "russia"], "polarity": 0.0787083664634685, "subjectivity": 0.45893556556821863},

In Pittsburgh alone, there are at least 26 different grades of whiteness, including garden-variety Yinzer whiteness, Appalachian-adjacent whiteness, well-meaning Patagonia whiteness, Lululemon whiteness and Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nAnd sometimes, as in the story about Belen Aldecosea\u2014the Florida woman who, when allegedly told that she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her emotional-support hamster on a plane, allegedly flushed said hamster down the toilet\u2014the levels of whiteness converge to form a whiteness souffl\u00e9. A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster. Hamsters are cute and great and all, but there\u2019s nothing about a hamster that has ever made me think, \u201cI wish that hamster would give me a hug.\u201d This must have been a charismatic-ass hamster. The Mahershala Ali of hamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. The bulk of my adult life has been spent intentionally avoiding enclosed places where rodents might be. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6. The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The fact that she apparently already has a new hamster, one that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also murder when told she\u2019s not allowed to co-sign a loan for it.\n\n9. The fact that SOMEONE SOLD ANOTHER HAMSTER TO AN INFAMOUS HAMSTER MURDERER. Niggas go to prison for 50 years for stealing Snickers Ice Cream Bars, and this known hamster murderer gets help.\n\n10. The fact that her name is Belen Aldecosea, but what happened is so white that for now on I\u2019m just going to call her Kirstjen Nielsen.", "keywords": ["woman", "shes", "flushed", "hamster", "levels", "airport", "emotionalsupport", "whitest", "bring", "whiteness", "things", "toilet", "gotdamn", "plane", "told", "fact", "im"], "polarity": 0.0061110247776914465, "subjectivity": 0.533083916083916},

But where Sebastian Silva\u2019s Sundance flick differs from Jordan Peele\u2019s Oscar-nominated movie is that Tyrel exists without hypnosis or the sunken place.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t pack the overt racial punch in the gut that Get Out had, but Tyrel provides a nuanced exploration of human behavior and cultural differences that is delivered with a harrowing sense of reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Mitchell (The Chi, Mudbound, Straight Outta Compton) stars as Tyler, who is in need of a break from the hustle and bustle of New York City after his girlfriend\u2019s family takes over their apartment. His friend Johnny (Christopher Abbott) suggests that he hang out with him and his buddies in their Catskills, N.Y., cabin to celebrate the birthday of Pete (Caleb Landry Jones). What appears to be an all-male affair where the bros can indulge in alcohol and conversation slowly devolves into something that Tyler isn\u2019t familiar with. And from unfamiliarity emerges an uncomfortable environment and, eventually, paranoia.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the film\u2019s title of Tyrel, while the protagonist\u2019s name is Tyler, is no mistake and is indicative of the cultural misunderstandings that abound.\n\nDuring their first drunken night at the cabin, Tyler is swiftly sobered up by the collective raucous behavior, with Pete being the most grating and unnerving of the varied personalities. This phase of microaggression isn\u2019t anything new for the group. But for Tyler, it\u2019s foreign territory that doesn\u2019t sit well with him. Rather than endear himself to the group, Tyler instead warms up to Cosmo, the family dog, and hides away from the crew behind his bond with the canine. Eventually, Tyler feigns fatigue and retreats to bed, but Johnny notices that his friend is acting oddly and calls him out for being a party pooper the following morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings don\u2019t get any easier when Alan (a charismatic Michael Cera) arrives to crank up the abrasive behavior another notch. Tyler tries to lose himself in seemingly endless gulps of Irish coffee, but it only heightens his paranoia and uneasiness. While the group of buddies welcome Alan\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s simply too unnerving for Tyler. Silly games that ask Tyler to use a \u201cblack accent,\u201d or when the group mocks religion, pull back the curtain on some racial prejudices that exist within the group. Perhaps none is more damning than when one of the partygoers mistakingly calls the protagonist \u201cTyrel.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Tyler to decide if his discomfort is racial, cultural or just a simple case of struggling to be social. But, ultimately, he realizes that this just isn\u2019t a crowd he can relate to, and it results in his making some irrational decisions as the weekend drags on.\n\nWhile Silva\u2019s film handles this situation very naturally, it lacks the punch of Get Out and opts to stew in its own despondence throughout the 86-minute runtime. It occasionally drags without anything of consequence taking place as the group\u2019s antics swallow up a majority of the screen time. And we don\u2019t really learn much about the partygoers or why they are the way they are, which forces them into one-dimensional characters. You have the gay guy, the eccentric guy, the hard-nosed guy, etc. Names don\u2019t really matter when you can identify them by their actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat truly anchors the film is Mitchell\u2019s performance. He masterfully puts together a character who is a passive and well-intentioned presence and tries his best not to ruin the fun with the uneasiness he feels toward the group. But as the film carries on, their shenanigans wear him down and cause him to question whether or not these actions are designed to unnerve him or if he\u2019s just a little too paranoid about his surroundings. What Mitchell also does extraordinarily well is portray a man who unintentionally uses liquor as a truth serum of sorts. The more alcohol he consumes, the more comfortable he is with calling out their antics. His intoxication is believable as Mitchell handles the inner turmoil of Tyler with exceptional nuance.\n\nIt all leads to a final act where everything comes to a head and leads Tyler to come to grips with his surroundings. The story doesn\u2019t end neatly and seems to take a lot longer to get to the resolution than it actually does. However, it manages to be a tense, and not necessarily amusing, experience that will be digested differently depending on the viewing audience.", "keywords": ["film", "isnt", "guy", "tyrel", "place", "sunken", "mitchell", "dont", "behavior", "sundances", "tyler", "racial", "hypnosis", "group"], "polarity": 0.09661118763391491, "subjectivity": 0.45882220473129554},

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["white", "women", "twitter", "black", "kaepernick", "2017", "won", "tyson", "land", "moments", "la"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

It\u2019s fine to have a different opinion about a movie, but it seems as though White has made a career out of being a contrarian. And as the young people would say, he\u2019s the definition of a hater.\n\nWhite\u2019s review of the film Get Out appeared in the conservative National Review, and he referred to it as a \u201cget whitey\u201d film \u201ctailored to please the liberal status quo.\u201d White also wrote that filmmaker Jordan Peele \u201cmanipulates the Trayvon Martin myth the same way Obama himself did when he pandered by saying, \u2018Trayvon Martin could have been my son.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd White didn\u2019t stop there.

What was different in 2017, more so than any other year in recent memory, was how those polarities were laid bare for everyone else to see.\n\n\n\nIt was the year American streets were crowded with both pussy hats and neo-Nazis. It was the year Confederate monuments were torn from their bases and irate NFL fans cursed at their TVs as black players kneeled en masse. Both \u201ccomplicit\u201d and \u201cfeminism\u201d were designated \u201cwords of the year\u201d (the first by Dictionary.com, the second by Merriam-Webster\u2019s) in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a year that saw the careers of dozens of the world\u2019s most powerful men crash and burn while a man accused of multiple instances of sexual abuse continued to tweet from the Oval Office. It was the year a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. It was the year an alleged pedophile was endorsed by the most powerful man in the free world.\n\nLooking back on the year, no one work sums up the horrors and polarities of the year more than Get Out. It was undoubtedly the movie of 2017: a genre-bending film that managed to feel both timely and overdue. But what makes it not just the film of 2017, but emblematic of it, is best captured in audiences\u2019 divergent reactions to it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Seth Meyers on his late-night show, Allison Williams, who plays the film\u2019s surprise villain, Rose Armitage, describes the reaction she received from white people who had trouble believing that her character, a woman who preyed upon black people, was actually evil:\n\nThey\u2019d say, \u201cShe was hypnotized, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s just evil!\u201d How hard is that to accept? She\u2019s bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she\u2019s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That\u2019s so crazy! And they\u2019re still like, \u201cBut maybe she\u2019s also a victim?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNO! No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence.

Richmond, Democrat from New Orleans and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote a three-page letter Wednesday to Donald Trump declining his invitation to the CBC to meet with him, and outlining the many reasons the group as a whole is saying no.\n\nIn a letter dated June 21 (pdf), Richmond opened by acknowledging the president\u2019s recent request to meet with the CBC:\n\nIn written communication dating back to January 2017, we have shared the priorities of the Caucus as they relate to the Black community. We are serious about the work of advancing the interests of our people and the goals of the CBC. As a result, we took advantage of every opportunity to educate you on the needs of the Black community and provide you with the information and solutions necessary to act on them in good faith. Through an objective assessment, we have seen no evidence that your Administration acted on our calls for action, and we have in fact witnessed steps that will affirmatively hurt Black communities. While we agreed to explore possible future discussions when we first met, it has become abundantly clear that a conversation with the entire CBC would not be entirely productive, given the actions taken by your Administration since our first meeting. While you can solicit the engagement of individual members of our caucus, the CBC as a caucus declines your invitation to meet at this time.\n\nRichmond noted that in March, the CBC presented Trump with a 130-page policy document in order to educate him and his administration on the difficult history of black people in the United States, the history of the CBC and solutions that could help advance black families in the 21st century. The Trump administration has both failed to respond to the policies the CBC outlined and neglected to follow through on its pledge to facilitate meetings between the CBC and relevant Cabinet officials, Richmond said.\n\nIn other words, Trump and his administration have only paid lip service to addressing the needs of black people in the U.S. and never intended to follow through on any of the empty promises that have been made thus far.\n\nIn fact, as Richmond outlined, the administration has acted in opposition to the policy initiatives the caucus has supported, proposing budget cuts to programs that serve low- and moderate-income people, including a $4 billion cut to Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college; and the complete elimination of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \u201cwhich helps seniors and other helpless populations heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the letter, Richmond added:\n\nMoreover, your administration has taken actions that cause legitimate alarm among members of this caucus and the millions of Americans we represent. In a two-page document, your Attorney General issued guidance to federal prosecutors to accelerate the failed war on drugs that will continue to wreck the Black community and exacerbate our nation\u2019s scourge of mass incarceration. Attorney General Sessions has also explicitly stated his unwillingness to utilize consent decrees to protect the civil rights of Americans and has called for an agency-wide review of these agreements. These shortsighted decisions represent willful ignorance by relying on ideology instead of data and compassion. Every dollar we spend on incarceration renders our communities less safe.\n\nIn other words, we see your boy implementing and creating policies that specifically and disproportionately target the black community at large, and this is not a game, Mr. President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Richmond continued, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has caused a number of HBCUs to lose critical funding through the \u201cTRiO\u201d programs (a reference to a number of federal programs intended to help economically disadvantaged students) (pdf), she has refused to protect children from being discriminated against, and she terminated an Obama administration program focused on improving school diversity and student achievement in the lowest-performing schools across the country.\n\nOf course, these atrocities pale in comparison with the decimation of our nation\u2019s health care system. Richmond noted that black people make up 13.3 percent of the U.S. population but 19 percent of Medicaid enrollees, and would therefore be dealt a painful blow by \u201cmean[-spirited]\u201d legislation proposed under the Trump administration.\n\nRichmond went on to outline eight times the CBC has sent written letters to Trump himself and members of his administration, letters that have thus far gone unanswered, because clearly neither the president nor anyone who works for him truly cares about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichmond concluded, \u201cGiven the lack of response to any of the main concerns we have raised with you and your Administration, we decline your invitation for all 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to meet with you. The CBC, and the millions of people we represent, have a lot to lose under your Administration. I fail to see how a social gathering would benefit the policies we advocate for. The CBC will always be willing to engage in discussion and debate about policies and programs that will make America a more perfect union for all.\u201d\n\nIn other words, fuck your photo ops and bullshit promises.\n\nCedric Richmond had the words and the tact to say what we are all thinking in a much nicer way than the president deserves, but he was also direct, pointed and full of facts, and called Trump out for being full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe, \u201cthe blacks,\u201d are tired of the empty promises of the American dream and the \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d We need results that benefit us as much as they benefit those who hold privilege over us.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nEither shit or get off the pot, Donald Trump.", "keywords": ["members", "policies", "administration", "cbc", "black", "dont", "words", "care", "programs", "richmond", "trump", "caucus", "congressional"], "polarity": 0.03136604136604137, "subjectivity": 0.4895652290096733},

In fact, you don\u2019t have to search at all. If you\u2019re sitting on a chair at a cubicle right now or standing in line at Einstein\u2019s Bagels, \u201cperfectly justifiable reasons to hate the New England Patriots\u201d permeate the air and will bounce off your forehead like drops of sleet.\n\nYou can hate them because they\u2019ve been caught cheating numerous times. You can hate them because they seem to receive a mysteriously generous amount of questionable refereeing in their favor. You can hate them because they\u2019re from Boston, which is notorious for possessing the most insufferable (and insufferably racist) sports fans (and people).\n\nYou can hate them because their owner, coach and star quarterback are unabashed \u201cMAGA\u201d bots. You can hate them because they\u2019re really fucking good and they\u2019ve been really fucking good for 15 years despite never really being dominant. I\u2019ve never seen a team that, along with being great, also frequently got so damn lucky, and you can hate them for that. You can hate them because Tom Brady is Scientologist-adjacent. If you want to be petty, you can hate them because Robert Kraft is low-key ugly.\n\nAnd yes, it is fine to hate them because Bill Belichick seems to possess a white-skill-position-player generator. Wes Walker. Rob Gronkowski. Danny Woodhead. Chris Hogan. Julian Edelman. Danny Amendola. Rex Burkhead. THESE ARE NOT THE NAMES OF REAL PEOPLE! THESE ARE THE NAMES OF PEOPLE CREATED BY A WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR. Besides New England, there are, like, three white running backs and receivers in the NFL total. The Patriots, however, have 952 of them.\n\nThis cannot be a coincidence. It just can\u2019t. If you ordered a pepperoni pizza for a party and you opened the box and saw that one slice had 95 pepperonis while the other seven slices had five total, you\u2019d suspect something was up\u2014that the pizza-maker wanted one person to have all the pepperoni. You don\u2019t know why the pizza-maker made this arbitrarily specific decision, but you know a decision was made. SOMEONE IN NEW ENGLAND IS MAKING THE DECISION TO REFRESH THE BATTERIES FOR THE WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, when you have an unusual number of white players on a team\u2014football and basketball particularly\u2014the way they\u2019re talked about changes. Words like \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201chardworking\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d find their way into the columns and comments and news stories about them. They\u2019re \u201cgood locker-room guys\u201d and \u201ccoaches on the field.\u201d They \u201chustle\u201d and they possess an unlimited amount of \u201cguile\u201d and \u201ctoughness.\u201d Their \u201cwork ethics\u201d are impeccable because they\u2019re true \u201cstudents of the game.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Gronkowski is basically white LeBron. And by \u201cwhite LeBron\u201d I mean \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d Or that Danny Woodhead ran a 4.3-second 40.

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

Those who use it in this context can't even feign to deny anymore that they're employing it to evoke a certain type of imagery; that they're specifically attempting to a stoke fear of a Black person (usually male, but occasionally female) whose appearance, actions, and attitudes exude a latent criminality. They say thug, and we're supposed to immediately picture anyone ranging from Colin Kaepernick (because tattoos and uppity) to Kanye West (because Taylor).

These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking.

She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course.

That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed.

This month saw the debut of a web seminar on the same subject, offered by Prof. Tananarive Due and her husband, author Steven Barnes.\n\n\n\nWhen I spoke to Due and Barnes on Skype two weeks ago, they said that the idea for the Sunken Place webinar came from the overwhelming response to the UCLA course. \u201cThe highest number I\u2019ve ever had in [my] Afrofuturism [class] was about 30. And that was a lot of students,\u201d said Due. \u201cI had 60 in my first quarter for Sunken Place, and I have 60 again.

So, I knew if I put that clip on, we could have an earthquake and they wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nBarnes, who was there as well, chimed in with more details: \u201cThere were two doors. And we snuck him in through the back door, we had a seat reserved for him, but he\u2019s wearing the hoodie and a baseball cap and he\u2019s kind of hunched down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter I brought the lights up, I said, \u2018Okay\u2014what did you think the director was trying to say about the coveting of black bodies?\u2019\u201d Due continued. \u201cAnd he raises his hand in the back, and he\u2019s like, \u2018I have a question.\u2019 And he stood up, walked to the front of the room, and the class, in waves, just went crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne student ran out of the classroom, sobbing,\u201d Barnes said. Says Due, \u201cI was like, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 And she was just going to the hall to walk it off and get herself re-centered so she could come back. And what was fantastic about it, was that I really got the sense that it wasn\u2019t just \u2018Jordan Peele from Key & Peele\u2019 kind of love he was getting.

If you\u2019re willing to speak a dangerous truth, and you\u2019ve got the skill to do it right, there is real opportunity.\u201d\n\nPart of why Get Out resonates so much is because it gets at what\u2019s been called America\u2019s birth defect, which is to say the slave trade and its legacies. \u201cPolitics are the way you actualize or mobilize philosophy. You know, the question\u2014the core questions of philosophy are, \u2018Who am I?\u2019, \u2018What is true?\u2019, and \u2018What is the basic nature of mankind?\u2019\u201d Barnes offers. \u201cAnd in race in America, the basic question was, \u2018Who are we? What are we?\u2019 In other words, does nature trump nurture? Does essence precede existence?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSlavery was based upon the assumption of inferiority,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe emancipation did not say black people were equal. The emancipation said we should not treat these poor people this badly. We\u2019re still dealing with that question of inferiority. I think that up until 1970, and the Voting Rights Act, we were not even full citizens in America. That was when the conversation really began to turn towards, \u2018Are we actually equal? What are the implications of that?\u2019 and, \u2018How much guilt do we need to feel as a nation about the way they\u2019ve been treated if they\u2019re actually equal?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Get Out does,\u201d Due said, \u201cis allegorically document white supremacy and its effects on black Americans. It\u2019s from slavery\u2014metaphorically, you can look at that\u2014Jordan Peele talked about the sunken place about being an interpretation of mass incarceration. But I think you can also extrapolate slavery. The theft of black bodies for labor. In this case, it was the theft of black bodies just to enhance their lives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that though Due is still teaching it, the online version of the course is not affiliated with UCLA\u2014and there are no exams or graded essays, either. \u201cThere is homework that we will expect students to keep up with,\u201d she says, \u201cbut why take the class if you\u2019re not going to do the homework, right?\u201d Homework largely consists of watching a roster of films. \u201cInstead of one film a week, like I had my UCLA students do, online they\u2019ll be doing more like two films a week,\u201d she notes. The reading portion is mostly made up of short stories. \u201cIt\u2019s an overview course, where the lynchpin is Get Out. Because Get Out\u2014not only because of its success\u2014gives us a common point of conversation, and encompasses to much of what I call the black horror aesthetic. Which is using that allegory as a way of processing everything from slavery, to white supremacy and whatever racialized trauma.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI talked to Due and Barnes weeks ago, after Get Out got shut out at the 2018 Golden Globes, and asked them I asked them what they thought the prospects of an Oscar nomination were. They were optimistic and they also ended up being right:\n\nTananarive Due: I really believe very strongly that Get Out will get, not one, but at least a couple Oscar nominations. I would be shocked if it doesn\u2019t get a Best Original Screenplay. Steven Barnes: I would say that that\u2019s pretty close to a lock. Due: And aside from that, there\u2019s talk of Best Picture. There\u2019s talk of Daniel Kaluuya as Best Lead Actor. So there may be some other nominations. I don\u2019t know how to explain exactly what happened at the Golden Globes. First of all, let me preface it this way \u2014 I don\u2019t know how significant the Golden Globes are as a forecast of the Oscars. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s helpful. And I know it probably can\u2019t hurt. But the voting base is so different. I mean \u2014 can you really think its more important when you look at Writers Guild Awards, and stuff like that.\n\n\u2018But having said that, I\u2019m sure everyone would have loved it if the film had won, or if Daniel Kaluuya had won. Um... it\u2019s tough. Their categorization process is awkward? So that might be some of it. I saw a lot of people obviously will assume it\u2019s sort of a racial shut out, because people don\u2019t want to look at the things that Get Out put out in people\u2019s faces. There may be some truth to that. Or maybe an aversion to even seeing the film, because you can see from the trailer, \u201cOh, this might make me uncomfortable.\u201d You know? In fact, I think I said that to someone at a party. Barnes: I think its possible to look at it in at least two different ways \u2014 one is simply the practical way of how a single film doesn\u2019t give us enough data to know whether or not it\u2019s lost. But it\u2019s also possible to look into the framework of a history of films of certain political points of view being excluded or discounted. Or psychologically, black people understand that movie on a different level. Actually, there was one guy who was just going on, \u201cwhoever did this movie has no idea about race relations in America\u201d. You know? Just a white guy who thinks he understands what he doesn\u2019t understand. The Dunning-Kruger effect. Ignorance masquerading as wisdom. That we get what Jordan Peele was doing to the point where, whatever qualities are in that film, it is lifted up by our understanding of the truth that is being given to us. It\u2019s like we look at this movie, and \u201cOh my God,\u201d someone is speaking the unspeakable. This isn\u2019t a joke.\n\nDue: Someone said it. But this also the thing\u2014besides the racial possible handicap\u2014it\u2019s also a horror film. And as someone tweeted...I wish I could cite the tweet I saw earlier...where some guy was saying, \u201cOh, those of you who are upset about Get Out being shut out of the Oscars, welcome to being a horror fan.\u201d So there are a lot of people who will not take horror films seriously.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Get Out received four nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor. The Oscars are on March 4.)\n\nElaborating on the specifics of the online seminar, Due says they\u2019re hoping to get Peele and Candyman lead actor Tony Todd to appear as they did in the UCLA class. \u201cBut it\u2019s more lecture and discussion-based than special guest-based at this point,\u201d Due says. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly lectures and deep dives into the themes of not only Get Out, but also Candyman, Ganja and Hess\u2014that movie\u2019s take on the vampire mythos\u2014and Beloved.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen asked who might be the ideal people to take the Sunken Place seminar, Barnes singled out three populations. \u201cOne is just the fans who want to understand and have a wider context and deeper understanding of the roots of horror, black horror in America, and our transition from being the monsters in Birth of a Nation to being the ones who fight the monsters. That\u2019s an amazing, heroic journey that we have taken in this country,\u201d he began. \u201cWe also want to be a resource for teachers of black horror to provide them with context, to deepen them, so that they can in turn reach out and touch other people. But also, we want to impact the next generation of the creators of black horror.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really do think horror is significant socially, period, and has a way of providing a lens that few other kinds of art can. Black horror in particular is especially powerful that way. And I want to spread it like a virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all stand on giants,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cBut someone like Jordan Peele has created very broad shoulders, indeed. And so if we understand what he has done\u2014and what some of these other people have done, like what Tony Todd says about the way he approached the acting in Candyman, and what this means to him\u2014it changes things. You\u2019re no longer looking at the surface of the question, now you\u2019re looking underneath. You\u2019re popping up the hood and looking at the actual engine that makes that car work. Most people are just looking at the finish, the color, the paint. Let\u2019s look at the power train. How this works. Why this works. How this can be something that is a transformative experience, culturally. That\u2019s different.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI really do think horror is significant socially, period, and has a way of providing a lens that few other kinds of art can,\u201d said Due. \u201cBlack horror in particular is especially powerful that way. And I want to spread it like a virus. One of the things that was most exciting to me about the UCLA course was that I gave my students the opportunity to write either an essay, or a short story, or make a short film. And in the past, I\u2019ve never had anyone make a film. A few people have written stories. This past year, I got several stories. I got two excellent films. And it just showed me, when you open that door of enlightenment and teach students how to take the feelings that they already have, but express them through horror, boom, we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue said she and Barnes want to help create artists. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of what we want to do, and who we are. So, while it\u2019s more of an academically-oriented course, I hope that through that better intellectual understanding of the material, it will help artists open up their imaginations about how they can take their truth\u2014like Jordan Peele took his truth\u2014and create art with social impact.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo find out how to register for the \u201cThe Sunken Place\u201d web seminar, go here.", "keywords": ["horror", "know", "film", "class", "online", "inspired", "barnes", "think", "way", "black", "students", "college", "course", "anybody", "peele", "version"], "polarity": 0.10579354851906406, "subjectivity": 0.4737300564555716},

She had permission to do so from the apartment\u2019s managers, yet Kushner\u2019s company sued her years later for breaking the lease, winning more than $3,000 plus fees and expenses: almost $5,000 total by 2014.\n\n\u201cAt one point in the story, a private investigator looking into Westminster Management, [Kushner\u2019s] property management company says, \u2018they\u2019re nothing but slumlords.\u2019 MacGillis notes the P.I. is a Trump supporter and had no idea of the connection between Trump\u2019s son-in-law and Westminster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMacGillis finds hundreds of cases, and the story profiles several other tenants with similar experiences. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Times website had recorded nearly 700 comments on the story by Wednesday night.\n\nTrump Budget a \u2018Crackdown on the Neediest\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has set one goal that all Americans can get behind, and that\u2019s making the sluggish U.S. economy grow faster,\u201d the Los Angeles Times editorialized on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe editorial also said, \u201cBut rather than grapple with some of the challenges underlying the disappearance of millions of Americans from the workforce \u2014 in particular, the technological changes and globalization that have caused so many blue-collar and middle-class jobs to evaporate, and the gap between the education and training Americans have received and the skills demanded by today\u2019s employers \u2014 the Trump budget seeks to force people back into the workforce by making it harder to obtain or keep food stamps, Medicaid and Social Security disability benefits, while reducing federal support for welfare and children\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cThe crackdown on the neediest and most vulnerable seems even more craven when considering the billions Trump\u2019s budget would shower on defense, border security and tax cuts for high-income Americans, corporations and partnerships. . . .\u201d\n\n. . .

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["magical", "movie", "white", "church", "magically", "negro", "negrod", "charlie", "mother", "mr", "shit", "does", "reasons"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Because not only the pageant world, but the beauty industry as a whole has been making some major progress toward diversity.\n\nGIF\n\nEarly last fall, mega-brand CoverGirl shed its classic \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful\u201d slogan for a fiercer campaign: \u201cI am what I make up.\u201d The brand also ushered in six new badass ambassadors\u2014including Issa Rae\u2014who bring their new mission of inclusivity front and center. And no current beauty conversation would be complete without mentioning Rihanna\u2019s September launch of Fenty Beauty. The launch shook the beauty community to its core, not only breaking the internet but also dispelling some long-held myths surrounding black women and makeup.\n\nSo why, in this melanin-winning back-to-back, inclusivity-embracing, post-Fenty era, are major brands still launching half-assed, lame attempts at diversity?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Tarte Cosmetics, a popular brand known for its cult favorite Shape Tape concealer, launched the highly anticipated Shape Tape foundation. For weeks, Tarte built up the hype for the release with teaser emails and clickbait posts. So imagine the disappointment when thousands of followers flocked to the site, credit card in hand, ready to purchase, only to discover 13 shades of beige and two shades formulated for \u201cricher skintones.\u201d Swatches pictured online were tweeted and retweeted relentlessly.\n\nThe dragging that ensued on Tarte\u2019s timeline was not only epic but truly entertaining. The company eventually had to disable both its Instagram and Twitter comments in an attempt to silence all the negative publicity. Days after throwing shade at Fenty, rationalizing, doubling down on its stance and ignoring its customer base didn\u2019t work, the brand finally relented by posting a response to the outrage on Popsugar, promising more shades to come in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn interesting post from POPSUGAR Beauty. Check it out! Read more Read\n\nBut by then it was already too late. Beauty influencers like Jackie Aina, Makeupshayla and Alissa Ashley took to their social media accounts and promptly got to roasting. It was so delicious, I almost stopped the videos to go grab marshmallows from the kitchen (every good roast has marshmallows).\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s sad, really. Women of color have long been conditioned by makeup brands to be OK with being an afterthought. These manufacturers put little to no effort into the formulation of our shades, or the inclusion of more-diverse models. Instead, we\u2019ve typically been told:\n\n\n\nWomen of color typically don\u2019t invest in luxury makeup brands, meaning those shades don\u2019t sell.\n\n\n\nDeeper shades are more difficult to formulate.\n\n\n\nRicher colors will come out in future launches. We want to see how the product tests in the market first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in the past, we\u2019ve accepted these excuses as fact \u2026 until Fenty proved that the rhetoric was wrong:\n\n\n\nWomen of color historically didn\u2019t buy expensive brands because the three shitty shades you offered didn\u2019t match or wear well. As one Twitter user stated, \u201cif you only offer red, red as hell and what the hell, I\u2019m going to opt out.\u201d I can get the same horrible look with drugstore brands. I\u2019ll keep my $40. THANKS.\n\n\n\nIf you can formulate deeper eye shadow, lipstick and bronzer shades, then it stands to reason that foundation shades are not that much different. You employ chemists. Why am I mixing shades in my bathroom to try to get a perfect match? I\u2019m not Walter White.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhy should we have to wait for a future launch when the Christian Grey-worthy 50 shades of beige you just released could have been cut in half, and replaced with five to 10 deeper shades with golden, olive and neutral undertones?\n\n\n\nIn the end, it basically all comes down to one thing: SHADE.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarte just so happens to be the company that took the dragging this go-round, but far too many brands continue to operate in this manner. I remember rushing out and purchasing the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, after hearing dozens of girls rave about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t add color,\u201d has zero flashback in pictures and sets your makeup to perfection. Lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powder is stark white. It not only adds a white cast, but if you\u2019re any darker than Denise Huxtable, it\u2019ll have you looking casket ready, if you\u2019re not careful. That was at least five years ago. The brand JUST came out with ONE chocolate-girl-friendly shade last year.\n\n\n\nWomen of color are no longer being silent about their discontent. The bar has been raised, and your three obligatory WOC-friendly shades\u2014chestnut, mahogany and espresso\u2014are no longer going to cut it.

No, it does not. If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["know", "white", "allies", "speak", "work", "flight", "dont", "airport", "need", "world", "going", "im", "men", "enemies"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

Blige is a revelation as a matriarch. It excels in large part because of its dedication to authenticity, including how whites treated black folks (and how blacks had to treat whites in order to survive) in the Jim Crow South. The rage-whitening of your black knuckles only intensifies as the movie creeps toward its climax, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re left with the residue of anger at our treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain period films allow us to escape to days long past with a relative certainty that the technology, mindsets and quality of life portrayed have permanently evolved, but black Americans\u2014most of whom, at the very least, have living parents or grandparents who faced legal consequences for using the same toilet as white people\u2014aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of viewing such things passively. Mudbound is set some seven decades ago, but in a #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, tiki-torch, George Zimmerman-still-walks-as-a-free-man America that reminds you just how little shit has changed since then, it\u2019s not so easy to divorce oneself from the fact that it\u2019s just a movie.\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s a metric-ass ton of films that evoke these feelings within us. Damon Young created a list a few years back, but he only scratched the surface of what could easily be a 5,000-word article. So here\u2019s a very nonexhaustive list of films that make me kinda wanna trip Kaitlyn as she strolls out of Lululemon:\n\nDetroit (2017)\n\nAudiences pretty much steered clear of this film, which is based on the 1967 Detroit rebellion, likely because they heard that the middle hour is like a Saw film for racially motivated police brutality. Detroit is actually a decent film, and I was one of the few black reviewers who gave it praise. But after watching a press screening, I skipped out on the star-studded world premiere for the same reason I\u2019ll likely never watch the film again: because ain\u2019t nobody got time to be miserable for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder in Mississippi (1990)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie starring Blair Underwood traumatized me when I was a young child with an inchoate understanding of racism. Based on the real-life murder of civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, the film\u2019s protagonists inspired 8-year-old me before I had to watch them get dragged out of their vehicles and executed in the conclusion. They might as well have clipped Mr. Rogers in front of me. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on this film for the better part of 30 years, but it\u2019s the only reason I refused to stop for gas when driving through Mississippi at night while in my 20s.\n\n\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nIt\u2019s not always the films that feature explicit white-on-black violence. Dead Presidents masterfully depicts the black American condition as it\u2019s affected by the sublimation of overt racism: Young black and brown men fight the white man\u2019s war (Vietnam here, but isn\u2019t every war the white man\u2019s war?), only to return home with addictions, illness, injuries, emotional trauma and scarce financial options. Not even the liberal use of Terrence Howard\u2019s \u201cmayne,\u201d Clifton Powell\u2019s \u201cnyuguh\u201d or the best soundtrack ever make the conclusion less depressing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican History X (1998)\n\nThough it\u2019s in my top 10 all-time favorite films, this white nationalist redemption tale is never too easy to take in. Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard is a nasty Nazi bastard before eventually becoming a sympathetic character, and Stacy Keach\u2019s predatory patriarch motivating children to hate is infuriating. And of course, there\u2019s that curbside scene\u2014hit the \u201cplay\u201d button on the above video if you, too, wish to be pissed off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitch Perfect movies\n\nIncluded in this list because I can\u2019t think of a series that better personifies the unbridled caucasity that is the Hollywood machine than one that portrays the \u201ccompetitive\u201d world of collegiate a cappella as comedy. The industry is doing a better-than-ever job of green-lighting the stories of marginalized voices, and Moonlight getting the Oscars drop on Fluffernutter-sandwich-turned-cinematic-experience La La Land was monumental. But it\u2019s still tough to see Pitch Perfect films being made even when no one asked for them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nPretty much every white person in Jordan Peele\u2019s blockbuster is written to appall. But there\u2019s a unique animus that should be reserved for Allison Williams\u2019 Rose Armitage, the (spoiler alert) main cog in the machine of a family that subverts and \u201ctransforms\u201d black folks into modern-day slaves. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 \u2026 she should\u2019ve gotten it much worse in the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nMuch has been written about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s liberal use of the n-word in his films, but few will argue that the man can\u2019t write a good revenge tale. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s unctuous plantation owner is impressively reprehensible as a man who forces his slaves to participate in some ungodly mixed martial arts for his amusement. But it\u2019s the scene in which dogs tear a slave to pieces that makes us root for Jamie Foxx\u2019s Django to snatch the life of every human of European descent on-screen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurviving the Game (1994)\n\nAn entire movie centered on rich white men (and Charles S. \u201cRoc\u201d Dutton) hunting a homeless black man for sport. Get past the action-thriller aspect of the film (which isn\u2019t too shabby for the early 1990s) and focus on the optics of Ice-T\u2019s down-on-his-luck widower thinking he\u2019s catching a break at the hands of some well-meaning white folks who are all betting on being the first to off him. It\u2019s fitting that Rutger Hauer, the poster boy for Hollywood bad guys whom you\u2019d probably steer clear of in real life, plays the main antagonist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewood (1997)\n\nYeah, I know Damon has this on his list. But John Singleton\u2019s best film not named Boyz n the Hood remains the gold standard of don\u2019t-bring-your-Anglo-ass-anywhere-within-10-yards-of-me-after-I-watch-this filmmaking. Based on a real-life 1920s massacre following the lie of a white woman on a black man, not many films before or since Rosewood have so unflinchingly depicted raw white brutality on black bodies. Every time I find myself thinking I want to rewatch it, I think about how I actually plan to walk outside my crib and interact with these motherfuckers again at some point.", "keywords": ["white", "film", "folks", "films", "theres", "black", "man", "young", "mudbound", "world", "war", "pissed", "list"], "polarity": 0.05818222202368542, "subjectivity": 0.45249218261413376},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

As Bethune-Cookman University graduates loudly booed U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos during her remarks at the school\u2019s commencement ceremony Wednesday morning, university President Edison Jackson threatened to withhold their degrees.\n\n\u201cIf this behavior continues,\u201d Jackson said angrily as DeVos uncomfortably stood beside him with a smile frozen on her face, \u201cyour degrees will be mailed to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoose which way you want to go,\u201d Jackson warned.\n\nThe students ignored Jackson\u2019s threats and continued to boo DeVos. Some even stood with their backs to her, fists raised in the air as she continued her speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Florida chapter of the NAACP anticipated Jackson\u2019s actions in a statement released Monday that called for his immediate resignation and that of Board Chairman Joe Petrock.\n\n\u201cSince our initial public outcry last week, multiple allegations have surfaced including faculty intimidation demanding their silence or risk termination and threats to students by potentially withholding earned degrees and fines for freedom of expression,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIf these allegations are proven, this contrasts the public statements of university administration who opposes suppressing voices by welcoming U.S. Education Secretary DeVos but lends indirect support to these actions against faculty and students.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people with common sense questioned the choice of DeVos for commencement speaker, especially in light of her comments earlier this year when she referred to HBCUs as \u201cpioneers\u201d in school choice and said that they gave black students more options to pursue higher education.\n\n\n\nWith that being said, it is still entirely puzzling why anyone thought that not only inviting DeVos to the commencement ceremony but also honoring her would be a good idea. However, Jackson\u2019s attendance at a meeting with President Donald Trump in February, along with dozens of other HBCU leaders, may provide the answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI truly believe that meaningful progress for our schools requires relationships,\u201d said Jackson in a statement published on Bethune-Cookman\u2019s website following the meeting. \u201cHBCUs must have a voice in Washington. We must do all that we can to ensure the success of our colleges and universities. The meeting was productive and definitely a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nClearly not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Monday\u2019s statement by the NAACP Florida State Conference, Adora Obi Nweze, president of the conference and member of the National Board of Directors, called the decision to invite DeVos a drastic fumble.\n\n\u201cWith the recent comments of President Trump suggesting federal funding for HBCUs is unconstitutional, this validates our view of a horrible decision by the university inviting Secretary DeVos, who still has not pledged to drastically increase funding for all historically black colleges and universities. The university leadership has drastically fumbled and should resign,\u201d Nweze said.\n\n\n\nWhatever the reason behind Jackson\u2019s decision to invite an enemy of HBCUs into the students\u2019 midst, I was entirely pleased with all the videos that came down the Twitter timeline showing them resisting.", "keywords": ["university", "boos", "naacp", "jackson", "hbcus", "threatens", "loud", "statement", "students", "betsy", "secretary", "bethunecookman", "president", "jacksons", "degrees", "devos", "withhold"], "polarity": 0.04875116713352007, "subjectivity": 0.49589169000933697},

Word on the White House streets is that \u201calt-right\u201d white supremacist fanboy and self-proclaimed \u201ceconomic nationalist\u201d Steve Bannon might be out of President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle and (hopefully) the White House altogether as Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, consolidates power.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first raised the possibility Friday, reporting that both Bannon and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus might be relieved of their current roles\u2014Priebus because of the rocky first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency; Bannon because of West Wing infighting with Kushner and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, who may be up for Priebus\u2019 job.\n\nAs further evidence of Bannon\u2019s fall from grace, CNN noted that during Trump\u2019s dinner with President Xi Jinping of China, the table seating may have indicated a \u201ctelling tableau.\u201d\n\n\n\nKushner was seated next to Jinping\u2019s wife\u2014two seats down from Trump himself\u2014while Bannon was seated further down, \u201csandwiched between two Chinese officials.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tea? While Bannon still has a seat at the table, his position seems to be slipping.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, Bannon lost his position on the National Security Council, to the relief of many, who see the former editor of the far-right news outlet Breitbart as a radical, racist and sexist puppet master who knows no good. CNN reports that it was Kushner who made that happen.\n\nAl-Jazeera outlined three repercussions of Bannon being off the NSC:\n\n\n\nFirst, Bannon\u2019s ousting will ultimately disengage populism from national security policy and will create a dividing line between Trump\u2019s domestic political turmoil and his foreign policy. Second, the national security establishment that Trump has long criticized is gradually turning the White House into a conventional U.S. administration. Third, we no longer have a separation between national and homeland security that has misguided Trump\u2019s campaign narrative \u2026\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House, of course, denies that Bannon (or Priebus) is going anywhere and issued a statement Friday night, according to CNN. From White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters:\n\nOnce again, this is a completely false story driven by people who want to distract from the success taking place in this administration. The president\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court (a decision that has generational impact) was confirmed today, we hosted multiple foreign leaders this week and the president took bold and decisive military action against Syria last night. The only thing we are shaking up is the way Washington operates as we push the president\u2019s aggressive agenda forward.\n\nWe shall see. But when there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s usually fire.

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people. And not giving enough of a shit to notice.", "keywords": ["didnt", "white", "type", "day", "person", "way", "floor", "black", "youd", "learn", "better", "things", "werent", "guest"], "polarity": 0.016623178951946087, "subjectivity": 0.4481680800173951},

And they got in some zingers, too.\n\nBut otherwise, it was black goose eggs.\n\nEven Black-ish lost. So did Issa Rae, Mary J. Blige, Octavia Spencer, Anthony Anderson and Daniel Kaluuya. Get Out also lost. And so did Denzel Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the bright side, the award for best actor in a comedy series went to fellow brown man Aziz Ansari for Master of None, which kind of made Lena Waithe award-adjacent, because she writes for and stars in the show.\n\nBut it was Oprah who, in that distinctive Oprah voice, brought the rapture. She received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for her outsize contribution to entertainment, putting her in the company of Hollywood legends like Steven Spielberg, Robin Williams, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier (Oprah began her speech by referencing Poitier).\n\nShe called the name of Rosa Parks. She told the harrowing story of Recy Taylor, a black woman gang-raped in Alabama many years ago. She bigged up the press, and then she took the children to church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times. Which brings me to this,\u201d Oprah said, pausing, and then giving us this:\n\nWhat I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. But it\u2019s not just a story affecting the entertainment industry, it\u2019s one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics or workplace. So I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They\u2019re the women whose names we\u2019ll never know; they are domestic workers and farmworkers. They are working in factories and they work in restaurants and they\u2019re in academia and engineering and medicine and science. They are part of the world of tech and politics and business. They are athletes in the Olympics and they are soldiers in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then she came back to Taylor.\n\n\u201cShe came back to live, as we all have lived, in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. The time is up!\u201d Oprah roared.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe audience leaped to their feet.

I've read several articles about this because I've honestly been trying to understand and what I've come up with is that there is no understanding to be had. Why an HBCU would chose to pick a member of Trump's administration so aggressively hostile towards minority communities and, frankly, actual education, is beyond me.\n\nI don't know if common sense is on vacation, and recent ads for damn near everything insinuate that to the be the case, but an actual Black institution of higher learning taking such a transparent stance towards ass kissing is embarrassing. That is the only plausible reason why anybody from this administration would be asked, especially Betsy DeVos, a woman who released an ENTIRE press release that explicitly outlined her lack of knowledge about why HBCUs even exist.\n\nLet her come to the school to sit down and be educated. Giving her the country to come and speak to a legion of new graduates is tone deaf in a way that would be impressive if it wasn't so sad.\n\nBut not quite as sad as this shit:\n\nIn a news release Monday, the university said: \u201cMuch like Dr. Bethune, Founder of Bethune-Cookman University, Secretary DeVos deems the importance of opportunity and hope for students to receive an exceptional education experience. Her mission to empower parents and students resonates with the history and legacy of Dr. Bethune.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoy stop. Mary McLeod Bethune probably sat up in her grave at the comparison. Also, shit, you could say that about ANYBODY who believes good schooling is a win. There are people who HATE school who are like, \"I mean, if you're gonna have school, it is important for opportunity and hope and shit.\" Jaden Smith would agree with that and I think he's viewed school as some sort of telepathic bridge to nowhere since he was like four. In that case, Mary McLeod Bethune and Jaden Smith\u2026same shit.\n\nI will extend some grace, Lord knows we all need it, and assume that BC did this for some reason that belies logic BUT was done with pure altruism at heart. Maybe Betsy said that she'd promise them a new, I don't know, research center if they'd let her come speak because nobody else wants to hear shit she has to say. I have no clue. And statements like this, \"The release also noted the importance of funding from the Education Department, and praised DeVos for her charitable contributions\" somewhat alludes to SOMETHING along those lines.\n\nWhile there are way worse individuals to have come speak to your institution - Richard Spencer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Ben Casron, etc. all immediately come to mind\u2026you know what, Ben Carson shouldn't be an option but if you HAVE to pick somebody from the administration at least he DID positively impact the world at some point and is Black even if his relationship with what slavery actually was is tenuous. He pretty much lit his entire pre-political career on fire, but I'm saying, if we ARE extending invites and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, Bethune-Cookman University should be ashamed. Yes, this will be a non-thing in a few weeks. Nobody is coming from far and wide to hear her speak. And it also seems like her speaking is going to happen no matter what petitions or protests exist. Plus, are you going to skip out on your graduation because of the speaker? I think not. Perhaps a flash mob style insertion of ear plugs when she started speaking could be an effective tool of silent protest. Yo no se.\n\nThen again, my alma mater has Van Jones speaking and I guess he can't stop stepping in shit either though I'd imagine the weight of sensibility is weighing pretty heavily in Morehouse's favor in comparison. Of course, Spelman College has Valerie Jarrett and Howard University has Kamala Harris.

Perhaps when you\u2019re a boorish hatemonger who speaks as if his tongue had a stroke while trying to cross over from a fourth-grade reading level to a fifth-grade reading level, not shouting while reading from a teleprompter is quite the deal.\n\nWhatever the case, for those who did find 45\u2019s speech impressive, there\u2019s already a narrative conveniently floating as to who is responsible for this purported shift: Ivanka Trump.\n\n\n\nIn a Reuters piece titled, \u201cBehind Scenes, Ivanka Encouraged Trump\u2019s Change of Tone: Sources,\u201d we are once again subjected to the fable about daughter dearest being the calmer, moderate voice in 45\u2019s inner circle. Reuters reporters Steve Holland and John Walcott note that per a senior White House official, during a brainstorming session in the Oval Office Sunday, it was Ivanka who assisted her father in alleviating concerns about his temperament and whether he could govern effectively.\n\nThe source explained:\n\nHe had a lot of voices around him giving him ideas and suggestions that he incorporated, but he really set out to achieve that optimistic tone and that was something she was supportive of. She encouraged him to do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother source said:\n\nShe had a role. She helped set the tone.\n\nAnd:\n\nHer fingerprints are visible on the tone, but especially on those parts of it like maternity leave that matter to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, as Melania Trump was somewhere avoiding everything to do with the publicity stunt that won a presidency, it was 45\u2019s one true love saying, \u201cNo, Daddy, inside voices! Evil is delivered way better when the delivery isn\u2019t so elevated in volume. Oh, and please mention new mommies!\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s totally plausible to believe that Ivanka give her father a few tips, the problem lies in the clear intent behind this story.\n\nIt boggles the mind how she successfully manages to get outlets to repeatedly write stories about her as if she is some liberal, despite no evidence to support such categorization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are so many generous reports that claim Ivanka had spoken like a Democrat on the campaign trial\u2014including at the Republican National Convention. Still, saying that women deserve maternity leave and that child care matters doesn\u2019t make you a progressive. Neither does vacationing with a rich Democrat, as she and her power-hungry misclassified husband, Jared Kushner, have done recently. The same goes for giving money to Democratic candidates. After all, her father said he gave to both Democrats and Republicans because as a businessman, it\u2019s smart to have friends on both sides.\n\nThese days, if you don\u2019t hate people having health care, don\u2019t hang out with white supremacists, and don\u2019t complain about there being a BET Awards and not a WET Awards, some might proclaim that you sound like a Democrat. Not all of us share these low expectations, though. Ivanka herself said that she doesn\u2019t claim to be a Democrat or a Republican, but that falls in line with most \u201cindependents\u201d who are merely people with both political ideologies and commitment issues.\n\nYet, without nary a sign of a receipt, Ivanka Trump gets christened liberal or moderate or not dead inside, like her daddy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust look at how Holland and Walcott describe her in the piece:\n\nIvanka Trump, 35, the president\u2019s older daughter, has emerged as an influential informal adviser for her father, particularly on issues important to women and minorities.\n\nI need an Amber Alert to help locate what the fuck these two are talking about.\n\n\n\nThere are a few things to appreciate about Ivanka Trump. She doesn\u2019t look as stupid as her brother Eric. She\u2019s not as smug and obvious with her political ambitions as Donald Jr. She\u2019s not Tiffany Trump, bless her heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s less worth making note of is her supposed advocacy on behalf of women and minorities. With respect to women, if you are not white or well-connected; if you don\u2019t believe in not challenging a reductive view of womanhood so much as learning to thrive within the structure without making too much of a fuss, or in anything else that fits into Ivanka\u2019s overall myopic views on gender and career, is she advocating on your behalf? There is a reason why she has been called out on just who she means by \u201c#womenwhowork,\u201d and why some women have boycotted her products altogether.\n\nIf you\u2019re a minority, have you seen Ivanka mention Black Lives Matter, Islamophobia, the children in schools across the country being subjected to taunts about being deported ? Ivanka has asked for \u201ctolerance\u201d in light of the increased bomb threats aimed at Jewish Community Centers. As a convert to Judaism, that makes sense because it impacts her directly. Therein lies the problem: She typically only speaks about issues that affect her directly or that have proved to be the least controversial.\n\nWe hear that she wants to speak about climate change. We know that she has a desire to discuss human trafficking. These are important matters, but they do not negate that she purposely seeks ways to build her political clout without alienating Republicans or Democrats alike. Plenty of political consultants will call that smart, but should anyone honestly package her as a fighter for women and minorities?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome have rightly rallied against the myth of Ivanka\u2019s liberalism throughout the campaign trial, but it keeps popping back as if it\u2019s the herpes bump to the lip of our news cycle. To wit, Politico ran a story about Ivanka and Kushner staying noticeably silent as the White House rolled back protections for transgender kids in schools. Why is their silence presented as surprising?\n\nWhether or not she wants to admit it, it\u2019s pretty apparent that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have political ambitions that exceed this administration. Her dad may be an ogre who may very well see his presidency go the way of his casinos and other failed businesses, but Ivanka is far shrewder than her father.\n\nShe is poised. She is regarded as elegant. She is more disciplined than her dad and siblings. That is what makes her so scary. She looks exactly like the kind of woman the Republicans would nominate for president. She looks like someone this country would vote for as president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe benefits from so many things as a well-off, well-connected white woman who subscribes to tradition. There\u2019s not much any of us can do to compete with that. What we can do, however, is continue to gnaw away at this false image of Ivanka.\n\nLike her father, Ivanka is an opportunist. Like her father, she is willing to exploit racism for gain. Make no mistake: Being a bystander in unabashed bigotry without speaking against it makes you just as culpable. In her case, even more so, given that she\u2019s using her position as first daughter to find her own political footing. And like her father, she benefits from being associated with liberalism without touting, let alone living, any of its virtues.\n\nFor the longest time, 45 professed to be a Democrat and was deemed a New York liberal. How did that turn out? For a child who\u2019s long patterned herself after her father, don\u2019t you think she knows how history can repeat itself?", "keywords": ["white", "folks", "women", "democrat", "ivanka", "shes", "think", "political", "filtered", "tone", "dont", "father", "trump", "version", "dad"], "polarity": 0.11233766233766233, "subjectivity": 0.4633384767048133},

Also, it\u2019s a groupthink catchphrase.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m probably \u201capologetically black,\u201d because, in my most honest moments, unfettered by the societal implications of class, race and social status, I must admit ... I kinda feel sorry for white people.

The posters are all branded by the St. Cloud State White Student Union, although the college says it is not a registered organization on campus.\n\nHowever, the organization has a Facebook page named St. Cloud White Student Union and describes itself as such:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not even mad at the St. Cloud State White Student Union; I\u2019m just confused. Apparently, I have been spending my time in the wrong places because I\u2019m never around when people gang up to oppress the populace of ecru-colored martyrs.\n\nI was involved in the Black Student Union while I was in college, but I\u2019d love to attend a White Student Union event. Do they play pinochle like we play spades? Do they discuss how hard it is being white in Minnesota surrounded by so many other alabasterians? Are their field trips to kale farms and HWCUs? Do they throw an off-step show every year for the fraternities and sororities?\n\nOnce, at a Denny\u2019s around 3 a.m. in Goose Creek, S.C., while watching a 52-year-old white dude mop up a drunken white sorority girl\u2019s grits-vomit, I wondered what kind of crazy Caucasian hijinks he was involved in that led to waiting tables during the graveyard shift at a pancake restaurant, when he has every societal advantage and privilege. I mean, he was white! The throw-up girl wasn\u2019t even with me, but as I watched him roll that canary-yellow industrial mop bucket filled with water the color of disappointment and bad decisions, I said a silent prayer for that waiter, and then I told him I was sorry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike I said, I am apologetically black.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud State Student Union Facebook page seems to be disliked by most people, and the college and the city of St. Cloud have condemned the posters. Not because they are racist, but because the signs violate the town ordinance against stapling things to telephone poles. What would they expect from those thugs?\n\nBut for the record, I stand with the White Student Union. Someone has to do it. I can\u2019t imagine having control of the media; every part of the local, state and national government; the education system, the banking system, the economy; and politics and the entire damn country and still feeling sorry for myself like a 6-year-old who can\u2019t get an ice cream cone because he\u2019s already eaten too many cookies.

I\u2019m not a fan of Fenty foundation. *Ducks.*\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m enthralled by the range of shades, the marketing, beautiful packaging and even the specially trained Fenty specialists who color-matched me in Sephora. But after three tries, I had to accept that this foundation and I just weren\u2019t a match\u2014in tone or texture\u2014though I kept the bottle on GP. (I foundation-hack it; more on that later.)\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t anything else to fall in love with in this launch. Determined to invest my dollars in some black-tastic beauty, I found four instant and now indispensable favorites to add to my cosmetics bag\u2014and they\u2019re not all the usual suspects.\n\nOK, maybe this one is: But after one cappuccino, two cups of tea, half a brisket sandwich and a bag of potato chips, two-and-a half glasses of sparkling ros\u00e9, shrimp cocktail and french fries (my questionable diet being a post for another day), read my lips:\n\n\n\nStunna Lip Paint is the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the snub-nosed, felt-tipped applicator (which gives coverage and precision) to the perfect true-blue red of this inaugural shade, this highly pigmented lip color gives new meaning to \u201clongwear.\u201d And while it dries perfectly matte, it took a smooth seven hours before my lips actually felt dry, which was quickly remedied by a swipe of balm. Even then, the color stayed true. In fact, most of the day, I forgot I had it on ... until someone complimented me on my lipstick.\n\nI love the look of bronzed, luminous skin\u2014even if I have to fake it. After my foundation and brows, the next thing I apply is a few swipes of a Match Stix Shimmer Stick. My daily go-to is Rum, which gives me a subtle sheen (and also makes a great eye shadow), but my new fave is Blonde, which really goes for the gold (without the canary yellow of Trophy Wife). I love that these sticks aren\u2019t over-creamy; they go on like a powder and stay all day. Plus, like much of the line, the packaging is magnetic, which makes them easier to keep track of, travel with and store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus shade: Ridiiic. I love to swirl my blush brush over this shade and onto the apples of my cheeks to create a fresh and sexy coral flush that\u2019s just ... ridic.\n\nIronically, the Invisimatte Blotting Powder was a dark horse for me, despite being a seemingly white powder. But this superfine formula is truly colorless and does a fantastic job of blotting down my more emollient foundations (since I actually find Fenty too flat for me). The accompanying puff is fairly basic, but I prefer to use it with my own brush. Which brings me to my absolute favorite item in this entire collection ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLadies, back away from the beauty blenders (though Fenty\u2019s got those, too); y\u2019all are sleeping on Fenty\u2019s foundation brush. This brush is hands-down the best I\u2019ve ever used to apply foundation\u2014and I\u2019ve been using foundation brushes for decades. Unlike blenders, which are great to use damp, but often absorb as much product as they deposit, this domed, densely packed brush gave me a truly flawless finish\u2014no matter what foundation I paired it with.\n\nAnd aside from its utility, it\u2019s beautiful, and being a woman-on-the-go like myself, Rihanna truly thought of everything, including a brush protector that makes it easy to toss in a bag without mess or damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there you have it: the Fenty finds I\u2019m holding on to for dear life.

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated. Even though Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan has repeatedly warned me never to trust men with bangs, if I saw these motherfuckers in line at Target, I\u2019d call the 911 immediately.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in racial profiling, but if the operator asked me what was wrong, I\u2019d tell him or her: \u201cLook, I know these white people have someone chained up at the crib. I can just feel it!\u201d\n\nBut back to the fascinating plot of Taken 2: Wypipo Boogaloo.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a 17-year-old daughter of the Turpins escaped from her shackles, slipped out of a window and dialed 911 on a cellphone that had been deactivated. When she met authorities, she showed them pictures of her brothers and sisters who were being held captive by her parents, according to the Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Department looked at the girl\u2019s cellphone photos and decided to perform a welfare check on the home. When officers arrived at the Perris, Calif., home, they discovered 12 of the girl\u2019s siblings all chained to beds throughout the house.\n\nAt first the cops thought they had found a bunch of mistreated children, but it turns out that most of the captive Turpin siblings (ranging in age from 2 to 29) were adults and were so egregiously malnourished that cops assumed that they were kids. In fact, the officers initially estimated that the 17-year-old who escaped was only 10 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could actually write most of this article with my eyes closed because, before I was assigned this story, I was up in the wee hours of the morning reading about it. Besides being fascinated by the shenanigans of weird Caucasians, my thirst for understanding has always revolved around one central question:\n\n\n\nWhy are white people like this?\n\nI don\u2019t ask that question rhetorically or with an attempt at humor. I have a serious need to know. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning investigating this story with no expectation of ever writing about it. I wanted to know for myself, but now that the editorial team at The Root has involved you in my search for answers, here\u2019s what I found at the bottom of the rabbit hole I descended into:\n\nThe Turpins have 13 children and have been married for more than 30 years; they renewed their vows in 2015, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from their affinity for bangs and Wrangler jeans, they are deeply religious and adhered to the principles of the small-but-growing Christian sect called \u201cQuiverFull.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat the hell is QuiverFull?\u201d (I have a very good internet connection.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you can make a QuiverFull souffl\u00e9 all by yourself! All you have to do is take the \u201calt-right,\u201d white supremacist belief of the white genocide movement, sprinkle in a little Christian fundamentalism and\u2014voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment.

The new beauty mogul, who rocked the cosmetics industry this past September with her full-spectrum beauty launch, responded kindly and clearly on why even the question was problematic:\n\n\n\nSad, indeed. In two decades of acting and modeling\u2014plus-sized modeling, to be specific\u2014I\u2019ve definitely experienced my share of tokenism (as has our supermodel editor, Veronica Webb). Sometimes it\u2019s being cast as the cute-but-not-at-all-threatening sidekick/accessory; more often, it\u2019s as the sole black girl in major campaigns. It seems that there\u2019s rarely ever room for more than one, a fact Rihanna references here. It\u2019s reductive and ultimately divisive when you think about how many beautiful, talented and worthy black women there are in the game.\n\nWhat Rihanna touches upon here is the nuance of a politically correct practice that is simultaneously necessary and dehumanizing. Brands need diversity to show that they\u2019re inclusive, but it\u2019s rarely a moral decision; it\u2019s usually an economic one. But with black women holding down 22 percent of the American beauty market, we not only deserve better, we deserve more. We deserve to be viewed as more than quotas. We\u2019re human, like everyone else, and we like to be pretty, too.\n\nObviously, the same is true of trans women\u2014not to mention the multitudes of black trans women. Here at The Glow Up, we respect and hope to represent all iterations of black womanhood, so trans representation is important to us. But what we\u2019re not going to do is strategically tokenize our trans sisters. Diversity of expression in womanhood should be organic\u2014and, above all else, human. When and where we enter should be at our own pace and comfort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to another important point that Rihanna touches on here: privacy. In my discussion with Veronica about this issue, she recounted working with all types of trans models during her storied career, most memorably, Teri Toye. The truth is, the fashion industry had a \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy as deep (yet, not as damaging) as the military\u2019s. Fashion has long been a space where all gender and sexuality types\u2014if not body types\u2014could peacefully coexist and thrive at whatever level of exposure they felt comfortable with. We\u2019re thrilled to see it expanding to openly acknowledge all types of identities, and consider the space we\u2019re creating no different.\n\nBut what we love most about how Rihanna used her celebrity privilege and black female perspective to enlighten this fan is her rejection of the notion that anybody\u2014that is, any body\u2014should be used as a marketing tool.

While many outlets mistakenly reported the numbers as earnings, earned media value is actually the estimated value of publicity a brand gains through digital or social media.\n\nBrands pay for advertising every single day. That advertising can cost a lot of money. EMV shows us how much a company gets and what it would have cost had the company actually paid for the advertising. When a brand\u2019s products get talked about, shared, tweeted and written about in magazines, on social media, that is basically free advertising for them.\n\nEMV measures how much that advertising would have cost if the brand had paid for it. It is not an indication of the brand\u2019s actual earnings. However, earned media value can and does turn into real revenue for a company. It is a measurement of social capital.\n\nThink of it the way you think of tweet impressions. Press the Twitter Analytics button on any one of your tweets. The impressions number is how many eyeballs saw your tweet. That plays into EMV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow think of tweet engagement as sales. Someone seeing your tweet is an impression. That\u2019s eyeballs on a product. Someone engaging with your tweet? That\u2019s a sale. This is how EMV works.\n\nIn other words, if eyeballs on the tweet, post, etc., lead to people clicking and going through to buy a product, that is EMV.\n\nIn the case of Fenty Beauty, when the company launched on Sept. 8, the internet went wild. Women tweeted, took Instagram pictures and made Facebook posts showing their hauls and their face-beats using the highly coveted products. That is advertising gold. Fenty didn\u2019t have to do anything but be great; social media fans did all the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only companies to do better than Fenty Beauty during the month of September were Anastasia Beverly Hills and legacy cosmetics brand MAC. Rihanna\u2019s company even beat out brands like Urban Decay and Kylie Cosmetics.\n\nThis is a very specific example of the power that black people, and specifically black women, have on social media. Our voices and our dollars matter and make a huge difference.\n\nThese other companies would do well to pay attention. Black Twitter holds a lot of social capital. Black people have a lot of dollars, and we are willing to spend them on the right products and companies. We will also uplift the products and companies we like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe success of Fenty Beauty in its first month was largely driven by social media. We won\u2019t know what the company actually earned in dollars until January, but if the earned media value is any indication, the company is already on the right track to make a mint.", "keywords": ["brands", "driven", "beauty", "voices", "advertising", "value", "social", "black", "beautys", "products", "fenty", "earned", "media", "company", "capital"], "polarity": 0.14524891774891774, "subjectivity": 0.3378814935064936},

These companies are tasked with placing borrowers in affordable repayment plans and preventing them from defaulting on their loans.\n\nAmid consumer complaints over poor communication, mismanaged paperwork and payment-processing delays, the Obama administration included some contract requirements intended to improve the quality of loan servicing, but companies complained that the requirements would be expensive and unnecessarily time-consuming.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a letter addressed to James W. Runcie, head of the Federal Student Aid office at the Education Department, DeVos said: \u201cThis process has been subjected to a myriad of moving deadlines, changing requirements and a lack of consistent objectives. We must promptly address not only these shortcomings but also any other issues that may impede our ability to ensure borrowers do not experience deficiencies in service. This must be done with precision, timeliness and transparency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Post, DeVos withdrew three memos issued by former Education Secretary John King and his undersecretary Ted Mitchell, including one that called for companies to be held accountable for providing borrowers with accurate, consistent and timely information about their debt.\n\nFrom the Washington Post concerning those Obama-era memos:\n\nThe 56-page memo [pdf] called for the creation of financial incentives for targeted outreach to people at great risk of defaulting on their loans, a baseline level of service for all borrowers and a contract flexible enough to penalize servicers for poor service, among other things. The Obama administration requested routine audits of records, systems, complaints and a compliance-review process. It also directed Runcie\u2019s team to base compensation on response time to answering calls, completing applications for income-driven repayment plans, errors made during communications and the amount of time it takes to process payments. Another memo insisted [pdf] FSA consider a company\u2019s past performance in divvying up the student loan portfolio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexis Goldstein, senior policy at Americans for Financial Reform, told the Post, \u201cIn order to have accountability, there must be real consequences when servicers violate the law. DeVos\u2019 actions today moves us away from true accountability, and creates dangers for the very student loan borrowers the department is responsible for protecting.\u201d\n\nThat particular list of demands came as a result of an outpouring of complaints to both the Education Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the practices of some loan servicers.\n\nMore from the Washington Post:\n\nThe CFPB, in particular, has documented instances of servicing companies providing inconsistent information, misplacing paperwork or charging unexpected fees. Because the federal government pays hundreds of millions of dollars to companies such as Navient, Great Lakes and American Education Services to manage $1.2 trillion in student loans, advocacy groups and lawmakers argue that more should be required of these contractors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, the CFPB filed a federal lawsuit earlier this year alleging that Navient, the nation\u2019s largest servicer of student loans, has misled borrowers for years with respect to its policies and practices, costing them millions of dollars.\n\nThe company formerly known as Sallie Mae is the largest servicer of student loans in the United States. It services the loans of 12 million borrowers, including 6 million under a contract with the U.S. Department of Education, and handles more than $300 billion in federal and private student loans.\n\nAccording to the suit, Navient and its preferred collector, Pioneer Credit Recovery, engaged in \u201cunlawful acts and practices in connection with defendants\u2019 servicing and collection of student loans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe suit alleges that Navient has failed at its core duties by deterring borrowers from obtaining access to long-term, affordable repayment plans and misleading them on how forbearance can be more costly to them in the end. It says that Navient buried a lot of useful information for borrowers in small print and, in other instances, hid information altogether that might have helped borrowers make better decisions about their repayment plans.\n\nMore from the Washington Post:\n\nNavient chief executive Jack Remondi, in an interview with the Washington Post earlier this year, said the government has too many inconsistencies in regulations and standards governing servicing companies. His company is battling multiple lawsuits that accuse Navient of steering people into costly payment options, rather than take the time to offer the best solutions\u2014charges that Remondi vehemently denies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos said in her letter Tuesday that the new contract would provide an opportunity to improve borrower outcomes and demonstrate \u201csound fiscal stewardship\u201d of taxpayers dollars.\n\nOf course, all of this comes at a time when the Department of Education is facing $9 billion in proposed budget cuts. The Post reports that the Trump administration is redirecting money away from higher education programs and into its school choice agenda.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["borrowers", "consumer", "huge", "secretary", "post", "department", "navient", "protections", "loan", "companies", "student", "washington", "loans", "devos", "removed", "education"], "polarity": 0.09891774891774892, "subjectivity": 0.4142992424242425},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

Most importantly, an organization\u2019s activities must be embodied in its mission.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost notes that \u201cHUD is not the only federal agency changing its mission under President Donald Trump. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director recently informed employees that it was removing the phrase \u2018America\u2019s promise as a nation of immigrants\u2019 from its mission statement.\u201d Because that mission is in direct conflict with Trump\u2019s mission to \u201cmake America white.\u201d\n\n\n\nCarson has served his role as the lone black face in the Trump administration well; he barely talks above an audible level, which covers the \u201cBe seen and not heard\u201d clause in his contract, but at this point he\u2019s actually starting to tear into policy put in place by people much smarter than he is, so it would be nice if he could just go back to working on brains and leave the high-level stuff to smarter folks.", "keywords": ["oz", "carson", "mission", "housing", "ben", "hud", "hes", "statement", "secretary", "ask", "brain", "needs", "quality", "communities", "wizard", "mumbles", "operate"], "polarity": 0.08255624426078971, "subjectivity": 0.39129017447199266},

She lifts the shirt over her head to reveal a white woman in a cream-colored shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ad hit a sore spot for black people.

Betsy DeVos just did that. Nothing about this woman screams \u201clet her lead the children to the promised land\u201d but yet and still here we are. And since she\u2019s here, she\u2019s like, \u201chey, fuck it, let\u2019s go ahead and rewrite history and talk about HBCUs, you know, since we have an extra 13 minutes\u2026yo, dictator\u2026dictate this\u2026\u201d\n\nFrom the Department of Education website:\n\n\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos released the following statement after meeting with presidents and chancellors of Historically Black Colleges and Universities at the White House: A key priority for this administration is to help develop opportunities for communities that are often the most underserved. Rather than focus solely on funding, we must be willing to make the tangible, structural reforms that will allow students to reach their full potential. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have done this since their founding. They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education. They saw that the system wasn't working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. Their counsel and guidance will be crucial in addressing the current inequities we face in education. I look forward to working with the White House to elevate the role of HBCUs in this administration and to solve the problems we face in education today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, for fuck\u2019s sake.\n\nI don\u2019t even know where to start. Even by Trumpian standards, this is some next level shit. To discuss the founding and inception of HBCU\u2019s without mentioning segregation\u2026I mean, I\u2019m speechless. It\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this; I literally can\u2019t speak. To imply that HBCUs started because a bunch of Black students were basically waiting on schools to take them off the waitlist is fucking unconscionable. And I\u2019ve never used that word before. I\u2019ve never been in a position to use it before. So black students were all chillin, refreshing their computers for acceptance letters all the live long day, and somebody was like\u2026yo\u2026let\u2019s just start our own schools. There\u2019s too many of us and not enough schools to educate us, equally, silly. It had noooooothing to do with the fact that white schools really weren\u2019t fucking with The Blacks like that at all. For like, for real. Nope.\n\nBruh.\n\nSchool choice? Really? School choice implies OPTIONS. HBCUs weren\u2019t filled with a bunch of students who made the choice we can make today of Harvard versus Howard. Nawl. My God what an irresponsible statement. Pioneers? They were pioneers in education for Blacks, but in school choice????? We ain\u2019t have any options, b. It was pretty much read and die. Education? Folks died for less. Black schools were borne out of necessity and included (largely) white folks who had money and probably felt like, sure, give them their own schools, THAT WAY we don\u2019t all have to go to school together. They decided that while a white education was probably not in the cards, educating Black students might not be so bad, too. So, many HBCUs grew out of this desire to keep shit \u201cseparate, but equal\u201d though that term wouldn\u2019t even exist formally until well after many HBCUs were established. And even then, that doctrine is rooted in racism because equality means equal access to resources, and we all know access to resources has never been high on America\u2019s list of priorities for minorities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how is that even choice as its being described, anyway? Comparing HBCUs to the current school choice political environment is about as idiotic as one can get. The CURRENT battle is rooted in what provision of an entitlement to K-12 education looks like. Meanwhile, back in slavery days and even AFTER the Civil War, it was you either don\u2019t go to college or you go to an HBCU. Sure, some Black people managed to attend and graduate from some of the upper echelon schools. But if you\u2019ll recall from the Book of The South, large scale integration in the public sphere only happened, by law/force, in the 1950s. There are reasons why we know the names of individuals who attempted to integrate PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES, like James Meredith. That\u2019s not exercising options, it\u2019s availing yourself of the only option you have. We\u2019re comparing apples and Black power fists, here. HOW IT HAPPEN? WHY IT HAPPEN?\n\nI\u2019m actually dumbfounded that she\u2019s using HBCU\u2019s as a justification for school choice in America\u2019s public K-12 education. Dumb. Founded.\n\nI have to give a handclap to Mrs. DeVos for teaching us not to underestimate the shear insanity of white folks who are out here whitefolkin\u2019. Also, you know for a FACT that there were no Black people involved in the creation of that press release because even the MOST conservative Black cat on the planet would have to raise a flag on that statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope.", "keywords": ["know", "white", "idiot", "fucking", "options", "school", "hbcus", "black", "betsy", "students", "schools", "choice", "education", "devos", "pioneers"], "polarity": 0.043958633958633975, "subjectivity": 0.46122036057221244},

He\u2019s worse than a mess; he\u2019s a mess wrapped inside an atrocity that has been dipped in mild scandal sauce.\n\n\n\nSince taking the job, Mumbles Carson has basically wandered around the HUD building trying to figure out which office is his. In an attempt to help him with this, Mumbles\u2019 wife decided that she would blow some $31,000 of HUD money on a dining set.

And realized way too late that Ryan is really not the one.\n\nNormally, in the black community, I feel we have a good idea of people not to test. We don\u2019t test our grandmothers, we usually don\u2019t test that one auntie who will ruthlessly clap back, etc.\n\nAlas, Patton, a black conservative and an event planner who somehow landed a job in the Trump administration at HUD without any prior housing experience, apparently doesn\u2019t have that sense of self-preservation and decided to come for Ryan, who is really that auntie.\n\nIt all started when Patton, who heads a regional HUD office overseeing New York and New Jersey, decided that it was a good idea to call Ryan \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d during a Twitter argument.\n\nThe now deleted tweet also had the hashtag #BankruptBlogger.\n\nApparently, according to the New York Daily News, the spat started when Ryan appeared on CNN and spoke about how she and other reporters have received death threats as a result of the president\u2019s attacks on the press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatton, who planned Eric Trump\u2019s wedding before she was appointed to HUD, took to Twitter to brush aside Ryan\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cAs a conservative black female who has publicly worked for & supported @realDonaldTrump, I\u2019ve been getting death threats from fellow minorities on the left for the past 3 years \u2014 so welcome to the club. @AprilDRyan,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe two continued to go back and forth before Patton fired the final shot: \u201cI hear #MissPiggys still on a rampage. Gee, I must\u2019ve struck a nerve, @AprilDRyan! #BankruptBlogger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout an hour later, Patton came to her senses, tweeting out an apology.\n\n\u201cI deleted my last tweet by choice. No one from this Administration contacted me. It was beneath me & I apologize to @AprilDRyan,\u201d she wrote in the tweet. \u201cMy parents raised me to respect others & I regret my response. I apologize to them, @SecretaryCarson & the Trump family. They deserved better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe apology came a little too late, though. Because, remember, Ryan is really not the one you should try. This is the same reporter who has fearlessly stood her ground amid the disrespect she has faced while reporting on the Trump administration. This is the same reporter who casually asked Donald Trump \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event at the White House.\n\nSo naturally, Ryan responded with a swift and expert level of clapback-ery that had me clutching at my pearls and probably made Queen Rihanna of Clapbacks proud.\n\nFirst, because Ryan is a classy reporter, she of course had to fact-check Patton. She basically pulled a #FakeNews on a Trump official, and I\u2019m here for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, when you\u2019re an event planner suddenly turned housing official, there are some receipts that have to be read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, leaving no stone unturned, as a proper reporter should, especially in a dragging, Ryan hit her with the \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d while seamlessly @ing Omarosa Manigault Newman, who has been accused of threatening Ryan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, with a Mariah Carey level of shade, she wrapped it all up with a smooth, \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nBut seriously, all drama aside, it is unthinkable that an official representing a presidential administration would conduct herself that way. Then again, everything is unprecedented and game in this administration, it seems, so perhaps it\u2019s not that surprising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, political pundit Armstrong Williams tweeted out to Ryan that he had spoken to HUD Secretary Ben Carson, a longtime friend, who had attempted to reach out to Ryan on Thursday morning to apologize.\n\nRyan missed the call but is sure to follow up because, again\u2014and hopefully for the last time so these people can know\u2014April Ryan is NOT the one.", "keywords": ["late", "tries", "reporter", "housing", "official", "ryan", "hud", "administration", "piggy", "patton", "calling", "apologize", "miss", "really", "trump", "test", "realizes"], "polarity": 0.03126306165099268, "subjectivity": 0.4200148032044584},

There are the celebrities who initially grabbed headlines, like actress Ashley Judd, who was the first to go on the record to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. But there is also a hospital worker, an engineer, a strawberry picker, a housekeeper, an entrepreneur\u2014all of whom had their portraits taken for the piece.\n\nWhile prominent public figures like Judd and Terry Crews drove the conversation about sexual harassment and sexual assault to the forefront, the article is arguably most effective in showing the scope of a pervasive, global problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time writes:\n\nThe women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City\u2019s regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They\u2019re part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.\n\nTime magazine says its team spent six weeks compiling stories of harassment and assault, interviewing dozens of men and women in a windowless room in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. Following Time\u2019s announcement of the Person of the Year, Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent for the outlet, noted on Twitter that the piece was \u201cconceived, reported and written by women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was fact-checked by women,\u201d Alter added. \u201cThe video was shot and edited by women. The layout and photo spread were designed by women.\u201d\n\nA conspicuous absence on Time magazine\u2019s front cover, though, is that of Tarana Burke, who originally used the phrase \u201cme too\u201d to build solidarity among survivors of sexual abuse more than a decade ago. Burke is featured in both the promotional video for the story and within the article itself.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment does bring shame,\u201d Burke told the magazine. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTime does note that people of color\u2014as well as immigrants, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people\u2014face \u201cmany types of dread\u201d when they come forward to report sexual abuse.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they raised their voices, would they be fired?\u201d the article notes. \u201cWould their communities turn against them? Would they be killed?\u201d\n\nAmong the people of color whose experiences are profiled are Crystal Washington, one of seven employees of the Plaza Hotel who have filed a sexual harassment suit against the hotel; and Adama Iwu, a lobbyist who organized an open letter exposing harassment in the California Legislature. Terry Crews, the most recognizable man to come forward with sexual harassment claims, is also shown prominently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody questions the predator,\u201d Crews told Time. \u201cYou know why?

Anita Hill is rightfully mentioned as a predecessor to the #MeToo movement who did not receive the same groundswell of public support. And among the most conspicuous celebrity absences may be that of actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who is among the dozens of women who came forward with stories of Weinstein\u2019s predatory and harassing behavior toward them\u2014and the only one whose story he specifically disputed.\n\nAnd it turns out, Donald Trump, who claimed he would \u201cprobably\u201d have been Time person of the year, did get a mention\u2014as the sexual harasser in chief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, cited the president as a reason she decided to blow the whistle on her former employer.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\u201d Fowler told Time. \u201cI felt like I had to take action.\u201d\n\nRead more at Time.", "keywords": ["breakers", "women", "come", "forward", "men", "names", "person", "movement", "told", "harassment", "silence", "sexual", "magazine", "article"], "polarity": 0.20022434163059163, "subjectivity": 0.4746978715728715},

You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they\u2019ll be right back up there,\u201dthe Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cAnd you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nCarson is a retired neurosurgeon who ran for president in 2016, and before entering into politics, he was a motivational speaker. He regularly discussed the fact that he grew up in poverty, and Lifetime found his life story so compelling, the network turned it into the TV movie Gifted Hands, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. While the biopic set him up to be an inspiration to poor kids everywhere, his conservative politics, constant denunciations of government assistance and the way his foot is always in his mouth have made most people give him an extreme side eye.\n\nCarson\u2019s comments were made during a town hall recorded Tuesday to air in full Wednesday night, and clips of the interview were released to news organizations to promote the show, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson said \u201cthe wrong mindset\u201d is the product of negative parenting habits and exposure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a poverty spirit. You develop a certain mindset,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Carson said he believes the government can help people looking to climb out of poverty, he warned against programs that are \u201csustaining them in a position of poverty. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the majority of people don\u2019t have that defeatist attitude, but they sometimes just don\u2019t see the way, and that\u2019s where government can come in and be very helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can provide the ladder of opportunity, it can provide the mechanism that will demonstrate to them what can be done.\u201d\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget blueprint, unveiled Tuesday, would cut more than $6 billion from HUD\u2019s budget. The cuts would end popular grants that facilitate first-time home ownership and revitalize economically distressed communities, including the Community Development Block Grant. The budget would also cut billions of dollars in funding for public housing support, gutting dollars used to fund big-ticket repairs at public housing developments around the country. Carson has spoken at length in the past about personal responsibility and its intersection with poverty, bemoaning systemic dependence on public assistance. On the campaign trail, Carson repeatedly pushed back against accusations that he wanted to end social safety net programs; he stressed, instead, that he believed government assistance was not always given to people who truly needed it. \u201cI have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people,\u201d he said in the 2015 speech announcing his candidacy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not doing people a favor when we pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, you poor little thing, we\u2019re going to take care of all your needs. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u2019 You know who else says stuff like that? Socialists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment, but Williams did, and in an interview with the Post Wednesday evening, he defended Carson and said his views are based not on politics but on what is just.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of faith, not a man of politics,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDr. Carson believes in what is righteous, what is good, what is fair and what is just.\u201c\n\nSo remember, kids, poverty is just a state of mind. When Sallie Mae/Navient calls you to collect on those student loans next month, tell them that you don\u2019t owe them, and your monthly payment being late is just a state of mind. Remind them that if they keep this mindset, it\u2019s going to feel as if everyone owes them money when they really don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["state", "carson", "ben", "parents", "passed", "thinks", "children", "mindset", "post", "dont", "politics", "way", "poverty", "mind", "williams"], "polarity": 0.09328165374677003, "subjectivity": 0.4390166680864355},

He\u2019s worse than a mess; he\u2019s a mess wrapped inside an atrocity that has been dipped in mild scandal sauce.\n\n\n\nSince taking the job, Mumbles Carson has basically wandered around the HUD building trying to figure out which office is his. In an attempt to help him with this, Mumbles\u2019 wife decided that she would blow some $31,000 of HUD money on a dining set.

Carson added that his family was forced to move from Detroit to Boston because they had \"no place to live.\"\n\nAs such, Carson assured the committee that he understands issues facing the millions of people dependent on HUD programs. Carson also included four letters from past HUD secretaries supporting his confirmation, CNN reports.\n\nSen.

This is the same reporter who casually asked Donald Trump \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event at the White House.\n\nSo naturally, Ryan responded with a swift and expert level of clapback-ery that had me clutching at my pearls and probably made Queen Rihanna of Clapbacks proud.\n\nFirst, because Ryan is a classy reporter, she of course had to fact-check Patton. She basically pulled a #FakeNews on a Trump official, and I\u2019m here for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, when you\u2019re an event planner suddenly turned housing official, there are some receipts that have to be read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, leaving no stone unturned, as a proper reporter should, especially in a dragging, Ryan hit her with the \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d while seamlessly @ing Omarosa Manigault Newman, who has been accused of threatening Ryan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, with a Mariah Carey level of shade, she wrapped it all up with a smooth, \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nBut seriously, all drama aside, it is unthinkable that an official representing a presidential administration would conduct herself that way.

Weinstein had not only donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party but had also hosted fundraisers that the Obamas attended. But the allegations hit particularly close to home for the Obamas because Malia had just wrapped up a coveted internship with the mogul\u2019s production company a few months ago.\n\nFrom CBS News:\n\nMichelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture \u2014 including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect \u2014 so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\n\nMalia landed her internship with the Weinstein Co. earlier this year, working with the production and development department. Many have speculated about what the 19-year-old may have known about the Hollywood producer\u2019s alleged predatory behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie joined the growing list of women who claim that Weinstein harassed or abused them.\n\nOne of the stronger condemnations of Hollywood\u2019s treatment of women came from Black Panther director Ryan Coogler. The director\u2019s debut, Fruitvale Station, about the death of Oscar Grant at the hands of a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer in 2009, was released by the Weinstein Co.\n\nShadow and Act released Coogler\u2019s statement in full. The acclaimed filmmaker said he was \u201cdisturbed and saddened\u201d by the news, adding that he was unaware of Weinstein\u2019s behavior but felt a responsibility to speak on the issue because of his connection to the producer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Coogler didn\u2019t stop there:\n\nI love working as a storyteller. But I work in an industry that too many times has proven to not be a safe space for women. I make it a priority to ensure that there is gender equity and an inclusive work environment on every project I am involved with. However, just minding our business sometimes isn\u2019t enough. It goes without saying, but I will state it now: sexual harassment is a human rights violation, sexual assault is a human rights violation, rape is a human rights violation. The entertainment industry, like many others, has a historic imbalance of power among gender that allows these violations to run rampant. As men we sit in positions of privilege. It is our responsibility to leverage our position, and be allies to the women in our industry. We need to do everything we can to make sure violations like these don\u2019t continue to happen. The first step is to listen. Salute to the brave women who came forward. I could never imagine how difficult that must be.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Coogler has been walking the talk on gender inclusivity in Hollywood, unlike some of the actors and directors who have given lukewarm expressions of shock at the Weinstein allegations.\n\nThe scandal, long regarded as an \u201copen secret\u201d in Hollywood, according to some reports, has forced the entertainment industry to confront the ways it enables and reinforces systems of abuse and exploitation. The Weinstein story in particular has prompted many big names to come out about harassment they\u2019ve suffered. On Tuesday, former NFL player and comedic actor Terry Crews opened up about being groped at a party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHollywood is not the only business [where] this happens,\u201d Crews warned. \u201cAnd to the casualties of this behavior\u2014you are not alone.\u201d\n\nRead more at CBS News.", "keywords": ["released", "obamas", "women", "violation", "hollywood", "industry", "harvey", "rights", "say", "weinstein", "sexual", "human"], "polarity": 0.07222222222222222, "subjectivity": 0.46475308641975305},

Already, the massive storm\u2014the largest ever recorded in the Atlantic\u2014is pummeling every island in the Caribbean that comes across its path. It is unclear just how much devastation it will bring, but forecasters and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have offered scenarios nothing short of terrifying.\n\nThis hurricane season has shown itself to be quite the nightmare, but one\u2019s fears only heighten after considering this nugget that makes this scenario all the more spine-chilling: Ben Carson is in charge of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDr. Ben Carson, the brain surgeon who sounded like a damn fool throughout the entire Republican presidential primary season. To his credit, he sounded like a damn fool before the primary, given that he would do things like compare Obamacare to slavery, along with other random acts of asininity. Ben Carson, who often just stands there for decoration\u2014probably because he was a neurosurgeon and self-help-book writer who somehow became the head of a federal agency despite having no experience in government, much less housing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in March, Carson gave his first speech to his new department and made HUD employees take a \u201cniceness pledge,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nDuring that same speech, he also said this, according to New York magazine:\n\n\u201cEvery human being, regardless of their ethnicities, or their background, they have a brain: the human brain. It remembers everything you\u2019ve ever seen, everything you\u2019ve ever heard. I could take the oldest person here, make a little hole right here on the side of the head, and put some depth electrodes into their hippocampus\u2014and stimulate\u2014and they would be able to read back to you, verbatim, a book they read 60 years ago.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t overload the human brain,\u201d Carson explained. \u201cSo we need to focus a little less on what we can\u2019t do and a little more on what we can do. After all, this is America, the \u2018can-do society\u2019 \u2014 not the, \u2018what can you do for me\u2019 society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson\u2019s first speech was to ask employees to take a niceness pledge while arguing against government handouts. This nitwit didn\u2019t even pass his own pledge of kindness.\n\nA month later, Politico reported:\n\nCarson told Politico that policy proposals are in the works, but in public appearances the one-time presidential candidate is sticking to his stump-speech staples. He prescribes \u201cgodly principles\u201d as a cure for the country\u2019s political division and praises housing advocates for \u201cputting God\u2019s love into action.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of God, which I love to do; quite frankly, he\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Carson said on March 28, drawing friendly laughter during a speech to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. \u201cWe should be grateful that God gave us variety. But you know what he didn\u2018t give us variety in? The brain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe month after that, NPR reported:\n\nOn Wednesday night, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson \u2014 whose budget to help low-income households would be cut by more than $6 billion next year \u2014 added his own thoughts. He said in a radio interview that \u201cpoverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.\u201d Carson \u2014 who himself grew up in poverty to become a widely acclaimed neurosurgeon \u2014 said people with the \u201cright mind set\u201d can have everything taken away from them, and they\u2019ll pull themselves up. He believes the converse is true as well. \u201cYou take somebody with the wrong mind-set, you can give them everything in the world [and] they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson tried to clarify his comments, but, spoiler, he repeated the same sentiment with phrasing that was the Tia to its original statement\u2019s Tamera. Not even Tahj or Tavior Mowry, but Tamera.\n\n\n\nOn the Monday following Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall and the historic rainfall it quickly brought to Texas, Secretary Carson released a statement assuring that HUD would be there for victims in need.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] begins to assess the damage and respond to the immediate needs of residents, HUD will be there to offer assistance and support the longer-term housing recovery efforts,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat followed was a bulleted list of HUD\u2019s efforts, but one wonders, can Carson get any of it done? This question is spurred not only by Carson\u2019s own past remarks but also by a new report outlining just how poorly run HUD is under Carson\u2019s leadership.\n\nDays before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, ProPublica published \u201cIs Anybody Home at HUD?,\u201d which highlighted the decimation of a vital federal agency under Carson.\n\nProPublica\u2019s Alec MacGillis noted that now-former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon called for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d back in February. The administration\u2019s initial budget called for deep cuts to HUD\u2014cuts the Washington Post\u2019s Lisa Rein highlights \u201cwould slice away funding for long-term preparedness efforts, many of them put in place to address the sluggish federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. 45 picked the perfect person to run an agency for which he and those around him have great disdain.\n\nAs MacGillis reports, the plan is going exactly as it is designed:\n\nAs I watched the hearings, it occurred to me that Carson was the perfect HUD secretary for Donald Trump, the real-estate-developer president who appears to care little for public housing. He offered a gently smiling refutation to accusations from any corner that the department\u2019s evisceration would have grave consequences. After all, Ben Carson had made it from Detroit to Johns Hopkins without housing assistance, a point of pride in his family. Not to mention that Carson\u2019s very identity \u2014 theoretically \u2014 helped inoculate the administration against charges of prejudice. (Just last week, Carson said, in the wake of racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, that the controversy over Trump\u2019s support of white supremacists there was \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d and echoed the president\u2019s \u201cboth sides\u201d language when referring to \u201chatred and bigotry.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd like 45, Carson keeps family around where they don\u2019t belong:\n\nThen there was the mystery of why Carson\u2019s family was taking such a visible role in the department. There was the omnipresent Mrs. Carson. Even more striking, however, had been the active role of the secretary\u2019s second-oldest son. Ben Carson Jr., who goes by B.J. and co-founded an investment firm in Columbia, Maryland, that specializes in infrastructure, health care and workforce development, was showing up on email chains within the department and appearing often at headquarters. One day, he was seen leaving the 10th-floor office of David Eagles, the new COO, who was crafting a HUD reorganization to accompany the cuts.\n\nAn anonymous source told ProPublica of Carson: \u201cPeople feel disrespected. They see Carson and think, I\u2019ve been in housing policy for 20 or 30 years, and if I walked away, I would never expect to get hired as a nurse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Carson is a religious zealot who makes the mistake of personalizing poverty in a way that is detrimental to those who know that for every rarity that is Ben Carson, there are many others who continue to languish in a system designed to keep them stuck where they are.\n\nIn reality, more often than not, people have to be given opportunities to get out of poverty. They need adequate housing, they need support and they need a helping hand. Even if Carson is a brain surgeon who doubles as a village idiot, one would think even he would understand that the difference between him and the man who gave him a job for which he is unqualified had everything handed to him\u2014which promised him a much more certain fate than Carson had as a child.\n\n\n\nIt was already worrisome that a man who thinks poverty is a state of mind was in charge of an organization designed to help the poorest among us. It\u2019s even worse now that the poorest of Houston have been affected by a natural disaster, only to seek refuge in an organization that lacks staffing, resources and competency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHUD is supposed to rebuild homes, parks, hospitals and community centers. Carson behaves as if he couldn\u2019t build a paper plane at his office in their building. How petrified should most of them be?\n\nIn response to the story, Carson said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 Special Report: \u201cI would say that you should ring the doorbell before you conclude that nobody\u2019s at home. I don\u2019t think they did a very good job at journalistic investigation there.\u201d\n\nWell, this is your chance to show and prove, you brain-dead brain surgeon. I don\u2019t have much faith in you, but for the sake of my home state of Texas, Florida and whatever other areas are affected, I\u2019m praying you don\u2019t fuck up.\n\n", "keywords": ["speech", "carson", "housing", "state", "ben", "hud", "brain", "need", "petrified", "head", "poverty", "hurricane", "victims"], "polarity": 0.11839024423136571, "subjectivity": 0.449990424943696},

Scan complete, you then consider turning down your music. And then, after 0.000001 seconds of consideration, you turn down your fucking music because you don\u2019t want them to accuse you of assaulting a cop\u2019s eardrums or some shit and have justification to shoot you.\n\nTurning down the music isn\u2019t enough, though. The cop might roll up to your window right in the middle of one of Rozay\u2019s grunts, and even a low-volume Rozay grunt is enough to scare a cop enough to shoot you.

These songs aren\u2019t necessarily only on your playlists for this reason. You do genuinely like them. They just also happen to be, well, less likely to lead to your death by cop.

Ben, this is Herman. I know you don\u2019t know me, but I thought I\u2019d give you a call because I understand what you are going through. I know what it\u2019s like to be called a house Negro because they call me a house Negro, too, and if being like the rest of these darkies is the only way to get rid of that label, then I\u2019ll be that.\n\nOK, so Herman Cain really didn\u2019t say that, but he basically said that. Recently the Michigan Chronicle, a historically black newspaper from Ben Carson\u2019s hometown of Detroit, referred to Carson as the \u201cshame of Detroit\u201d and said that he was in competition for the \u201cHouse Negro of the Year Award.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain didn\u2019t take too kindly to that, and the former Republican presidential candidate wrote a post on his website blasting the paper for using the term.\n\nHe took it a step further on Wednesday when he wrote another post, titled, \u201cHouse Negroes Stand Up!\u201d in which he laments that he, too, has been referred to as a house Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey say it to me too, Dr. Ben Carson, because just like you, I refuse to embrace the backward thinking of today\u2019s black identity politics,\u201d Cain writes.\n\nHe goes on to say that since the Chronicle thinks Carson is a house Negro, then he, Cain, must be one, too, because that\u2019s \u201cone of the names you get called by other black people when you are a success at something, and you do not buy into \u2018black group think\u2019 or act and say what they want you to say.\u201d\n\nNo, sir, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite how that moniker is earned, but please, continue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain then goes on to criticize the current movement to have Confederate monuments removed, calling it a \u201cwaste of time and distractions,\u201d and saying that the Chronicle may not have noticed the \u201csuccessful black people\u201d in \u201cprominent positions in America\u201d because they mind their business like the good black folk they are, focusing on \u201cperformance and productive opportunities\u201d rather than worrying about the past.\n\nOK.\n\nThen Cain gets all \u201cHe won\u2019t say it, but I will,\u201d like he is really about to read someone or something, and says:\n\nGentle Dr. Ben Carson is too nice to respond to that garbage article and name-calling by the Michigan Chronicle, but I\u2019m not! Let\u2019s start with the fact that he prayed hard about even accepting the HUD job. Personally, I was glad he accepted it, because he will bring \u201coutside the box\u201d ideas and thinking to HUD. Many of the old ways of doing things have left many of our urban areas unchanged for 50 years, and too many of our young people have been trapped in cycles of poverty, crime and weak educations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh? Have we witnessed any of this so-called outside-the-box thinking and ideas? What has Carson brought to the table since joining the Department of Housing and Urban Development?\n\nCain then stresses for us that Carson \u201cdidn\u2019t become a world-renowned brain surgeon by being a \u2018house Negro,\u2019\u201d but I don\u2019t think anyone has made that allegation, so I think this is another instance of you keep using that phrase, but I don\u2019t think you understand what it means, Herman.\n\nHe writes that Carson could have taken any other \u201cbetter paying and less stressful\u201d job in the world, but he chose to \u201cserve his country and a president who is truly trying to create a better America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is where I have to stop you for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Carson is not making some huge sacrifice for other Americans, and most especially not for other black Americans, so let\u2019s just be real about that.\n\nSecond, Donald Trump is not trying to create a better America for anyone who looks like you, you misguided darkie. Like, for real, for real. Get your head out of your ass and wake up. You acting real Stacey Dash right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continues:\n\nThe Michigan Chronicle thanks Dr. Carson for his sacrifice and dedication by calling him a nasty insulting name. It\u2019s the usual attempt to try to discredit his patriotism and to discourage him. Knowing Dr. Carson, that old tactic ain\u2019t going to work.\n\nNo, I\u2019m pretty sure they are just calling him out for behavior that seeks to set him apart from other blacks in the country as if he is somehow better than everyone else. He is uplifting a president that is doing everything in his power to enable the constant and persistent persecution of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain goes on to say that there are plenty of black folks not drinking the \u201cname-calling brand of Kool-Aid,\u201d and we see a hint of his black roots showing themselves for a brief instant. He ruins the moment, though, by reiterating the point that those same black folks are being good and minding their business and not giving Massa no trouble like the rest of us darkies:\n\nBeing called a \u201chouse Negro\u201d is just one of the insulting names I have been called as an ABC (American Black Conservative), simply because I do not subscribe to the black liberal backward-looking narrative of black identity politics. Maybe that\u2019s why I have had multiple successful careers over the last 50 years, and name-calling has not stopped or slowed me down yet! If being called a \u201chouse Negro\u201d is what some of us must endure for succeeding in this nation and thinking for ourselves, then let all of the \u201chouse Negroes\u201d stand up and be counted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLOL. OK. Y\u2019all go on ahead and do that. You got it.\n\nCain ends his note by saying, \u201cWow! There are too many [house Negroes] to count, but there\u2019s Dr. Ben Carson standing tall among millions, and doing something great again.\u201d This does not sound like a compliment that anyone other than someone who is referred to as a house Negro would appreciate, but I digress.\n\nLet\u2019s let Herman Cain and Ben Carson stand together in solidarity, then.\n\nThank you, Herman Cain, for saying about yourself, multiple times in one post, what my editors won\u2019t let me say about you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["note", "carson", "house", "cain", "ben", "think", "negro", "black", "pens", "say", "dr", "odd", "herman", "chronicle"], "polarity": 0.0856729497354497, "subjectivity": 0.43780175264550264},

Several years ago we bought a farm in rural Maryland. One of the neighbors immediately put up a Confederate flag. A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who took down the Confederate flag. More recently our home in Virginia along with that of a neighbor was vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned. In both instances, less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road. We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let\u2019s use the right tools. By the way, that neighbor who put up the Confederate flag subsequently became friendly. That is the likely outcome if we just learn to be neighborly and to get to know each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust think about 1) how terrible this fucking story is and 2) how delusional Narcoleptic Shaft must be to think that it\u2019s inspiring or engaging or uplifting or anything other than proof that this nigga needs to move. His neighbor put up a gotdamn Confederate flag\u2014America\u2019s most unambiguous symbol of hate\u2014and Carson\u2019s response was that you beat racism by throwing American flags at it. This is not a man who needs to be holding public office. Or private office. Or even needs to be in any building that contains an office.

Rettenmaier was convicted of child pornography. Rettenmaier was reported by someone working at the Geek Squad\u2019s Brooks, Ky., facility, where technicians repair computers of Best Buy customers from around the country.\n\nThe EFF sought to know if the informants simply stumbled across the data on the hard drive or if they had been directed and trained to do so. Civil liberties advocates argue that, if the Geek Squad workers are paid by the FBI, then searching computers without a warrant might be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (That\u2019s the one that protects against illegal search and seizure. Don\u2019t worry, Donald Trump didn\u2019t know it, either.)\n\nWhat they found was startling. They discovered that Geek Squad workers, under the knowledge and direction of Best Buy, had been working with federal investigators for at least 10 years as \u201cconfidential human sources,\u201d or CHS, rummaging through the hard drives of people who had not been arrested or convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an unclassified FBI memo (pdf), in September 2008, the FBI held a meeting at the Best Buy Kentucky offices. The document boasted of the company\u2019s cozy relationship with the FBI:\n\nThe Brooks facility repairs and conducts data recovery on thousands of computers every day. The [FBI\u2019s] Louisville Division has maintained close liaison with the Geek Squad\u2019s management in an effort to glean case initiations and to support the division\u2019s Computer Intrusion and Cyber Crime programs.\n\nThe information obtained by the EFF shows the evolution of a detailed process that begins when workers find potentially illegal material on hard drives. The techs relay the information to the FBI, which then investigates the data and sends the information to a field office near the customer\u2019s home for further investigation. However, it was the next step that is most important:\n\nThen the FBI would sometimes obtain a warrant.\n\nEven in cases that were not prosecuted, Best Buy employees would make exact copies of the hard drive on blank drives, CDs and flash drives and forward the borrowed data to the FBI. In most of the cases, the FBI notes made sure to specify that no warrant was obtained prior to the Snitch Squad\u2019s search.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe documents noted that the feds rewarded the Geek Squad techs up to $500 for each time they found incriminating evidence. In at least one case, child pornography was gleaned from unallocated space on the drive. The Geek Squad somehow got the contents of the drive to the FBI despite the fact that, without forensic tools, the Geek Squad couldn\u2019t have known that the material was on the drive; nor did they have any reason to inspect unallocated space.\n\nThe FBI, however, insisted that it did not instruct Best Buy employees to proactively search for information. If you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I\u2019m going to scream, and I need a second to switch to all caps and italics:\n\nTHAT DOES NOT MAKE US FEEL BETTER!\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to breathe a sigh of relief knowing that we could be arrested for something on our hard drives even if the FBI wasn\u2019t investigating us? Seriously, why would you ever mention that part? The fact that Geek Squadders are paid to find any violation means they will search every computer they come across, in hopes of finding something illegal!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you know what people will do for $500? When I was in college, my friends and I drove to a party about an hour away. We didn\u2019t have enough room for everyone, and one of our friends laughingly suggested that he\u2019d ride in the trunk. Five of us chipped in $10 apiece and bet him he wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nHe took the bet.\n\nFor $50.\n\nHaving a squad of paid informants is problematic in that it is possible that the Geek Squad could not only extract information but could ultimately plant information and files on someone\u2019s hard drive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did not release all of the documents, claiming that some were privileged information, so no one knows exactly how many customers\u2019 computers Geek Squad employees rifled through. The FBI also refused to say whether or not this program exists at other Best Buy facilities or at any other private companies.\n\nI\u2019m just happy the Geek Squad doesn\u2019t have a team roving around inspecting car trunks.", "keywords": ["snitching", "information", "squad", "drives", "buy", "best", "drive", "geek", "customers", "fbi", "data", "report", "hard", "dry"], "polarity": 0.12634648370497426, "subjectivity": 0.4492876201366768},

And even after \u201cthe friend\u201d is exposed and is proved to be as authentic as Kim Kardashian\u2019s ass, it doesn\u2019t seem to stop the politician\u2019s advancement; on the contrary, the imagined political friend has just become the way of a real political life.\n\n\n\nThe imaginary friend as a political ploy works like this: There is no friend, but there is a point that needs to be made, and since someone around the country has experienced such hardship about said point, that experience is personified and personalized in the form of a friend\u2014a friend who doesn\u2019t exist but who suffers from real American, first world problems.

Paris is no longer Paris.\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out that Jim doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn this new millennium, it\u2019s become the way of the politician not only to create an imaginary friend but also to use said friend to advance a political agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump does this a lot, conjuring friends who don\u2019t exist. He claims that someone close to him has something to say, and that something is always in alignment with Trump\u2019s feelings. But that\u2019s because Trump is pathological. He\u2019s an ill-equipped communicator on the world stage and hardly trying to be loved. And never forget that Trump\u2019s agenda is always to push separatism, so he uses his imaginary friends for just such a reason.\n\nBut not all imaginary friends are the same; nor do they serve the same purpose. While Trump\u2019s friend Jim was used to send an anecdotal message about what happens when you open up the borders of a country, Booker and Carson have invented or embellished friends for quite a different reason: inclusion.\n\nWhen Cory Booker, now a senator from New Jersey, was mayor of Newark, N.J., he spoke of T-Bone. T-Bone was a ruthless drug lord from Jersey\u2019s Brick Towers low-income housing development who once threatened to kill Booker. T-Bone was also mentioned whenever Booker was trying to sell a story of how he understood the woes of growing up in a tough city like Newark. T-Bone became both Booker\u2019s hood pass and his mentee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how T-Bone was first introduced during a 2007 speech at the New School in New York City, according to NJ.com:\n\n\u201cI said hello to this guy and I\u2019ll never forget he leaped off the steps where he was standing and looked at me and threatened my life,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI later got to know this guy and his name was T-Bone and I\u2019m a vegetarian so that was a particularly vicious threat,\u201d Booker said to big laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker would later claim that T-Bone would come to him for legal advice.\n\nAfter being called out about T-Bone\u2019s legitimacy, Booker noted that T-Bone was real. Whether or not his name is actually T-Bone, though, has yet to be proved.\n\n\u201cHe is an archetype of so many people that are out there. He is 1,000 percent a real person,\u201d Booker said in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen NJ.com explored why people didn\u2019t call out Booker\u2019s questionable use of T-Bone, a telling answer came from Rahaman Muhammad, a city union leader who at the time was one of Booker\u2019s strongest critics.\n\n\u201cHe actually has real experiences that he can share,\u201d Muhammad told NJ.com. \u201cTo me this does not disqualify him from being a U.S. senator. These are urban stories that many of us have in this city. There may be different names, but there are many of these types of stories. Unfortunately, he made up a character for his story.\u201d\n\nNo politician, however, has done as masterly a job of deploying this narrative as former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, now secretary of housing and urban development. During his failed run for the White House, Carson weaved tales of debauchery and street toughness as if he were the black Chuck Norris. He once claimed that he stopped a stickup merely by pointing the robber toward the cash register. Most black people knew he was lying because he said that the alleged robbery attempt happened at a \u201cPopeyes organization.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is how CNN described Carson\u2019s tall tales:\n\nIn his 1990 autobiography, Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, Carson describes those acts as flowing from an uncontrollable \u201cpathological temper.\u201d The violent episodes he has detailed in his book, in public statements and in interviews, include punching a classmate in the face with his hand wrapped around a lock, leaving a bloody three-inch gash in the boy\u2019s forehead; attempting to attack his own mother with a hammer following an argument over clothes; hurling a large rock at a boy, which broke the youth\u2019s glasses and smashed his nose; and, finally, thrusting a knife at the belly of his friend with such force that the blade snapped when it luckily struck a belt buckle covered by the boy\u2019s clothes. \u201cI was trying to kill somebody,\u201d Carson said, describing the incident\u2014which he has said occurred at age 14 in ninth grade\u2014during a September forum at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. But nine friends, classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson told CNN they have no memory of the anger or violence the candidate has described.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is from a Yale-educated brain surgeon! The saddest part here is that Carson didn\u2019t feel that being one of the most decorated neurosurgeons was enough. He still needed a phoenixlike rise from the ashes of a hood like Baltimore to add legitimacy to his narrative.\n\nUnlike Trump, who is habitually horrible and is using everything at his disposal to destroy America, Booker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will\u2014for the crowd to show that they can move freely within both worlds.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a conundrum that all educated black men face: What do degrees mean inside the barbershop, and what does barbershop talk mean inside the hallowed halls of an Ivy League school? The funniest part of both Carson\u2019s and Booker\u2019s tales is that even in their use, they actually show how removed both men are.\n\n\u201cBlack men, almost by their very nature, have to perform. And Cory\u2014to some extent, the blackest part of him is that performance ethos,\u201d historian Clement Price told Esquire back in 2008 about Booker\u2019s friend T-Bone. The same could apply to Carson.\n\nBooker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe imaginary friend in Carson\u2019s narrative and Booker\u2019s exploratory use of T-Bone helps bolster their respective street cred, and in some regards, a politician needs street cred almost as much as a rapper does. When stumping for office, a politician needs stories that show not only that he will he lead the people but also that he is of the people. That he\u2019s one of them. That he, too, has had to fend off drug dealers.\n\nAnd so, in a weird, political way, the story of T-Bone becomes a Dickensian tale about the downturn of life, and serves as the foil to Booker the protagonist and his uplifting bootstraps. T-Bone serves an anecdotal purpose in the same way that we don\u2019t know if there was ever a real Brenda in Tupac\u2019s life, but we know that \u201cshe barely had a brain\u201d and that is was \u201ca damn shame that the girl could hardly spell her name.\u201d The \u201clife story\u201d somehow becomes the life.\n\nWe don\u2019t know Brenda, and nor do we care if she exists, but we know that Brenda speaks for a larger community, and that is what attracts us to Brenda\u2019s story. We know that she has struggled; we know that she is unable to handle the rigors of raising a newborn baby while still being a child herself. We feel for her. But in the end, it\u2019s a story, a fictional tale, an imagined hardship, a lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political landscape is changing, but the anecdotal story of a friend who once did something bad is as old as America itself. It has been employed by parents and teachers who warn of the bad kid who didn\u2019t listen and, as a result, ended up dead, so is it bad that politicians have not only employed fake friends but have mentored them, taken their advice, stabbed them in a rage-filled moment?\n\nThere is a theory that says it\u2019s OK to talk to an imaginary friend, but seek help should that friend start talking back.\n\nI think we may have jumped the shark.", "keywords": ["know", "politicians", "donald", "carson", "friend", "ben", "booker", "real", "political", "tbone", "bookers", "imaginary", "friends", "trump"], "polarity": -0.04338607752400856, "subjectivity": 0.44266924167786226},

You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they\u2019ll be right back up there,\u201dthe Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cAnd you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nCarson is a retired neurosurgeon who ran for president in 2016, and before entering into politics, he was a motivational speaker. He regularly discussed the fact that he grew up in poverty, and Lifetime found his life story so compelling, the network turned it into the TV movie Gifted Hands, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. While the biopic set him up to be an inspiration to poor kids everywhere, his conservative politics, constant denunciations of government assistance and the way his foot is always in his mouth have made most people give him an extreme side eye.\n\nCarson\u2019s comments were made during a town hall recorded Tuesday to air in full Wednesday night, and clips of the interview were released to news organizations to promote the show, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson said \u201cthe wrong mindset\u201d is the product of negative parenting habits and exposure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a poverty spirit. You develop a certain mindset,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Carson said he believes the government can help people looking to climb out of poverty, he warned against programs that are \u201csustaining them in a position of poverty.

The cuts would end popular grants that facilitate first-time home ownership and revitalize economically distressed communities, including the Community Development Block Grant. The budget would also cut billions of dollars in funding for public housing support, gutting dollars used to fund big-ticket repairs at public housing developments around the country. Carson has spoken at length in the past about personal responsibility and its intersection with poverty, bemoaning systemic dependence on public assistance. On the campaign trail, Carson repeatedly pushed back against accusations that he wanted to end social safety net programs; he stressed, instead, that he believed government assistance was not always given to people who truly needed it. \u201cI have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people,\u201d he said in the 2015 speech announcing his candidacy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not doing people a favor when we pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, you poor little thing, we\u2019re going to take care of all your needs. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u2019 You know who else says stuff like that? Socialists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment, but Williams did, and in an interview with the Post Wednesday evening, he defended Carson and said his views are based not on politics but on what is just.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of faith, not a man of politics,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDr. Carson believes in what is righteous, what is good, what is fair and what is just.\u201c\n\nSo remember, kids, poverty is just a state of mind. When Sallie Mae/Navient calls you to collect on those student loans next month, tell them that you don\u2019t owe them, and your monthly payment being late is just a state of mind. Remind them that if they keep this mindset, it\u2019s going to feel as if everyone owes them money when they really don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["state", "carson", "ben", "parents", "passed", "thinks", "children", "mindset", "post", "dont", "politics", "way", "poverty", "mind", "williams"], "polarity": 0.09328165374677003, "subjectivity": 0.4390166680864355},

Rettenmaier was convicted of child pornography. Rettenmaier was reported by someone working at the Geek Squad\u2019s Brooks, Ky., facility, where technicians repair computers of Best Buy customers from around the country.\n\nThe EFF sought to know if the informants simply stumbled across the data on the hard drive or if they had been directed and trained to do so. Civil liberties advocates argue that, if the Geek Squad workers are paid by the FBI, then searching computers without a warrant might be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (That\u2019s the one that protects against illegal search and seizure. Don\u2019t worry, Donald Trump didn\u2019t know it, either.)\n\nWhat they found was startling. They discovered that Geek Squad workers, under the knowledge and direction of Best Buy, had been working with federal investigators for at least 10 years as \u201cconfidential human sources,\u201d or CHS, rummaging through the hard drives of people who had not been arrested or convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an unclassified FBI memo (pdf), in September 2008, the FBI held a meeting at the Best Buy Kentucky offices. The document boasted of the company\u2019s cozy relationship with the FBI:\n\nThe Brooks facility repairs and conducts data recovery on thousands of computers every day. The [FBI\u2019s] Louisville Division has maintained close liaison with the Geek Squad\u2019s management in an effort to glean case initiations and to support the division\u2019s Computer Intrusion and Cyber Crime programs.\n\nThe information obtained by the EFF shows the evolution of a detailed process that begins when workers find potentially illegal material on hard drives. The techs relay the information to the FBI, which then investigates the data and sends the information to a field office near the customer\u2019s home for further investigation. However, it was the next step that is most important:\n\nThen the FBI would sometimes obtain a warrant.\n\nEven in cases that were not prosecuted, Best Buy employees would make exact copies of the hard drive on blank drives, CDs and flash drives and forward the borrowed data to the FBI. In most of the cases, the FBI notes made sure to specify that no warrant was obtained prior to the Snitch Squad\u2019s search.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe documents noted that the feds rewarded the Geek Squad techs up to $500 for each time they found incriminating evidence. In at least one case, child pornography was gleaned from unallocated space on the drive. The Geek Squad somehow got the contents of the drive to the FBI despite the fact that, without forensic tools, the Geek Squad couldn\u2019t have known that the material was on the drive; nor did they have any reason to inspect unallocated space.\n\nThe FBI, however, insisted that it did not instruct Best Buy employees to proactively search for information. If you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I\u2019m going to scream, and I need a second to switch to all caps and italics:\n\nTHAT DOES NOT MAKE US FEEL BETTER!\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to breathe a sigh of relief knowing that we could be arrested for something on our hard drives even if the FBI wasn\u2019t investigating us? Seriously, why would you ever mention that part? The fact that Geek Squadders are paid to find any violation means they will search every computer they come across, in hopes of finding something illegal!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you know what people will do for $500? When I was in college, my friends and I drove to a party about an hour away. We didn\u2019t have enough room for everyone, and one of our friends laughingly suggested that he\u2019d ride in the trunk. Five of us chipped in $10 apiece and bet him he wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nHe took the bet.\n\nFor $50.\n\nHaving a squad of paid informants is problematic in that it is possible that the Geek Squad could not only extract information but could ultimately plant information and files on someone\u2019s hard drive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did not release all of the documents, claiming that some were privileged information, so no one knows exactly how many customers\u2019 computers Geek Squad employees rifled through. The FBI also refused to say whether or not this program exists at other Best Buy facilities or at any other private companies.\n\nI\u2019m just happy the Geek Squad doesn\u2019t have a team roving around inspecting car trunks.", "keywords": ["snitching", "information", "squad", "drives", "buy", "best", "drive", "geek", "customers", "fbi", "data", "report", "hard", "dry"], "polarity": 0.12634648370497426, "subjectivity": 0.4492876201366768},

He is a professional rapper, having been one for over a decade, and his professional rappings are quite proficient and popular. Compared to the average person \u2014 or, even better, compared to me when I attempt to rap (which often occurs when drunk and eating Thai-style fried rice) \u2014 he is great at putting sentences that happen to rhyme at the conclusion of each line together and rapping them in a coherent manner over a background musical accompaniment. The distance in quality between him rapping and you rapping is the distance between a Chick-fil-A spicy chicken sandwich and you attempting to make a spicy chicken sandwich by catching a live chicken and attempting to sandwich him between two slices of Wonder Bread. So yes, he is good at rapping. This is an objective and inarguable truth.\n\n2. Objectively, Rick Ross's level of goodness (or perhaps even greatness) is difficult to assess and quantify, because the answer is inextricably dependent on A) how you define quality in this context and B) how you personally feel about Rick Ross, the person who raps. That said, I will attempt to answer this as best I can. And the answer is I don't know.\n\nI've been listening to rap music for roughly 30 years now. The first cassette I owned was LL Cool J's I'm Bad. The first record was Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. And in between those purchases and my latest download (Drake's pretentiously kaleidoscopic More Life), I've listened to, studied, debated, and argued about every rap artist worth listening to, studying, debating, and arguing about. Which is why I have no reservations with saying that Rick Ross is one of the most gifted rappers ever. Not one of the five or 10 best (more on that later) but one of the five or 10 most talented. If a checklist existed listing every desirable quality a rapper could possess \u2014 a Zillow or Trulia for MCs \u2014 he'd fill every box.\n\nIt starts, of course, with his voice, which is one of hip-hop's greatest and most recognizable. It's deep and baritone and thunderous without being cacophonous and distracting. And syrupy without being saccharin. He wields it like an instrument; enunciating and resonating without seeming to need to put much effort into either. Even his ad-libs and grunts have meaning. Or, at least, seem to have meaning. He could say \"I went to the store; got a bucket to eat\" and grunt and leave you convinced that God just descended from the Heavens to order a two piece and a biscuit. He also comes equipped with an embarrassingly effortless flow that makes him impervious to suffocation. Even the best rappers occasionally get swallowed by good production. But aside from Biggie, Rozay is the only rapper who never seems to get overpowered by the beat. When he's on a song, he makes it his.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the best example of this occurs on \"Lord Knows\" \u2014 which A) many people consider to be Drake's best collection of verses ever (personally, I'd go with \"6PM in New York\") and B) is one of the best and most ambitious tracks ever from Just Blaze, one of the best hip-hop producers ever. To his credit, Drake acquits himself quite well on the beat. But his verses are accompanied by a strain of insecurity. You listen to him and you know that he is trying very, very, very, very hard to kill it and not get killed by it. But when it's Ross's turn to spit, the difference in confidence and presence is palpable. It's almost as if someone said \"we need to get a grown-up on this song.\" And then a grown-up showed up, and did in 45 seconds what Drake couldn't do in three and a half minutes.\n\n(Seriously, you listen to that song and start thinking the face Drake's making on the album cover is the face he made after comparing his verse to Rozay's.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, while Ross's subject matter is infamous for lacking variation, there's enough diversity and creativity within his writing and his concepts to make the same subjects \u2014 usually limited to Bentleys, kilos, bitches, bitch niggas, and regrets \u2014 remain entertaining. He's consistent and reliable without being mundane and boring.\n\nSo why, when asking myself if he's a good rapper, was my answer \"I don't know\" instead of the clear resounding \"Yes\" it would seem to be? Well, the \"I don't know\" stems from a factor I try to shy away from when judging and assessing rappers. But, in this context and with this particular rapper and this particular question, it's too important to ignore: Record Sales.\n\nIn 11 years, Rick Ross has released nine solo and three collaborative albums. Of those, Port of Miami is the only one to reach platinum status, and that happened 10 years after it was released. Sales usually are not an effective rubric when assessing quality, as the only thing they measure is a very specific type of popularity and marketability. (Hi Nicki!) But his music is known for its lushness and luxuriousness; you listen to him, and not only do you believe he's a billionaire, he makes you feel like you're a billionaire too. When my Spotify playlist happened upon Rozay and I happened to be driving, my Charger morphed into a Maybach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, each album is practically a who's who of Niggas With Islands And Shit. And is released with the pomp and circumstance of a royal engagement party. Teflon Don alone featured John Legend, Jay Z, Cee-lo, T.I., Jadakiss, Erykah Badu, Diddy, Kanye, Ne-Yo, Trey Songz, Drake, Gucci Mane, Styles P, Chrisette Michele, and Raphael Saadiq. That's a shitton of rich niggas with extensive Wikipedia pages. And he shamelessly shoehorns formulaic songs on these albums; tracks whose main objective is to hopefully give said albums the best possible chance at selling millions of copies. He has attempted, 12 times now, to create blockbusters, not masterpieces, and he's failed each time. It's Michael Bay's sensibility with Wes Anderson's box office.\n\nAnd, it can not be ignored that while most trap rap offers at least a plausible fabrication of hood realities \u2014 you know that the person rapping probably doesn't do what he raps about anymore but has at some point in the past \u2014 Rick Ross is transparently counterfeit. Not only did he not sell drugs, he detained people who sold them. Which, in a macro sense, isn't a bad thing. It's better to lock criminals up than to do crimes and shit, I guess. But in the micro world of rap music, perhaps this anti-meta lack of authenticity is an invisible albatross holding him back.\n\nThat said, I generally like his albums. Even sometimes more than albums I recognize as objectively better. (I've probably listened to God Forgives I Don't three times as much as To Pimp A Butterfly, and I believe Rich Forever is the best mixtape ever.) So I remain tempted to answer \"Yes! Definitely! Rick Ross is absolutely a great rapper!\" even while knowing I might be wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut just as I know that the 10th Rick Ross solo album, whenever it's released, won't be much different than the first, I know that some time this week, I'll be riding around Pittsburgh listening to Rather You Than Me. And I'll feel like a billionaire while doing it.

Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

And by \u201cwe\u201d I mean, \u201cif you\u2019re black and you\u2019ve ever been behind the wheel of a car.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re driving along, minding your black-ass business, and blasting Rick Ross or some other unapologetically ignant music at obnoxious levels, and you glance into your rearview and notice a cop behind you with the flashers on.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you say, as you quickly scan your car for any possible item\u2014a toy gun, another black person, a box of Kleenex, etc.\u2014that could possibly scare the cop enough to arrest and/or shoot you. Scan complete, you then consider turning down your music. And then, after 0.000001 seconds of consideration, you turn down your fucking music because you don\u2019t want them to accuse you of assaulting a cop\u2019s eardrums or some shit and have justification to shoot you.\n\nTurning down the music isn\u2019t enough, though. The cop might roll up to your window right in the middle of one of Rozay\u2019s grunts, and even a low-volume Rozay grunt is enough to scare a cop enough to shoot you. So you have to quickly find a new song.\n\nBecause this scenario occurs far more often than it should, I assume that most of you have at least a few dozen songs you know you can switch to when this happens. These songs aren\u2019t necessarily only on your playlists for this reason. You do genuinely like them. They just also happen to be, well, less likely to lead to your death by cop. It\u2019s kinda like if you happen to invite Susan or Connor from work to your game night, and the party makes so much noise that someone calls the cops, guess who just got nominated for door-answering and cop-appeasing duty? Basically, these songs are your Susan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, here are my most popular go-tos.\n\n1. \u201cLet It Happen,\u201d by Tame Impala\n\nIt\u2019s peppy enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTalk Show Host,\u201d by Radiohead\n\nIt\u2019s somber enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\n3. \u201cTo the Max,\u201d by Drake\n\nIt\u2019s Drake enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cCould We Start Again, Please?\u201d by Yvonne Elliman (from Jesus Christ Superstar)\n\nIt\u2019s Jesus-y enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\n5. \u201cWhite Rabbit,\u201d by Jefferson Airplane\n\nIt\u2019s hippie enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cIntegrity,\u201d by Ne-Yo\n\nIt\u2019s corny and sweet enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\n7. \u201cDream Is Collapsing,\u201d by Hans Zimmer (From the Inception soundtrack)\n\nIt\u2019s dramatic enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cSeigfried,\u201d by Frank Ocean\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\n9. \u201cLove on Top,\u201d by Beyonc\u00e9\n\nIt\u2019s happy enough to maybe prevent you getting shot in the face by a terrified cop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cI Am a God,\u201d by Kanye West\n\nShit.

Before the youngest spawns of Kris Jenner officially embraced the Kardashian way and jumped the \u201ccelebreality\u201d shark, they were like Thing 1 and Thing 2 to me, background players that were indiscernible from one another. Kris\u2019 obsession with starting all her client's, I mean, kid\u2019s names with the letter K didn\u2019t help matters much either. But I\u2019ve gotten much better.\n\nI know that Thing 1 aka Kylie is in a relationship with Chris Brown\u2019s stunt double who sometimes puts out music that people much younger than me might listen to while intoxicated. I think at some point in the past few years she had an allergic reaction to shellfish or something that caused her lips to swell up. That or she got a new face, but I think it was shellfish. It\u2019s always shellfish. Oh, and she has/had beef with a Blac Chinese woman. That\u2019s basically the full extent of my Cliff Notes on Thing 1 aka Kylie.\n\nNow Thing 2 aka Kendall is the one that models. From what I know it\u2019s like real modeling. You know, like pictures that were not taken on a mobile device and don\u2019t only get published on Instagram and websites that tend to embed said images. She might do that too, but Thing 2 aka Kendall actually hits runways and gets published in fashion magazines and stuff. They still make those, right?\n\nAnyway, I generally don\u2019t make a habit of keeping tabs on what Thing 1 or Thing 2 do or say, but that changed when I kept seeing Thing 2\u2019s name pop up in my newsfeed with headlines like \u201cKendall Jenner Says \u2018I\u2019m Cool With My Breasts\u2019 On Decision to Go Braless.\u201d That\u2019s when I said to myself, \u201cHey, Self, we\u2019re cool with breasts too, right? Yeah, I thought so. This sounds right up our alley so let\u2019s go ahead and read up about some cool breasts.\u201d\n\nLong story short, it turns out that Thing 2 wrote something called \u201cFree the Nipple!\u201d on her website/app. I don\u2019t know why she has a website/app but I guess it\u2019s a thing. Whatever the reason I still refuse to subscribe to the darn thing just so I can read what she wrote. Seven-day free trial be damned. But there\u2019s a way around her pesky pay wall called Google, and according to People, Thing 2 said:\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see what the big deal is with going braless. I think it\u2019s cool and I really just don\u2019t care! It\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s comfortable and I\u2019m cool with my breasts. That\u2019s it! \u2026 It\u2019s also a fun way to show off my different nipple rings. [Jewelry designer] Jacquie Aiche made me a couple of pieces that are really sick, like a pair of angel wings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAww, angel wings. That sounds precious, but I digress\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t see what the big deal is either. If Rick Ross can walk around braless; why can\u2019t Thing 2? I mean, it\u2019s only fair. If we all have to suffer through seeing PDAMB (public displays of awkward man boobs) the payoff should be the opportunity of seeing a better boob. If Kendall wants to be this generation\u2019s Ms. Jackson (because she\u2019s nasty), then who are we to stop her? If she\u2019s cool with her breasts, goddammit I\u2019m cool with them, too.\n\nWhen it comes to the whole idea about not wearing a bra in public, I really don\u2019t see what the big fuss is. As long as releasing the Kraken from the confines of your bra doesn\u2019t put any young children in harm\u2019s way when they swing low sweet chariot I say go for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is unless, of course, we\u2019re related. Then all bets are off.\n\nI\u2019d prefer that anyone I share a gene pool with or who married into my family not partake in Kendall\u2019s free nip movement. Yes, it\u2019s contradictory, but that\u2019s my prerogative. Word to Bobby Brown. Pookie n\u2019em might wanna see my eighteenth cousin on my great uncle\u2019s stepdaughter\u2019s side free the nipple but not me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m strictly down with O.P.B. (other people\u2019s breasts).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a happily married man, I\u2019ve committed myself to having direct contact with only one pair for the rest of my life, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t go window-shopping on occasion just to see what new models are on the market. With Kendall talking about angel wings and whatnot it sounds like Victoria has been keeping some secrets that I need to look into. That or I totally misinterpreted what Beyonc\u00e9 meant when she said, \u201cIf you liked then you should\u2019ve put a ring on it.\u201d\n\nEither way a free nipple ain\u2019t never hurt nobody.

Not to be confused with Betsy DeVos, the other clueless blonde hired by the Trump administration, Van Duyne is the two-term mayor of Irving, Texas, where she was the first woman to serve in that post. She was chosen for her new position by Carson, the former brain surgeon and Jesus superfan who doesn\u2019t believe in evolution (because it is \u201cencouraged by Satan\u201d) and who once said that the Bible takes precedence over the Constitution.\n\nVan Duyne, a longtime Islamophobe, has warned people about Muslim bogeymen seeking to destroy \u201cour freedoms,\u201d plot terrorist attacks and take our bacon away. Two years ago she convinced the Irving City Council to endorse a bill by a Texas state legislator that sought to stop Shariah law\u2014even though no one was advancing Shariah law. Although the bill did not specifically mention Islam, the Dallas Morning News reported that the wording of the proposed law was almost exactly like that of a bill that had been introduced a few years earlier to stop the influence of \u201clarge groups of Middle Easterners.\u201d\n\nVan Duyne was also sued by Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Irving student who was arrested after he brought a clock to school and school officials thought it was a bomb, because ... you know ... his name is Ahmed Mohamed. Van Duyne rushed to Facebook to defend the police officers who arrested the 14-year-old (she later changed the post to make it not so anti-Muslim).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot satisfied with her besmirchment of the teenager, Beth Badass sat down with Glenn Beck to further defend the police officers and teachers and to blame it on the boy and, of course, President Barack Obama:\n\nWe\u2019ve heard more from the media than the child ever released to the police when we were asking him questions. He told a lot more to the reporters than he ever told to the police. There\u2019s a problem with that. If your child was in that school and you saw something like this come in, you would want to make sure it is our priority to make our children safe in school, period.

Today we hear from Dustin Seibert as he tells us how Tame Impala helped him move on from a difficult part of life.\n\nThis story is not of an album that changed my life so much as it\u2019s one that\u2019s connected to the most profound shift in my adult life.\n\n\n\nAbout a decade ago, I dated a young lady named Marie*. Of the many women I\u2019ve gone out with since graduating from college, Marie is singular in that she influenced my musical proclivities unlike any woman before or since her. She put me on to artists and bands\u2014mostly alternative and indie rock\u2014that I likely would never have discovered on my own. We fell into a routine where she would send me new music nearly every week. My playlists\u2014and my musical palate\u2014are all better because of her.\n\n\n\nShortly after I met Junebug*, my wife-to-be, I stopped dating Marie. But I kept up with Marie\u2014writing her maybe once a month on Facebook\u2014with the sole intention of getting new music suggestions from her. When Junebug agreed to move in with me after a year of dating, she did so under the condition that I give up Veritas, my cat of seven years, with whom she didn\u2019t want to live. Marie had grown fond of him and agreed to take him in to prevent me from having to put him in a shelter.\n\n\n\nThree months after we moved in, Junebug and I had a massive fight over an innocuous conversation (read: No game was thrown, no nudes traded) I had with a female associate on Facebook that she read in real time from another computer I was logged in on. Though I\u2019d mentioned this woman in passing to Junebug in the past, it essentially incensed her that I was talking to a woman she didn\u2019t know. The fight sent me to stay at my friend\u2019s crib and literally drove me to my knees in tears, begging her not to leave me.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unwanted consequence of staying together was my need to submit to her invading every corner of my privacy\u2014emails, texts, social media. Her probe revealed that I was still reaching out to Marie for music. I never attempted to hide these interactions from Junebug\u2014especially considering that Marie had adopted my pet\u2014but it was still a problem: She wrote Marie a detailed letter essentially asking if we were still messing around with each other. Of course, Marie forwarded me the letter.\n\n\n\nI agreed to cut off Marie, which meant no more music recommendations. But that fight, despite not keeping us from walking down the aisle, set off a degree of mistrust and monitoring that haunted our entire relationship and played a large role in its eventual destruction. When we divorced at the beginning of 2016, one of my first acts of \u201cliberation\u201d was to renew contact with Marie to get new music.\n\n\n\nThe first album she recommended to me after more than four years: Tame Impala\u2019s Currents.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d never heard of the album or the artist. But I fell in love with Currents quickly and deeply. After nearly two years, I still play it like I just discovered it, which I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve done with any album of any genre. I bought the vinyl and had the jacket professionally framed. I had the album playing when my mama visited me one time and she liked it, so I bought her a copy and she also still plays it like it\u2019s new.\n\n\n\nDivorce, as you might imagine, is a traumatic experience that cannot be diminished by the quality of one album\u2014discovering Currents wasn\u2019t \u201cworth\u201d it. But the album has served as a soundtrack to my post-marital life\u2014one whose lyrics just happen to convey the myriad emotions that accompany a breakup. It\u2019s an amazing body of work that will remind me of that period of my life until I\u2019m pushing daisies.\n\n\n\n*Names have been changed to protect me from getting fucked up out in these streets.", "keywords": ["impalas", "album", "music", "woman", "agreed", "marie", "fight", "currents", "junebug", "soundtrack", "tame", "life", "changed", "postdivorce", "week"], "polarity": 0.10553362759245109, "subjectivity": 0.4511345952522423},

Rettenmaier was convicted of child pornography. Rettenmaier was reported by someone working at the Geek Squad\u2019s Brooks, Ky., facility, where technicians repair computers of Best Buy customers from around the country.\n\nThe EFF sought to know if the informants simply stumbled across the data on the hard drive or if they had been directed and trained to do so. Civil liberties advocates argue that, if the Geek Squad workers are paid by the FBI, then searching computers without a warrant might be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (That\u2019s the one that protects against illegal search and seizure. Don\u2019t worry, Donald Trump didn\u2019t know it, either.)\n\nWhat they found was startling. They discovered that Geek Squad workers, under the knowledge and direction of Best Buy, had been working with federal investigators for at least 10 years as \u201cconfidential human sources,\u201d or CHS, rummaging through the hard drives of people who had not been arrested or convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an unclassified FBI memo (pdf), in September 2008, the FBI held a meeting at the Best Buy Kentucky offices. The document boasted of the company\u2019s cozy relationship with the FBI:\n\nThe Brooks facility repairs and conducts data recovery on thousands of computers every day. The [FBI\u2019s] Louisville Division has maintained close liaison with the Geek Squad\u2019s management in an effort to glean case initiations and to support the division\u2019s Computer Intrusion and Cyber Crime programs.\n\nThe information obtained by the EFF shows the evolution of a detailed process that begins when workers find potentially illegal material on hard drives. The techs relay the information to the FBI, which then investigates the data and sends the information to a field office near the customer\u2019s home for further investigation. However, it was the next step that is most important:\n\nThen the FBI would sometimes obtain a warrant.\n\nEven in cases that were not prosecuted, Best Buy employees would make exact copies of the hard drive on blank drives, CDs and flash drives and forward the borrowed data to the FBI. In most of the cases, the FBI notes made sure to specify that no warrant was obtained prior to the Snitch Squad\u2019s search.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe documents noted that the feds rewarded the Geek Squad techs up to $500 for each time they found incriminating evidence. In at least one case, child pornography was gleaned from unallocated space on the drive. The Geek Squad somehow got the contents of the drive to the FBI despite the fact that, without forensic tools, the Geek Squad couldn\u2019t have known that the material was on the drive; nor did they have any reason to inspect unallocated space.\n\nThe FBI, however, insisted that it did not instruct Best Buy employees to proactively search for information. If you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I\u2019m going to scream, and I need a second to switch to all caps and italics:\n\nTHAT DOES NOT MAKE US FEEL BETTER!\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to breathe a sigh of relief knowing that we could be arrested for something on our hard drives even if the FBI wasn\u2019t investigating us? Seriously, why would you ever mention that part? The fact that Geek Squadders are paid to find any violation means they will search every computer they come across, in hopes of finding something illegal!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you know what people will do for $500? When I was in college, my friends and I drove to a party about an hour away. We didn\u2019t have enough room for everyone, and one of our friends laughingly suggested that he\u2019d ride in the trunk. Five of us chipped in $10 apiece and bet him he wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nHe took the bet.\n\nFor $50.\n\nHaving a squad of paid informants is problematic in that it is possible that the Geek Squad could not only extract information but could ultimately plant information and files on someone\u2019s hard drive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did not release all of the documents, claiming that some were privileged information, so no one knows exactly how many customers\u2019 computers Geek Squad employees rifled through. The FBI also refused to say whether or not this program exists at other Best Buy facilities or at any other private companies.\n\nI\u2019m just happy the Geek Squad doesn\u2019t have a team roving around inspecting car trunks.", "keywords": ["snitching", "information", "squad", "drives", "buy", "best", "drive", "geek", "customers", "fbi", "data", "report", "hard", "dry"], "polarity": 0.12634648370497426, "subjectivity": 0.4492876201366768},

I've read several articles about this because I've honestly been trying to understand and what I've come up with is that there is no understanding to be had. Why an HBCU would chose to pick a member of Trump's administration so aggressively hostile towards minority communities and, frankly, actual education, is beyond me.\n\nI don't know if common sense is on vacation, and recent ads for damn near everything insinuate that to the be the case, but an actual Black institution of higher learning taking such a transparent stance towards ass kissing is embarrassing. That is the only plausible reason why anybody from this administration would be asked, especially Betsy DeVos, a woman who released an ENTIRE press release that explicitly outlined her lack of knowledge about why HBCUs even exist.\n\nLet her come to the school to sit down and be educated. Giving her the country to come and speak to a legion of new graduates is tone deaf in a way that would be impressive if it wasn't so sad.\n\nBut not quite as sad as this shit:\n\nIn a news release Monday, the university said: \u201cMuch like Dr. Bethune, Founder of Bethune-Cookman University, Secretary DeVos deems the importance of opportunity and hope for students to receive an exceptional education experience. Her mission to empower parents and students resonates with the history and legacy of Dr. Bethune.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoy stop. Mary McLeod Bethune probably sat up in her grave at the comparison. Also, shit, you could say that about ANYBODY who believes good schooling is a win. There are people who HATE school who are like, \"I mean, if you're gonna have school, it is important for opportunity and hope and shit.\" Jaden Smith would agree with that and I think he's viewed school as some sort of telepathic bridge to nowhere since he was like four. In that case, Mary McLeod Bethune and Jaden Smith\u2026same shit.\n\nI will extend some grace, Lord knows we all need it, and assume that BC did this for some reason that belies logic BUT was done with pure altruism at heart. Maybe Betsy said that she'd promise them a new, I don't know, research center if they'd let her come speak because nobody else wants to hear shit she has to say. I have no clue. And statements like this, \"The release also noted the importance of funding from the Education Department, and praised DeVos for her charitable contributions\" somewhat alludes to SOMETHING along those lines.\n\nWhile there are way worse individuals to have come speak to your institution - Richard Spencer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Ben Casron, etc. all immediately come to mind\u2026you know what, Ben Carson shouldn't be an option but if you HAVE to pick somebody from the administration at least he DID positively impact the world at some point and is Black even if his relationship with what slavery actually was is tenuous. He pretty much lit his entire pre-political career on fire, but I'm saying, if we ARE extending invites and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, Bethune-Cookman University should be ashamed. Yes, this will be a non-thing in a few weeks. Nobody is coming from far and wide to hear her speak. And it also seems like her speaking is going to happen no matter what petitions or protests exist. Plus, are you going to skip out on your graduation because of the speaker? I think not. Perhaps a flash mob style insertion of ear plugs when she started speaking could be an effective tool of silent protest. Yo no se.\n\nThen again, my alma mater has Van Jones speaking and I guess he can't stop stepping in shit either though I'd imagine the weight of sensibility is weighing pretty heavily in Morehouse's favor in comparison.

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

The statue, a two-month collaboration between street artists Plastic Jesus and Joshua \u201cGinger\u201d Monroe, according to ABC News, shows Weinstein on a casting couch\u2014an allusion to dozens of allegations of sexual misconduct and rape that have been made against the film mogul. Multiple prominent actresses, including Ashley Judd, Uma Thurman, Angelina Jolie and Lupita Nyong\u2019o, have accused Weinstein of harassing them or soliciting sexual favors in return for advancing their careers.\n\nThe statue, its creators say, was intended to draw attention to Weinstein\u2019s abuses and the culture that enabled and protected them. Dressed in a bathrobe and pajamas, the garishly gold statue of Weinstein sits on the couch and looks out in the distance. One hand stretches out across the back of his seat; the other clutches a gold Oscar trophy.", "keywords": ["statue", "oscars", "minds", "metoo", "code", "sexual", "hollywood", "dress", "red", "times", "reporters", "told", "street", "weinstein", "movement", "peoples"], "polarity": 0.03517839687194525, "subjectivity": 0.43293010752688177},

Rettenmaier was convicted of child pornography. Rettenmaier was reported by someone working at the Geek Squad\u2019s Brooks, Ky., facility, where technicians repair computers of Best Buy customers from around the country.\n\nThe EFF sought to know if the informants simply stumbled across the data on the hard drive or if they had been directed and trained to do so. Civil liberties advocates argue that, if the Geek Squad workers are paid by the FBI, then searching computers without a warrant might be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (That\u2019s the one that protects against illegal search and seizure. Don\u2019t worry, Donald Trump didn\u2019t know it, either.)\n\nWhat they found was startling. They discovered that Geek Squad workers, under the knowledge and direction of Best Buy, had been working with federal investigators for at least 10 years as \u201cconfidential human sources,\u201d or CHS, rummaging through the hard drives of people who had not been arrested or convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an unclassified FBI memo (pdf), in September 2008, the FBI held a meeting at the Best Buy Kentucky offices. The document boasted of the company\u2019s cozy relationship with the FBI:\n\nThe Brooks facility repairs and conducts data recovery on thousands of computers every day. The [FBI\u2019s] Louisville Division has maintained close liaison with the Geek Squad\u2019s management in an effort to glean case initiations and to support the division\u2019s Computer Intrusion and Cyber Crime programs.\n\nThe information obtained by the EFF shows the evolution of a detailed process that begins when workers find potentially illegal material on hard drives. The techs relay the information to the FBI, which then investigates the data and sends the information to a field office near the customer\u2019s home for further investigation. However, it was the next step that is most important:\n\nThen the FBI would sometimes obtain a warrant.\n\nEven in cases that were not prosecuted, Best Buy employees would make exact copies of the hard drive on blank drives, CDs and flash drives and forward the borrowed data to the FBI. In most of the cases, the FBI notes made sure to specify that no warrant was obtained prior to the Snitch Squad\u2019s search.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe documents noted that the feds rewarded the Geek Squad techs up to $500 for each time they found incriminating evidence. In at least one case, child pornography was gleaned from unallocated space on the drive. The Geek Squad somehow got the contents of the drive to the FBI despite the fact that, without forensic tools, the Geek Squad couldn\u2019t have known that the material was on the drive; nor did they have any reason to inspect unallocated space.\n\nThe FBI, however, insisted that it did not instruct Best Buy employees to proactively search for information. If you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I\u2019m going to scream, and I need a second to switch to all caps and italics:\n\nTHAT DOES NOT MAKE US FEEL BETTER!\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to breathe a sigh of relief knowing that we could be arrested for something on our hard drives even if the FBI wasn\u2019t investigating us? Seriously, why would you ever mention that part? The fact that Geek Squadders are paid to find any violation means they will search every computer they come across, in hopes of finding something illegal!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you know what people will do for $500? When I was in college, my friends and I drove to a party about an hour away. We didn\u2019t have enough room for everyone, and one of our friends laughingly suggested that he\u2019d ride in the trunk. Five of us chipped in $10 apiece and bet him he wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nHe took the bet.\n\nFor $50.\n\nHaving a squad of paid informants is problematic in that it is possible that the Geek Squad could not only extract information but could ultimately plant information and files on someone\u2019s hard drive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did not release all of the documents, claiming that some were privileged information, so no one knows exactly how many customers\u2019 computers Geek Squad employees rifled through. The FBI also refused to say whether or not this program exists at other Best Buy facilities or at any other private companies.\n\nI\u2019m just happy the Geek Squad doesn\u2019t have a team roving around inspecting car trunks.", "keywords": ["snitching", "information", "squad", "drives", "buy", "best", "drive", "geek", "customers", "fbi", "data", "report", "hard", "dry"], "polarity": 0.12634648370497426, "subjectivity": 0.4492876201366768},

But first, an apology.\n\n\n\nI want to apologize to all the listeners who have had to endure over 30 episodes of The Root\u2019s podcast and have not been able to fully embrace the featheriness (is that a word?) of my voice. I don\u2019t want to brag, but I\u2019ve been told that I have the voice of a dove whose tonsils have been dipped in gold and shined by a cloud. The point is that my voice is heavenly and I\u2019m sorry that you have not been able to really hear all the heavenliness (also not sure if that\u2019s a word) in it.\n\nI\u2019m also sorry for the show\u2019s host (she calls herself that), Patti LaDanielle, also known as The Root\u2019s social-content producer, Danielle Young. Nothing has happened or not happened with her, but I just want to apologize for her and my inability to get her ousted from her position.\n\n\n\nCurrently I\u2019m pushing a narrative that Patti LaDanielle and Russian operatives made rum cake in her apartment before the 2016 election; hopefully this will be enough to force her resignation. I\u2019ll keep you guys posted.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019re back like we never left, and we know that we\u2019ve been teasing y\u2019all about how we were going to get fly and free and leave you guys, but we have real-life podcasting equipment now.

In fact, it\u2019s clearer than mine; I assure you that I couldn\u2019t stop this. I talked to technical people who understand this stuff, because, yes, we have technical people now (humble brag). So her voice is clear as well\u2014at least until she is found out to be a spy for the Russians.\n\nSo now all of our listeners can hear us clearly clown the shit out of all these HBCU presidents who ran over to the White House just knowing that they were going to get some money, only to find out that Trump used all their black faces for a photo op.\n\nWe also wax Carson for being in \u201cthe sunken place\u201d with his latest dumb-ass comments claiming that slaves were immigrants with a dream. Umm, no, the fuck, they weren\u2019t; they were slaves. We can\u2019t be the only ones perplexed by Carson\u2019s bullish attempts to single-handedly undo his legacy as one of the world\u2019s greatest neurosurgeons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also admit to some or our fattest moments. Sometimes Ms. Patti Patti and I get along and bond over the weird things we do. In this case, we talk about fast food and the fat habits we have. Ms. Patti Patti may or may not get something from Taco Bell and Wendy\u2019s to make one pleasant meal. And I may or may not have once asked a McDonald\u2019s worker to make me a sundae in a medium drink cup.\n\nNow that we are stepping up our game\u2014and by \u201cstepping up our game,\u201d I mean that women can hear me clearly\u2014I believe that our numbers will skyrocket.

Scan complete, you then consider turning down your music. And then, after 0.000001 seconds of consideration, you turn down your fucking music because you don\u2019t want them to accuse you of assaulting a cop\u2019s eardrums or some shit and have justification to shoot you.\n\nTurning down the music isn\u2019t enough, though. The cop might roll up to your window right in the middle of one of Rozay\u2019s grunts, and even a low-volume Rozay grunt is enough to scare a cop enough to shoot you. So you have to quickly find a new song.\n\nBecause this scenario occurs far more often than it should, I assume that most of you have at least a few dozen songs you know you can switch to when this happens. These songs aren\u2019t necessarily only on your playlists for this reason. You do genuinely like them. They just also happen to be, well, less likely to lead to your death by cop.

The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money. With another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, nothing has been done, and all of this comes on the heels of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s warning that Russia was already looking to interfere in the 2018 midterms.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s their intention to interfere, they\u2019re going to find ways to do that,\u201d Tillerson told Fox News last month. \u201cAnd we can take steps we can take, but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it, it\u2019s very difficult to pre-empt it.\u201d\n\nOh, Mr. Tillerson, I have an idea of how we can attempt to pre-empt Russian interference.

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

Nevertheless, I am going to talk to you even though I fear you vacated your body a long time ago. I believe you sent yourself away where no one could touch you. You went crazy first and now you exist in parts. You, dear Ben, are a man who once was. But being a woman of hope, I ask: can you walk a ways and see where your heart is? I imagine it used to beat with such vigor and passion, a magic heart.\n\nI believe you are dying a slow death in the shell of your skin, because what else could bring you to say enslaved human beings who were stacked atop each other with no room to move or breathe or relieve themselves, who were starved and whipped and raped, who were ripped from their husbands and wives and from their children\u2014many of whom died during the treacherous journey, their bones their only song now at the bottom of dead seas made holy now by their gleam\u2014were immigrants? They were enslaved, Ben. They were worked, often, to death, for nothing. That\u2019s call slavery, Ben. It went on for four centuries. Ben, did you know they were in chains? Ben, what immigrants be in chains? Ben, you sound so stupid, but unfortunately, you are not merely stupid. If you were merely stupid, this would not cause us such outrage. Ben, we knew a while ago that you had become\u2026different. Conservative. Ignorant. Bigoted. You didn\u2019t look or talk like the Ben who was once ours\u2014the way the Temptations are ours, the way Barack and Michelle are ours, the way Anita Baker is ours, the way Maxine Waters is ours, the way gospel and the blues are ours. But we weren\u2019t enough for you. Our love wasn\u2019t good enough for you, and neither was self-love. Even the best Uncle Toms can be said to have been bought. Oh, Ben. I do not believe anyone bought your soul; I believe you just gave it away. And you can\u2019t stand yourself no more. I might\u2019ve felt bad enough to weep for you, except you chose this.\n\nI don\u2019t know where your hands have been, even though I know what they used to be: beautiful, brilliant hands, soft as an angel\u2019s wing, doing God\u2019s mighty work. Ben, you think you doing God\u2019s work now? You ain\u2019t. No one loves you enough to tell you because everyone in your circle is still clinging to the Ben Carson you used to be in hopes that, maybe, you could return. But I sense no one is holding their breath on that. Your new, white friends must love all that you have become: a lonesome shell that is either silent or, when he speaks, deadly.\n\nThough I believe you are gone, gone, gone, I got to at least tell you about yourself. Ben, how many Black boys and girls wanted to be doctors and surgeons because of you? But look what you did yesterday: you made racist white people\u2014and even non-racist white people\u2014get off for slavery. Yeah, you did that. I know it can\u2019t sting you just right because you deadened yourself a while back. Nevertheless. You made them believe we wanted that torture and terror. Ben, do you realize you made them believe it was okay to steal us from our first homes? That somehow, slavery was part of our striving? Ben, do you know you told them we wanted that? That we believe it was all worth it for the American Dream, which for many of us, remains a trick? Ben, your hands dirty. They ain\u2019t just dirty, though, Ben. Your hands bloody. Your hands bloody with Black blood. You put bodies on those ships yesterday. You put chains on little children. You said \u201cimmigrants\u201d as if we chose. As if that could even be possible. If you were only stupid, Ben. But no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you have chosen to be comatose because they were jealous and couldn\u2019t take your Black genius, how you understood the brain\u2014back then\u2014 the way Morrison understands language or the way Miles knew his horn. Ben, you are probably struggling with whom I mean when I say they. I mean white people. I see you shaking your head at that Ben, but they were lesser than you because they couldn\u2019t stand all the genius you were. They hated the way your mind outmaneuvered theirs. Oh, Ben. I can only imagine the landmines of micro and macro aggressions you withstood, on the regular. You were a beautiful brown tree, and they were a hurricane. A fist formed to pound you. I can only imagine the word \u201cnigger\u201d on repeat and all the countless, creative ways they called you that, day in and day out. After all, their greatest creativity is their brutality. The more creative your genius became, the more they reviled you. The more rootless you felt. You let it sink into the bone, how much they hated you. You let them wear you out. Their whiteness haunted you. Their whiteness said you ain\u2019t shit, and you believed them because you wanted their love.\n\nWhy was our love not enough? Did we not hold you up? Did we not whisper your name at Sunday dinners? Did we not pray for God to keep working through your hands? Did we not know your name like we know Dr. King\u2019s? Oh, Ben. Our love is the best love, baby. It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t know that when it mattered, back when your soul was in its place, back when your heart beat on time. Your hands used to do magic work. Oh, Lord, your beautiful hands! Now they don\u2019t have no witness to speak of. They just fold in your lap. I can almost hear them: Well, Lord. We tried.\n\nBen\u2026what happened to Ben Carson?\n\nI know he gone. But do you know where you put him? Did you drown him where they drowned Emmett? Was he shot in his driveway like Medgar? Was he bombed on Christmas Eve? Did you lock him in a cell and throw away the key? Did you cut out his tongue when you took away his heart and his soul? Can you count the lives you touched? Then broke? Does Ben know that number?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, you don\u2019t even dream anymore.\n\nBen, I have always believed Baby Suggs, holy, of Morrison\u2019s Beloved when she said, \u201cThere is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks. They don\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d Then she died. I thought that was the end-all. But you have bested even her. There ain\u2019t no bad luck in the world, I offer as revision, but a Black man who hates himself. Because that man can do no good. All he can do is make the folks who once loved him wonder if it was a phantom all that time. You made the descendants of the so-called masters feel like they were doing us a favor. Four hundred years of \u201cgood looking out.\u201d Oh, Ben. How you disappoint.\n\nYou need to know you should stop talking. I believe silence is golden right now while you go out there and find your real tongue\u2014the tongue that used to raise people from what would have been a certain death without first your tongue declaring what you were about to do, then your hands doing that magic on operating tables. Lord, how you used to shine in that operating room. How you used to shine everywhere. Don\u2019t you miss your shine? Do you remember how it felt to glow? Naw. I don\u2019t imagine you do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen, I can\u2019t stand you no more or the sound of your voice. I remember who you were, though. Part of why we\u2019re out here dragging you for life is not just because you deserve it, but because your mouth is an open wound, and you hurt us with your lies yesterday. We bear the memory of what you used to mean to us. Once, I would have loved to introduce my son to you. That time has passed. I\u2019d believe you might have a chance to come back if it wasn\u2019t for your eyes. They are such lifeless, dead things.\n\nYou still got breath, from what it looks like. You have to have breath to be talking, even though you should stop. Can you use your breath as a starting point? I\u2019d hoped you might\u2019ve left your soul someplace where you can go back for it. But yesterday, you snatched pretty much all hope of that. Still and all. I write to you. Maybe something inside of you is still alive. You owe us an apology, you sad, sad shell of what used to be a man worthy of our esteem, our respect, our devotion, and our love. Now, all we got for you is shade. And scorch. Even if you uttered sorry, all we would hear is lifeless noise. So. Keep it.\n\nBut this:\n\nBen, put your eyes back in. See what you did to yourself. Amidst a sea of brown love that washed over you, back then, as a prayer, you waded out into deep water and went under. Now you work for a spoiled, hateful, incompetent soul. You salute to him. Those splinters in your feet are from the pedestal we put you on, that you shattered. Oh. How you bleed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI leave you, bewildered but not surprised.\n\nTameka Cage Conley, PhD is a literary artist who writes poetry, fiction, plays, and essays.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["lives", "korryn", "baltimore", "mothers", "right", "wont", "speaks", "theres", "hes", "family", "rest", "situation", "child", "mother", "pain", "gaines", "dormeus"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

The story opens with a particularly horrific anecdote in which Ussery allegedly told a newly hired support staffer that she was going to \u201cget gangbanged.\u201d\n\nUssery, who left the team in 2015, denied the allegations, telling SI:\n\nDuring my nearly 20-year tenure with the Mavericks, I am not aware of any sexual harassment complaints about me or any findings by the organization that I engaged in inappropriate conduct. In fact, on multiple occasions I and other senior executives at the organization raised concerns\u2014both in person and in emails\u2014about other Mavericks employees who had engaged in highly inappropriate\u2014and in some cases, threatening\u2014sexual conduct. The organization refused to address these concerns, and I believe these misleading claims about me are part of an attempt to shift blame for the failure to remove employees who created an uncomfortable and hostile work environment within the Mavericks organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the SI report says that Ussery was part of a larger corporate culture that created a toxic stew of misogyny, sexual harassment and predatory sexual behavior. Even when women reported the harassment, they were either ignored or met with intimidating responses. Six female former employees of the Mavericks or the American Airlines Center (where the Mavs play) told SI that they left the sports sector altogether because of their experiences in the workplace there.\n\n\n\nThe Mavs released a statement before the release of the SI report that reads in part:\n\n\n\nIt has been alleged that a former officer of the organization engaged in various acts of inappropriate conduct toward women over a period of years. This individual left the employment of the Mavericks nearly three years ago and the Mavericks have only learned of the scope of these complaints in the past days. ... The Mavericks organization takes these allegations extremely seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeam owner Mark Cuban says that he is \u201cembarrassed\u201d about the accusations and vows to fix the problem; he told SI that the team has set up a counseling hotline for current and former employees and has ordered sensitivity training for the entire organization.\n\nNone of the Mavericks players were involved in any alleged misconduct. One female former senior staffer told the magazine: \u201cI dealt with players all the time.

The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people.

Recently launched by Oronike Odeleye and Kenyette Barnes, the campaign\u2019s intent is to finally shove R. Kelly out of the music industry because of a long history of abuse, from past allegations of pedophilia, sexual assault, and battery to newer, equally disturbing accusations of violence. Williams herself has long reported on R. Kelly\u2019s misdeeds throughout the years and has never shied away from expressing her disdain of the singer, so one would assume she would align with such a crusade.\n\nHowever, when the campaign was discussed during her Hot Topics segment, Williams was rather dismissive. \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late?\u201d Williams told the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a fan of the show, I have learned to build a high tolerance for opinions that ought to be soaked in bleach and left to air-dry near a Google search bar. Amnesia about recent political movements like Black Lives Matter notwithstanding, #MuteRKelly can already claim success after reportedly inspiring the cancellation of six of Kelly\u2019s concerts in eight cities. As #MeToo creator Tarana Burke explained on a recent episode of Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition with Jordan Keppler about Kelly: \u201cJust like the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, he\u2019s a sexual predator, and he\u2019s been preying on black and brown girls for 20 years.\u201d\n\nMany of R. Kelly\u2019s detractors have complained year after year about his continued success and adulation in the face of such history\u2014largely because of the type of victims he\u2019s chosen, but also because of the times in which he\u2019s lived. In just a few months, the world has changed: We are a far cry from the days when R. Kelly could marry a teenage Aaliyah without a public fuss. #MuteRKelly is an attempt to right these wrongs.\n\nIt is black women doing that we all should be doing. So it should not be undermined by, of all people, another black woman. And Williams is not the only famous black woman still excusing him\u2014or even publicly exalting him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are not one, but three photos currently on Lil\u2019 Kim\u2019s Instagram account of her in the studio with R. Kelly. She appears giddy, but many of her fans are rightfully frustrated. \u201cHe\u2019s a pedophile. How could anyone work with him?\u201d one user asks. Another writes, \u201cWait are we gonna forget that he pissed on a underaged girl? Wait what??\u201d\n\nOn the final date of their sold out arena tour, Xscape brought R. Kelly out on stage. Several members have daughters, and on a recent episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Kandi Burruss took part in an anti-domestic violence PSA organized by her co-star Kenya Moore. Why shoot that and then allow this shit to happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Jhen\u00e9 Aiko while we\u2019re at it. She has a duet with R. Kelly (2015's \u201cLet\u2019s Make Some Noise\u201d) and appears alongside Kelly on a recent Chris Brown track called \u201cJuicy Booty.\u201d I think of tranquility and good weed when I think of her, not complicity.\n\nLast year, I wrote about how sexism and racism within the music industry might compel some black female singers to join an R. Kelly tour bill. It remains a pity that a man like R. Kelly can continue to enjoy sizable support despite decades of being accused of sexual predatory behavior while talented women with less tawdry histories have to defer to and depend on him for visibility and money.\n\nThat was never an excuse for anyone who makes such a choice, but Lil\u2019 Kim and Xscape are far less vulnerable than those singers. Xscape had an all-female bill and sold out arenas across the country despite not having released an album in nearly 20 years. They made a willful choice to put that man on stage. It was the wrong one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for Lil\u2019 Kim. She is not far removed from the well-received Bad Boy Reunion Tour; has the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 dressing up as her for Halloween; has Remy Ma sampling her old hits to get radio airplay in this decade; and continues to enjoy a dedicated fan base that will pay to see her no matter the venue. And as a legend widely revered by artists of all genres, there are many people Lil\u2019 Kim could call for studio time. So it is a pity that she hasn\u2019t blocked R. Kelly\u2019s number already.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised when the likes of Chris Brown continue to work with R. Kelly, but I am perplexed when Xscape and Lil\u2019 Kim and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko still do. I\u2019ve long questioned men who support other men accused of predatory behavior, but evidently, there are women whose choices warrant similar inquiries.\n\nI don\u2019t care how much folks enjoy 12 Play and The Chocolate Factory. In 2018, it\u2019s fuck R. Kelly forever. I don\u2019t know if we can ever truly rid ourselves of Pissy considering we exist in a celebrity-driven news market with an insatiable craving for content, but there is certainly a way to minimize R. Kelly as much as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can stop inviting him to award shows. We can stop playing him on the radio. We can stop allowing him to be booked in big arenas; we can let his peeing ass perform in some miserable somebody\u2019s backyard or preferred circle of hell instead. We can stop allowing him space on our sold-out arena tours. We can cut those studio sessions out of the budget. We can stop doing any single thing that allows him to keep thinking he\u2019s invincible and above reproach.\n\nEveryone who cares about black women and girls, consent, and autonomy should be down for that cause.

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money.

The footage captures the incident unfolding as the officers execute a U-turn on Fair Oaks inside Altadena and head south after the white Mercedes driven by Ballew, which turns into the Mobile gas station. The officers follow Ballew, pull up behind him, and one approaches him as [he] heads towards the station\u2019s cashier.

As one officer tells Ballew [he] \u201cbetter stop acting like a dummy, dude,\u201d the two officers begin to struggle to handcuff Ballew, who ends up on the pavement up against the passenger side of the Mercedes. The officers order Ballew to give them his hands. It does not appear that he complies. Ballew repeatedly asks, \u201cWhere is your commanding officer?\u201d and manages to pull away from the officers with dangling handcuffs clamped around one wrist. One officer begins to strike Ballew with his baton. Ballew grabs the baton and pulls it away from the officer. That officer draws his service weapon and aims it towards Ballew. His partner is apparently in the line of fire. The officer holsters his weapon and retrieves the baton, now lying on the pavement. The officer delivers three \u201ccompliance strikes\u201d to Ballew with the baton, one to his back and two in the area of his ankles, as his partner punches Ballew, knocks Ballew to the ground and pushes Ballew\u2019s head onto the pavement.

Dean Graziolli, who was working security at the Corner Alley bowling alley and bar.\n\nYatsko\u2019s mother, Melissa, was shocked when she discovered what had happened to her son. She said that no one had contacted her about her son until news reporters began calling her Tuesday morning.\n\nShe didn\u2019t think it unusual that he hadn\u2019t come home, since Thomas often spent time at his girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.\n\nCleveland police spokesperson Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said that officers tried to contact Thomas\u2019 father, who does not live with Melissa Yatsko, several times. Officers even apparently left a note on the father\u2019s home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to police, the situation started around 11 p.m. Saturday when Thomas Yatsko reportedly got into a fight. The brawlers, including Yatsko, were kicked out of the bar.\n\nPolice say that Yatsko then returned and attacked Graziolli, who pulled out his gun and fired the fatal shots. A witness told the news site that he heard two gunshots.\n\nOne witness called 911 from the bar, telling dispatchers that she saw Yatsko and a friend fighting before they were both kicked out. Graziolli was the one who escorted them out of the bar. One of the two friends who were kicked out told the officer to \u201cleave him alone\u201d because he was cooperating, the witness told the dispatcher, according to Cleveland.com.\n\nThe caller noted that the off-duty officer then got into a fight with a customer before shooting him. The woman said that Yatsko was awake after the shooting and breathing but was bleeding heavily. Nurses at the bar tried to help him and get the bleeding to stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet another caller told the dispatcher that Graziolli never tried to use his stun gun or an alternative method during the apparent fight. Officials have not confirmed whether Graziolli tried to use lesser force before firing his weapon.\n\nCiaccia did confirm, however, that a preliminary investigation into the incident showed that Yatsko was unarmed. The Cuyahoga County Sheriff\u2019s Department is now investigating the shooting.\n\nGraziolli\u2019s union said that the officer suffered injuries, including cuts and bruises to his head, face and body, during the altercation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sergeant is currently on administrative leave and has been placed on light duty in the department\u2019s gym until the Sheriff\u2019s Department finishes its investigation.\n\nIn the meantime, Yatsko\u2019s family and community are left to remember a young man who enjoyed helping people and putting smiles on their faces.\n\nDuring the most recent winter storm, he made it a point to go around shoveling his neighbor\u2019s driveways and helping the homeless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com, a few days ago Yatsko, who was working full time at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, noticed a homeless man counting pennies just trying to buy a single doughnut. The man came up short, but Thomas gave him six doughnuts, free of charge.\n\n\u201cHe always would do that for people who didn\u2019t have money,\u201d his mother said. \u201cHe told me that day, \u2018These people come in and they\u2019re so miserable, and I just want to make them smile.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegular customers would often ask for him by name, Michelle Yatsko added.\n\nHe had stopped working at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts to take a job at PCC Airfoil in Mentor, Ohio, inspecting metal used to make industrial gas turbines, but after his car broke down and he couldn\u2019t make the commute, he returned to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPCC promised him that his job would be waiting for him if he got his transport organized.\n\n\u201cThey loved him there,\u201d she said.\n\nHe was also a great role model and father figure to his two younger brothers, 17-year-old Anthony and 16-year-old Tyler, encouraging them to go to college, the site notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was a good mentor,\u201d Anthony said of his brother. \u201cHe was hard on us.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing. Sing until you can\u2019t sing no more.\n\nWe need to flush the toilet on this administration and power-wash the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way to do that is to get everyone out first.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["pleaded", "lying", "pence", "trump", "pleading", "statement", "releases", "times", "james", "subtweet", "flynn", "sing", "russian", "responds", "guilty", "michael", "charges"], "polarity": 0.015477855477855481, "subjectivity": 0.45993839493839483},

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention. She also made sure that The Opposition\u2019s audience left knowing that #MeToo is far more than a hashtag:\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement is here to stay,\u201d said Burke.", "keywords": ["mission", "metoo", "tarana", "keeps", "sexual", "focused", "person", "power", "klepper", "burke", "knowing", "harassment", "sisters", "movement", "keeper"], "polarity": 0.14142149003260113, "subjectivity": 0.49962408990186763},

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

Pompeo would be a troubling choice as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. His hawkish views on Islam are more likely to enable Trump\u2019s Muslim-hating rhetoric, not suppress it.\n\nAs The Atlantic notes, Pompeo has close ties with Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy, who has argued that following Islamic law is \u201can impermissible act of sedition, which has to be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, Pompeo would make a perfect fit for Trump because they are both warmongers. A fierce opponent of the Iran deal, Pompeo said in 2014, while a member of the House of Representatives from Kansas, that military force should be used to halt Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nAs disastrous as Tillerson has been, he at least was a voice of calm in quelling the calls for war coming out of the Oval Office. He consistently pushed back against calls for military action in North Korea, saying that diplomacy should be prioritized. Unlike Trump, he supports the Iran deal and is reportedly working behind the scenes to save it. During a hearing on the Hill, Tillerson said that classifying the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group would complicate peace negotiations in the Middle East.\n\nTillerson\u2019s rhetoric toward Islam is not remotely as inflammatory as Trump\u2019s, and he seems to always be the voice of relative reason in an otherwise xenophobic administration. By comparison, Pompeo has spoken at the Act for America conference (the Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed the organization an anti-Muslim hate group). In 2015 he wrote an op-ed in the Kansas City Star arguing against the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility (and, by the way, Pompeo is a fan of waterboarding, a form of torture). As member of the House Intelligence Committee, Pompeo told Congress in 2013 that Muslim leaders who do not condemn terrorist attacks are \u201cpotentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPompeo basically took the actions of a few and equated them to all Muslims, just like his boss Trump, whose first order of business as president was signing a travel ban for people from certain Muslim countries and who, just last week, retweeted anti-Muslim videos from an Islamophobic political party in the United Kingdom.\n\nA secretary of state is, in fact, a mouthpiece for the president\u2019s foreign policy, but he or she is also supposed to find ways to avoid conflict. Pompeo\u2019s very public anti-Muslim stances make it clear that he is predisposed to seeing Muslims as violent simply because they are Muslim.\n\nMoreover, Pompeo is a pretty awful CIA director who has been accused of being more of an ideologue than a professional intelligence gatherer. When asked if Trump\u2019s Twitter activity makes his job harder during a Q&A Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif., Pompeo said that it actually made his job easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have seen things the president has put on his Twitter account actually have a real-world impact on our capacity to understand what\u2019s going on in other places of the world,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cOur adversaries responded to those tweets in ways that were helpful to us to understand command and control issues, who\u2019s listening to what messages, how those messages are resonating around the world.\u201d\n\nThis man may be our next secretary of state, folks.\n\nIndeed, America has a very destructive history in the Middle East. But Trump\u2019s open hatred for Islam and willingness to appoint as his top diplomat someone who shares those views is arguably a game changer. Pompeo as America\u2019s top diplomat will signal to the world that Trump\u2019s Islamophobia is official U.S. diplomatic policy, a message that far-right extremists the globe over will hail in victory.", "keywords": ["state", "tillerson", "rhetoric", "secretary", "trumps", "antimuslim", "islam", "muslim", "president", "worse", "pompeo", "mike", "trump", "policy"], "polarity": 0.008089410589410576, "subjectivity": 0.3846112221112221},

My name is Lawrence Ross, and if there\u2019s one thing you should know about me, it\u2019s that I love black people. Yeah, I know people like to say that, but I truly do. I\u2019m fascinated by who we are, where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re going. And over the past 20 years, I\u2019ve written six books about the black experience, including the Los Angeles Times best-seller The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities and my latest joint, Blackballed: The Black and White Politics of America\u2019s Campuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, I\u2019ve lectured at over 700 colleges and universities, traveling the highways and byways of this country endless times. But there was one project I always wanted to do. What if you drove cross-country as intentionally black as possible? Meaning that you stayed at black-owned hotels, bought gas at black-owned stations and ate at black-owned restaurants whenever possible? And what if you did that while also exploring an earlier, more dangerous time, when traveling while black could be a life-or-death proposition? Well, from June 12 to 18, I\u2019m going to do just that.\n\n#TheRootTrip\n\nWelcome to #TheRootTrip, the blackest cross-country road trip since Spike Lee\u2019s Get on the Bus. The blackity blackest since Janet got in Tupac\u2019s postal truck and hit a random cookout in Poetic Justice. You get the idea. Well, here\u2019s how this trip is going to work.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeginning this Monday, I\u2019m driving 3,000 miles from my hometown of Los Angeles to the tobacco farm where Booker T. Washington was enslaved in Roanoke, Va., and I\u2019m going to try to buy black as much as possible. Besides gas, lodging and food, I\u2019m going to seek out things like a good black-owned car wash, or a place to get a refreshing massage. Hell, this trip is so black, I might find a place to get my scalp oiled. I want you to learn about both ordinary and unique black businesses, while also noting where black-owned services don\u2019t exist.\n\nBut this trip also has another twist. We\u2019re also going black in time, and that means pulling out The Negro Motorist Green Book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Negro Motorist Green Book\n\nThe Negro Motorist Green Book was an annual travel book produced by Victor Green beginning in 1936 and ending in the late 1960s. (Green changed the name to The Negro Travelers\u2019 Green Book in 1952 to acknowledge the inclusion of some international spots reached by plane or ship.) It was created as a way to help black travelers find safe and welcoming lodging, restaurants and private homes during Jim Crow segregation. Traveling while black during segregation could be a life-or-death proposition, and the guidebook helped mitigate some, but not all, of that risk. On #TheRootTrip, I wanted to see what happened to some of the businesses listed in the guide. And since my mother traveled with her family from Dallas to Los Angeles in 1957, that\u2019s the year I chose.\n\nSo whenever I reach a city, I\u2019m going to randomly pick an address from the guide and drive to it. I have no idea what I\u2019ll find, since it\u2019s a bit of a treasure hunt, but hopefully we\u2019ll learn something about who we were yesterday and where we are today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow Lawrence!\n\nThe fun part of #TheRootTrip is that you can follow along in real time. Every day I\u2019m going to post dispatches from #TheRootTrip to The Root, sharing my experience in each city and town. So check back often.

What happened next is still up for debate.\n\nThe LAPD says that the man resisted, fought with the cops and eventually tried to grab an officer\u2019s gun. The man\u2019s family says that he was unarmed and suffering from mental illness and was a victim of police brutality. A bystander\u2019s video showed officers manhandling, punching and choking the Cameroonian man. There is only one thing that every party agrees on:\n\nAn officer of the LAPD shot and killed Charly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang.\n\nIt seems like it would be an easy thing to clear up. At least three officers on the scene were outfitted with body cameras that captured the incident. But for three years the city of Los Angeles refused to release the footage, until the Los Angeles Times, after a lengthy court battle, obtained the videos from those bodycams on Tuesday.\n\nThe videos show Keunang standing in front of his tent arguing with policemen as Francisco Martinez, an officer who Skid Row residents called a \u201chard-ass bitch cop,\u201d threatens to shoot Keunang with a Taser. Keunang goes back inside his tent and tells the officers to \u201cleave me alone.\u201d As Keunang exits his tent again, the video shows Martinez tasing him. At least three officers pounce on him. You can hear and see another cop, Daniel Torres, using his Taser directly against Charly\u2019s body as the officers yell, \u201cStop resisting!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartinez\u2019s partner, Joshua Volasgis, punches Keunang \u201ctwo, three times in the facial area,\u201d he tells investigators, according to Jeff Sharlet of GQ magazine, who reviewed the footage and the police reports.\n\nKeunang is caught in the wire from two Tasers. He is being shocked repeatedly. He is being punched. He begins spinning wildly. Volasgis shouts: \u201cHe has my gun! He has my gun!\u201d\n\nThen an officer raises his gun and shoots Charly Keunang.\n\nThe officers look for Volasgis\u2019 gun in Charly\u2019s hand, but it is not in Charly\u2019s hand. It is not on the ground. It is not in the tent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gun is still in Volasgis\u2019 holster.\n\nThe LAPD released an \u201cenhanced image\u201d from another officer\u2019s camera that supposedly shows Keunang grabbing an officer\u2019s weapon, although the family\u2019s attorneys say that they cannot see it. Eleven months later, a closed-door hearing conducted by the Los Angeles Police Commission would reach the same conclusion: that Keunang died after grabbing a policeman\u2019s weapon. City prosecutors would never file charges against the officers.\n\nCharly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang is dead.\n\nStill.\n\nHe would be approximately the 175th person shot and killed by police in 2015, according to GQ magazine. Police would shoot and kill 820 more people that year; 259 of them would be black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey would kill 963 in 2016.\n\nThey would kill 987 in 2017.\n\nThere will be more this year.\n\nRead more at the Los Angeles Times.", "keywords": ["gun", "angeles", "officer", "los", "homeless", "officers", "shooting", "keeping", "volasgis", "lapd", "releases", "secret", "man", "keunang", "times", "tent", "video", "cops", "unarmed"], "polarity": -0.014221014492753625, "subjectivity": 0.34456521739130436},

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["gop", "republican", "hawks", "fake", "ukraine", "trumps", "weak", "obama", "president", "russian", "making", "look", "trump", "russias", "russia"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money. With another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, nothing has been done, and all of this comes on the heels of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s warning that Russia was already looking to interfere in the 2018 midterms.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s their intention to interfere, they\u2019re going to find ways to do that,\u201d Tillerson told Fox News last month. \u201cAnd we can take steps we can take, but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it, it\u2019s very difficult to pre-empt it.\u201d\n\nOh, Mr. Tillerson, I have an idea of how we can attempt to pre-empt Russian interference.

Tom Cotton, the goofy, Trump-loving Arkansas Republican who would hold the president\u2019s nut sack if asked nicely, would most likely be expected to take over the reins at the CIA.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about Tillerson\u2019s potential dismissal, CNN reports that Trump offered, \u201cHe\u2019s here, Rex is here,\u201d which we all know in Trump-speak means, he\u2019s here today, but I can\u2019t guarantee that he\u2019ll be here tomorrow.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah \u201cSuckabee\u201d Sanders echoed the president\u2019s position. Seriously, she literally repeated the exact phrase, \u201cRex is here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe did add, in a statement viewed by CNN, \u201cSecretary Tillerson continues to lead the State Department and the entire Cabinet is focused on completing this incredibly successful first year of President Trump\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\n\n\nI expect the president to break something in the Oval Office because he\u2019s upset that he can\u2019t stop leaks from coming out of the White House, but Tillerson is done. In fact, the only thing prolonging his exit is the fact that the press got wind of it early, and there is one thing the president can\u2019t stand, and that\u2019s being upstaged.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Tillerson once reportedly called Trump a \u201cmoron,\u201d and we all know that\u2019s all it takes for President Petty to cast you out of the kingdom (Mama Dee voice).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["white", "state", "banana", "tillerson", "house", "secretary", "hes", "peel", "rex", "president", "cnn", "trump", "foot"], "polarity": 0.14506172839506173, "subjectivity": 0.5046296296296297},

Isaiah Washington, an actor best known for his role as Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden in the Joe Torre biopic, Joe Torre: Curveballs Along the Way, tweeted that Rock needs to adapt to profiling, even mentioning that once he stopped driving a Benz and started driving a Prius, he received much less attention from the police.\n\nPredictably, Washington's comments didn't go over very well. But, I do think there was a lot of truth in what Washington was saying. My only gripe was that he didn't go far enough. Following Washington's lead, here are a few tips to remember if you're Chris Rock or any other Black person and you happen to be driving and you don't want to get profiled.\n\n1. Don't be Black\n\nThis is crucial. Nothing else on this list is as important as this detail. If you are a Black person and you happen to be driving and you don't want to get racially profiled by the police, you need to do everything possible to just not be a Black person.\n\n2. Be White\n\nIf you're able to not be Black, it will definitely help your chances if you can somehow find a way to just be White.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you suspect you might be Black before you get behind the wheel, find a way to not be Black before you get behind the wheel\n\nRoughly 100% of driving while Black cases involve Black people who willingly got behind the wheel of a car despite knowing very well that they were Black. If this is you, and you're thinking about driving, you need to find a way to not be Black before you start driving.\n\n4. If you suspect you might be Black and you're already behind the wheel, pull over, put the car in park, take the key out of the ignition, and then do what you can to not be Black before you resume driving\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote: It's crucial to make sure you're not Black anymore before you get back behind the wheel. Do not cut corners here.\n\n5. Make sure your mirrors are functional and well-lit\n\nBecause, let's say you tried to not be Black, assumed you were successful, but actually failed. How else would you know you're actually still Black if not for several functional and well-lit mirrors?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. If you do happen to see a police car in your rearview mirror, don't panic\n\nWhy? Well, it's not too late. Perhaps the officer has seen your car, but he hasn't yet realized you're Black. Police officers are people, remember? They don't have superhuman vision. Anyway, if the officer hasn't yet realized you're Black, you still have time to not be Black.\n\n7. If you do happen to get followed and stopped, again, don't panic.\n\nWhy? Well, as crazy as this sounds, between the time the officer stops you because he thinks you might be Black and approaches your car, you still have time to not be Black. You'll have to move quickly, but if you can manage to not be Black in those 15 to 35 seconds, the officer will see that he's made a mistake, and might even escort you to your destination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. If you are Black and you need to get somewhere and you're finding it difficult to not be Black, find the nearest White person, tell him about your predicament, offer him some cash to drive you somewhere, hop in the trunk, and instruct him to let you out of your trunk when you get to your destination\n\nThis is why it's always good to keep at least two or three White people around on retainer. Because having an available White guy around is like having a gun. You'd rather have one and not need one than need one and not have one.\n\n9. Be a ghost\n\nIf you do happen to be driving and you're finding it just too damn difficult to be White on such short notice, try being a member of the undead that still walks the planet and exists in shadows. Although some cops might follow, pull over, and arrest you anyway, most will be so spooked that an apparition is driving a car they'll probably just let you go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Please note, however, that being a Black ghost won't work either.)\n\n10. If you do happen to get stopped, and you're not able to be White or an undead ghost, call an Uber\n\nAnd, when the police officer approaches you, just tell him that you have T-Mobile, and you wanted to call an Uber from home, but you can only get a good cell reception in your car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe'll understand.", "keywords": ["white", "officer", "happen", "wheel", "car", "prevent", "black", "profiled", "getting", "dont", "need", "ways", "youre", "driving"], "polarity": -0.037703252032520305, "subjectivity": 0.4709688346883468},

They killed more citizens than airplanes (13 deaths worldwide), mass shooters (428 deaths) and Chicago\u2019s \u201ctop gang thugs\u201d (675 Chicago homicides).\n\nYet only 12 officers were charged with a crime related to a shooting death.\n\nAn extensive new study from Mapping Police Violence details the data for police violence. The collective tracks police shooting numbers and statistics, maps the incidents and compiles the data in real time. The site uses information from a number of sources, including Killed by Police, Fatal Encounters and the U.S. Police Shootings Database, to break down shootings by race, location, weapons used, and whether or not the victim was armed.

Twelve had previously shot or killed multiple people.\n\nMost of the people killed (718) were suspects in nonviolent offenses, were stopped for traffic violations or had committed no crime at all.\n\n13 percent of people killed by cops were unarmed.\n\nMost of the unarmed victims were people of color. Of the 147 unarmed people killed by police, 48 were black and 34 were Hispanic.\n\nBlack people accounted for 27 percent of the people killed by law enforcement officers. Of the unarmed victims of police violence, blacks made up 37 percent, almost three times their percentage of the U.S. population (13 percent).\n\nOf the people who were unarmed and not attacking, but were still killed by cops, 35 percent were black.\n\n95 people were killed when police shot at a moving vehicle, a practice that many say should be banned.\n\n170 of the people killed were armed with a knife. in 117 of those incidents, police shot the person before trying any other method to disarm the person.\n\n20 percent of the people who had a gun when they were killed were not threatening anyone.\n\nLaw enforcement training spends seven times more hours training officers on the use of firearms than on how to de-escalate situations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, only 12 officers were charged with a crime after killing 1,129 citizens they were sworn to protect and serve.

The announcements came after many users, including The Root\u2019s Monique Judge, raised hell when Twitter gave a blue check mark to Jason Kessler, a white nationalist who helped plan the pro-Confederacy march in August in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\n\nWhile Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and his workers ruminated on the company\u2019s account-verification policies, I decided it was a good time for black people to pause and think about our relationship with Twitter and other social media and technology companies. We voluntarily \u201ccontribute\u201d our creative insights, dollars and labor to the success of these companies by buying devices and apps, uploading memes, ideas and language that trend widely. Yet in terms of the vast wealth these companies hold, disburse to employees and generate for shareholders, we get little in return.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of the recent moment when top lawyers for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, along with Twitter and Facebook, were summoned to Capitol Hill to testify before Senate and House committees looking into the company\u2019s role in disseminating toxic content and ads during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nI shared the congressional investigators\u2019 agita\u2014and the pointed through line of their questioning: How did we get to the point where tech seems to be drowning American democracy? How could the educated, experienced \u201ctechnologists\u201d who built and run these companies have missed the Russians\u2019 insidious gaming of their platforms?\n\nI think there\u2019s one big reason among several that led to the companies\u2019 obliviousness: The tech industry is nearly wholly centered in an exclusionary bubble of white men who finance, develop and market the platforms and applications. The same biases that led to the development of social media startups built on algorithms that enable racial profiling (like NextDoor), or that inform court decisions resulting in blacks and Latinos receiving unduly harsh sentences (like COMPAS), played a role in the Russians\u2019 stealthy misinformation campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnti-black messaging was the secret sauce of many of the pro-Trump, nationalist memes and messages that flooded through the popular social media channels during the 2016 election cycle. Yet somehow, the gatekeepers at Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t seem to notice the methodical manipulation of racial animus that already exists in America\u2014specifically, some white Americans\u2019 negative opinions of blacks.\n\nThe leaders and staffs of Twitter, Facebook and other popular social media platforms missed the Russians\u2019 exploitation of the black-white divide, an obliviousness that has precedent: Black women who use Twitter had long alerted the platform\u2019s officials to the abusive conduct of other users, up to and including death threats. The hashtag #YourSlipIsShowing catalogs such experiences from black women dating back several years and is readily available ... at least to those interested in learning about and addressing these kinds of user experiences.\n\nBut clearly, the tech-company leaders were not inclined to pay attention to this area of user complaints, a strong indication that they also probably weren\u2019t interested in the views of the few black and Latinx workers at their companies, either. Just look at what happened to Leslie Miley, a black former engineer at Twitter. Miley revealed in a recent interview that he had flagged tons of dubious accounts in 2015, telling his bosses that he believed they were from Ukraine or Russia and that they appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley was told by his bosses at Twitter to \u201cstay in his lane,\u201d a response that Miley says he took as a sign that the company leadership preferred to err on the side of \u201cgrowth numbers\u201d rather than on any potential harm to audiences that the bots might pose.\n\nMeanwhile, black users of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Google products infuse them with a deep coolness factor that resonates around the world. Our intellectual property and creativity is the lifeboat that floats these companies to revenue solvency, yet few of us share in the enormous economic wealth generated by these companies, not even after dozens of news stories, industry conferences and activists\u2019 complaints forced the companies to pledge to improve hiring and retention.\n\n\n\nThe history of black-white tension in America was a major flashpoint manipulated by the GOP during the presidential campaign (not for the first time), and the Russia-controlled bots capitalized on whites\u2019 fears of and disdain for black Americans. This exploitation has been documented by federal investigators, as well as media, including Terrell J. Starr here at The Root and at other news outlets.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the owners, leaders and staffs at the tech companies did not seem to notice or care about the implications of the sneaky manipulation while it happened in real time. The incredible whiteness of their leaderships and staffs is akin to, but far worse than, that of the news industry (which is significant). And the companies\u2019 whiteness is a big reason they missed the infiltration of these divisive messages and tribal calls to action during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nBlack Americans know when something smells rotten, including the kinds of scams and shady b.s. that can unfold at one\u2019s job. And, as usual, blacks and other marginalized communities have solutions. We have the brainpower, problem-solving acumen and moral fortitude to right the ship of state.\n\nThe question is whether our concerns and advice will be heeded and whether we can achieve full access to the genuine levers of power in the United States, including access to quality education, health care, voting and, most importantly in the context of the innovation ecosystem, investment capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you regularly shout out Chance the Rapper or Ava via the \u2019gram, or post your hair-braiding tutorials on YouTube or Amazon.com commercial verticals and cash the resulting PayPal deposits accordingly, you are well within your rights to hold these companies accountable and question the political and economic structures that gave these companies ready access to us, their most valuable cultural assets. Our fixating on the blue check mark of verification should be the least of it.\n\n\n\nWhile there certainly are rough seas and shimmering mirages all around, I do see promise and opportunity in the amazing tech discoveries and innovations that enter the marketplace daily. I also see a future in which blacks and other historically marginalized creators and entrepreneurs more powerfully leverage their advantages in service of owning these technologies.\n\n\n\nRight now we\u2019re swimming in amazing discoveries, yet drowning in age-old belief systems and tribalism that effectively cancel out far-ranging benefits of the powerful machines that increasingly shape our experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is up to us see to it that tech is built and used to positively tell our stories, support our causes and policies, and shape our destinies.", "keywords": ["techs", "white", "twitter", "problem", "social", "users", "black", "including", "solution", "whiteness", "companies", "tech", "media", "facebook"], "polarity": 0.09615543186971759, "subjectivity": 0.40157366443080733},

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["muterkelly", "girls", "comes", "women", "metoo", "wendy", "wildin", "black", "young", "r", "kelly", "twisted", "assault", "sexual", "williams"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention. She also made sure that The Opposition\u2019s audience left knowing that #MeToo is far more than a hashtag:\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement is here to stay,\u201d said Burke.", "keywords": ["mission", "metoo", "tarana", "keeps", "sexual", "focused", "person", "power", "klepper", "burke", "knowing", "harassment", "sisters", "movement", "keeper"], "polarity": 0.14142149003260113, "subjectivity": 0.49962408990186763},

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

Blige after the 2018 Oscars, and apparently, my invitation was lost in the mail ... or maybe it was the huge snowstorm that hit the East Coast this weekend that caused the delay. It was a balmy 69 degrees where I live, but there must be a reason I didn\u2019t get an invite. Probably the Mueller investigation.\n\nAnyway, Us Weekly reports that Hov and Queen Bey turned the garage at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles into an old-school Hollywood glamour lounge for around 150 guests who were sworn to secrecy, which upsets me even more, because I\u2019ve always wanted to go to the Chateau Marmont.\n\nHonestly, I have no clue what the Chateau Marmont is, but had my invitation not been stolen by kids in the neighborhood, I could have found out. (Just so I won\u2019t get in trouble here, I think I might have dated Chateau Marmont Wilkins during my sophomore year in college, but those years are pretty fuzzy.)\n\nThe party was so secret, Mary J. Blige had to throw people off the scent. When asked on the red carpet if she was doing anything to celebrate her Oscar nomination, the R&B diva told Entertainment Tonight: \u201cThe fam is doing something big for us tonight. I feel really blessed to have people that care about me that much. I care about them that much, and it just feels really good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Page Six, the guests had to walk up a hill, go into a kitchen and enter a secret walkway that took them to the party. The guests didn\u2019t even know who was throwing the party, as the staff was told to refer to Jigga and Sasha Fierce only as \u201cthe host and hostess,\u201d which makes me feel better because If I was invited to a party by an anonymous stranger, I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t go.

They inadvertently cut off the part of the sentence that said \u201cexcept for Michael Harriot,\u201d but you know how \u201cthey\u201d do.\n\nNo press or photographers were invited, but a few pictures managed to leak, including this one of Dave Chapelle, Jordan Peele, Jay-Z, Kobe Bryant and Anthony Anderson:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am told that Dave Chapelle was whispering to Peele: \u201cHave you seen Mike Harriot? I know he\u2019s here somewhere. There\u2019s no way he wasn\u2019t invited!\u201d\n\nAlso, notice that the bar in the background is stocked with Jay\u2019s Armand de Brignac Champagne because you don\u2019t reach $800 million in net worth by passing up branding opportunities. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what he would have told me during our little private chat in the VIP section as Beyonc\u00e9 told me to come out to the house one weekend to see the kids, and I told her I was very busy this time of year but that I\u2019d try to make it out in the fall.\n\nThen she would have told me to bring Chateau out with me, and she would have looked all sad when I told her that Chateau and I broke up years ago. Then Bey would have reached out to rub me on my shoulders, looked wistfully into my eyes and said: \u201cI thought you two were going to make it. I really did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCelebrities like Stevie Wonder, Rihanna, Danai Gurira, Drake and Jamie Foxx were all left wondering where Michael Harriot was as I eschewed expensive Champagne for a plastic Solo cup filled from my refrigerator\u2019s water dispenser before going to bed at the Chateau Harri\u00f3t.\n\nBut the word is that this will become an annual event for the Carters, so I suspect I\u2019ll be there next year ...\n\nWeather permitting.", "keywords": ["know", "oscars", "guests", "jayz", "chateau", "harriot", "beyonc\u00e9", "weekend", "black", "secret", "dont", "sure", "invite", "party", "marmont", "im", "told", "threw", "meant", "really"], "polarity": 0.06304027113237641, "subjectivity": 0.5160380116959064},

Other evidence, including shell casings, witness statements and forensic analysis, indicated that Rialmo was apparently farther away from LeGrier when he fired than he initially said he was.\n\nAccording to the Tribune, LeGrier fell in the vestibule of the apartment building. Rialmo said that he fired from the building\u2019s front porch. However, it has since been determined that it was more likely that Rialmo fired from between the bottom of the porch and the sidewalk outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u201creasonable officer,\u201d the board concluded, would have had no reason to believe that he was in danger of death or serious injury.\n\nIt was not immediately made public what recommendations for punishment disciplinary authorities made, but the Tribune notes that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability usually recommends termination for officers involved in unjustified shootings. After that, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson will have three months to decide what form of discipline, if any, he will take.\n\nRialmo\u2019s attorney, of course, is paid to argue for his client, and he claimed that the agency\u2019s ruling cast the evidence in a misleading light, pointing out that LeGrier appeared to be suffering from a mental health crisis during the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI challenge anybody not to feel that their life was in danger in such a situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political decision, not one based on the evidence. ...

This week, Facebook revealed to our parent company, Fusion Media, that Russia-related content ran on two of our sites: Splinter (formerly Fusion) and here at The Root.\n\nEven though Russia is known for having some of the best hackers and bots in the world (I still don\u2019t know what a \u201cbot\u201d is. Is it a robot with an amputated leg? Is it a boy thot?), apparently the Soviet propaganda could only generate side eye from our readers. Even though The Root has 1.2 million followers on Facebook, only a small percentage of the Russian ads made impressions.\n\nFacebook defines \u201cimpressions\u201d as \u201cthe moment an ad enters the screen of a desktop browser or mobile app. If an ad doesn\u2019t enter the screen, we don\u2019t count it as an ad impression.\u201d I haven\u2019t verified the numbers, but I assume only a few thousand of our readers took the Kremlin-backed bait. Hold on, let me check.\n\nOK, I just messaged our social media editor Aarick Knighton. He said only three thousand ... wait. No, just three people? That can\u2019t be right. Let me double-check that figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, just three people saw the Russian ads. Three. That\u2019s it.\n\nWe all know how hard it is for advertisers to reach black audiences, especially when there are white people making the decisions (see SheaMoisture, Pepsi, Dove, et al.). We thought we\u2019d help Facebook, Russia and other advertisers who wanted to reach The Root\u2019s audience by sharing a few ideas that we know would attract attention.\n\n1. Beyonc\u00e9 or Rihanna\n\nIf Facebook ran an ad saying Beyonc\u00e9 was voting for Trump, I\u2019m sure the Beyhive vote would have been worth five or six electoral votes, minimum. Even better, if they had said that every person who pulled the lever for the cantaloupe-colored colluder got a Fenty gift bag, it would have been a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Wypipo\n\nContrary to popular belief, not all The Root\u2019s readers are black. Sometimes Caucasians click on our stories to shed their daily dose of white tears (I\u2019m pretty sure it is a weight-loss technique). And nothing gets the white tears flowing like the word \u201cwypipo.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re selling lotion or Confederate flags. If a headline contains the word, they will click on it.\n\nThen they\u2019ll write the company a letter about how racist their lotion is.\n\n3. Barack and Michelle Obama\n\nLet\u2019s try a quick experiment: Find a random black woman\u2019s Facebook page and scroll through her pictures. I guarantee one of them is a photo of Barack, Michelle or both Obamas. In fact, a 2016 Pew Research poll that was never conducted shows that 83.5 percent of black women\u2019s cellphones have a photograph of the Obamas, only slightly lower than the 94.2 percent who have an unsolicited picture of a penis in their \u201cdeleted photos\u201d folders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Black Lives Matter\n\nLike the word \u201cwypipo,\u201d Caucasians are compelled to click on anything that says #BlackLivesMatter just so they can comment, \u201cShouldn\u2019t all lives matter?\u201d\n\n5. Black Men in Gray Sweatpants\n\nApparently this is a thing women are into. I haven\u2019t done the research, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a big thing now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I think it\u2019s all about things.\n\n6. The Russian Pee Tape\n\nSell it online. I know I\u2019d probably throw up the sweet-and-sour chicken I ate yesterday if I laid eyes on Trump\u2019s bloated, pale, quince-shaped naked body dripping wet with Moscovian-prostitute urine, so I wouldn\u2019t watch it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just want to see the memes on Black Twitter.\n\n7. A Police Officer Convicted of Killing an Unarmed Black Person\n\nOr a unicorn. Or a high-resolution photo of Bigfoot. Or Donald Trump telling the truth. Or Kellyanne Conway combing her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean ... if you want to spread fake news, make it something good.\n\n8. Natural Hair Products\n\nBlack women would click on anything that moisturizes their 3c-grade hair and holds their curl pattern when it rains. I don\u2019t know what any of that means, but they do. Black hair products are proof that the U.S. excludes black women from STEM research because every woman is a Ph.D.-level chemist when it comes to her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9.

But only a brief year before, a judge had ruled against pop star Kesha in her own exhaustive sexual abuse trial in favor of Sony Music and her alleged abuser, producer Dr. Luke.\n\nIn this watershed moment, what would the music industry have to offer when its own moment of reckoning has so far seemed muted, at best? This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry. Their first initiative? An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage. During her introduction of what would be an emotional performance by Kesha, musician and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e gave a compelling speech, reminding the audience assembled at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden and abroad:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry. Artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. We come in peace, but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time\u2019s up. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, time\u2019s up for discrimination, time\u2019s up for harassment of any kind, and time\u2019s up for the abuse of power. Because you see, it\u2019s not just going on in Hollywood, it\u2019s not just going on in Washington; it\u2019s right here in our industry as well. And just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo a culture that does not serve us well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a Grammys moment well worth remembering, and \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business\u201d are words we won\u2019t be surprised to hear become a common phrase within the #TimesUp moment.\n\nWhile we\u2019re already ready to say it with our chests, in our fast-fashion culture, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll only be a matter of hours before we can do so. But while we ponder our new catchphrase, let\u2019s not lose the import of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s words.

The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money. With another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, nothing has been done, and all of this comes on the heels of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s warning that Russia was already looking to interfere in the 2018 midterms.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s their intention to interfere, they\u2019re going to find ways to do that,\u201d Tillerson told Fox News last month. \u201cAnd we can take steps we can take, but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it, it\u2019s very difficult to pre-empt it.\u201d\n\nOh, Mr. Tillerson, I have an idea of how we can attempt to pre-empt Russian interference.

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["muterkelly", "girls", "comes", "women", "metoo", "wendy", "wildin", "black", "young", "r", "kelly", "twisted", "assault", "sexual", "williams"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

Multiple prominent actresses, including Ashley Judd, Uma Thurman, Angelina Jolie and Lupita Nyong\u2019o, have accused Weinstein of harassing them or soliciting sexual favors in return for advancing their careers.\n\nThe statue, its creators say, was intended to draw attention to Weinstein\u2019s abuses and the culture that enabled and protected them.

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["used", "oscars", "sheriff", "using", "ashunta", "red", "perfect", "lashes", "makeup", "carpetagain", "taraji", "kiss", "p", "tarajis", "glow", "henson", "slays"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

No, it does not. If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

After a Chicago police officer took the life of Quintonio LeGrier, 19, nearly two years ago, the city\u2019s attorneys are now looking to sue his family. Their claim? That LeGrier was responsible for the death of an innocent bystander whom the cop also killed.\n\nAs the Chicago Tribune reports, the city\u2019s proposed lawsuit blames LeGrier for the death of bystander Bettie Jones, blaming him for \u201cnegligent acts and/or omissions.\u201d Those include failing to follow police commands, advancing on officers, swinging a baseball bat at police and failing \u201cto take prescribed medication to control his mental illness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a rare and exceptionally heinous step for a city to take, and one clearly aimed at shifting blame for Jones\u2019 death to LeGrier.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, this is actually the second lawsuit filed against the LeGrier family following the 2015 shooting. The officer who killed LeGrier, Robert Rialmo, filed suits in 2016 against both the Chicago Police Department (he claims he wasn\u2019t trained adequately) and LeGrier\u2019s estate. Rialmo blames the teen for the shooting and says he has suffered emotional trauma.\n\nLet\u2019s play that back one more time.\n\nThe cop who killed a teen is suing that teen\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d (though the family has no assets) because the cop suffered emotionally after killing the boy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Jones\u2019 and LeGrier\u2019s survivors have filed suits against the city for the death of their loved ones.\n\nLeGrier and Jones were shot in the early-morning hours the day after Christmas in 2015. Rialmo and another officer responded to a 911 call about a domestic disturbance in the city\u2019s West Side. LeGrier was staying there with his father, Antonio, who called 911 saying that his son was threatening him and banging on his bedroom door with a baseball bat. Later, NBC Chicago revealed that LeGrier had called 911 three times before his father called.\n\n\n\nLeGrier, a student at Northern Illinois University at the time, reportedly had mental health issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones, LeGrier\u2019s downstairs neighbor, answered the door and directed Rialmo and his partner to the second-floor apartment where LeGrier lived.\n\nFrom the Chicago Tribune:\n\nLeGrier then came down the stairs with a baseball bat, according to an analysis released in February by State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s office, which declined to bring charges against Rialmo in the incident. The police started to back up onto the front landing as the teen came toward them with the bat raised over his head, prosecutors wrote. As Rialmo backed down the stairs, he fired, according to prosecutors. He shot eight times, hitting LeGrier six times. Jones had been standing behind him and was shot once in the chest, prosecutors wrote. Rialmo recently stipulated in court that he knew Jones was standing close by when he fired, though [his attorney] said the officer was nonetheless justified in firing in self-defense. Rialmo has said he feared for his life after LeGrier swung the bat at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Tribune, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigates Chicago Police Department shootings, has yet to decide whether LeGrier\u2019s shooting was justified under CPD policy.\n\nRead more at the Chicago Tribune.", "keywords": ["death", "bat", "tribune", "wants", "officer", "family", "teen", "sue", "rialmo", "black", "legrier", "city", "jones", "legriers", "shot", "cops", "chicago"], "polarity": 0.07953216374269005, "subjectivity": 0.3375730994152047},

First, this was a follow-up question; the previous one asked respondents whether they thought sexual harassment in the workplace was a problem. This means we\u2019re looking at a pool of people who already acknowledged that sexual trespasses at work do exist and are a concern.\n\n\n\nAlso, the vast majority of these groups do consider workplace sexual harassment to be an important issue. For example, white male respondents were the least likely of all the groups to say that sexual harassment was a serious problem\u2014but it was still a clear majority at 63 percent. That\u2019s important not to lose sight of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the difference between women of color and the rest of these groups is considerable\u2014and may be explained by the double dose of discrimination that they\u2019re likely to face in the workplace.\n\nThe type of sexual harassment nonwhite women face can fold in layers of racial animus. In a recent New York Times piece, black women working at Ford plants reported being \u201cpropositioned and denounced as sluts while also being called \u2018black bitches\u2019 and other racial slurs.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this phenomenon crosses industries. In perhaps the most famous example to come out of Silicon Valley, Ellen Pao, one of the first to blow the whistle on tech\u2019s sexual harassment problems, described how her boss told her \u201che\u2019d specifically requested an Asian woman for my position. He liked the idea of a \u2018Tiger Mom\u2013raised\u2019 woman.\u201d Other Asian-American women have reported being stereotyped and demeaned in similar ways.\n\nBut why would white women be less likely than nonwhite men to consider sexual harassment a serious problem? We know from in-depth reporting across business and industries that white women certainly suffer the devastating effects of sexual abuse and misconduct, after all.\n\nThe Washington Post-ABC poll doesn\u2019t get into the why of the numbers. But Vlad Medenica, a postdoctoral scholar with GenForward Survey whose work centers on how identity shapes political and social attitudes, offered The Root some direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA potential explanation for some of this may be a history of, or different experiences with, marginalization and how that can then inform not just your perception of things, but your interpretation of different behaviors and actions,\u201d Medenica said. \u201cThat plays some role in explaining why some people think this isn\u2019t a problem and some people think this is a problem.\u201d\n\nTo put it another way, a marginalized racial identity may make you more sensitive to workplace sexual harassment than your gender identity\u2014even if women are more likely to suffer from sexual abuse in the workplace.\n\nAin\u2019t that something?", "keywords": ["white", "women", "harassment", "men", "real", "problem", "nonwhite", "groups", "survey", "likely", "serious", "say", "workplace", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.13452516233766232, "subjectivity": 0.5661106601731603},

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["beauty", "kaluuyas", "daniel", "routine", "skin", "shows", "makes", "kiehls", "fellas", "makeup", "flawless", "glow", "fenty", "look", "kaluuya", "amos"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

Some of the stories shared through the #MeToo movement have triggered a range of emotions and questions; some may have come off as \u201cgray areas.\u201d How do we actually know when we\u2019re giving or given consent?\n\nSo glad you asked. Sexual consent is when both parties agree to have sex\u2014throughout the encounter. Let\u2019s start with the basics\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cConsent 101\u201d\u2014and then explore some less orthodox situations:\n\n\n\nDo I Really Need to Hear a \u201cYes\u201d?\n\nWell, yeah. You do. Hearing \u201cyes\u201d from your partner is\u2014and should be\u2014sexy as fuck. Speaking personally, nothing turns me on more than a partner who respects my wishes and wants to know my needs. When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely. If the connection is truly there, ask and wait for validation when the other person is sober.\n\n\n\nIf They\u2019re Not of Legal Age, Guess What?\n\nDo I have to mention that minors also aren\u2019t legally allowed to consent to sexual relations with an adult? On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist. Reach out to local authorities if you ever feel unsafe from a sexual predator. Know that you\u2019re not alone and that there are a host of places willing to help you through your trauma.

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["eye", "oscars", "know", "zendaya", "shadow", "stunning", "simply", "glamour", "night", "glow", "getty", "look", "palette", "hair", "served"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

During an interview with Fox Business Network that aired Wednesday, TrumPutin was asked about the Obama administration\u2019s hold over FBI Director James Comey, the New York Daily News reports.\n\n\n\nOf course, TrumPutin found a way to make it all about Clinton because he\u2019s obsessed with her. At this point, TrumPutin is Chris Brown and Clinton is his Karrueche Tran.\n\n\u201cDirector Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton. If he weren\u2019t, she would be going to trial,\u201d TrumPutin said about the FBI director\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s reported use of private emails while handling confidential information.\n\n\n\nTrumPutin clearly misinterpreted Comey\u2019s July testimony before Congress in which he said that the FBI wouldn\u2019t prosecute Clinton or members of her team for the alleged email mishap. \u201cWhen he [Comey] was reading those charges, she was guilty of every one,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumPutin did add that it wasn\u2019t too late for him to remove Comey from his position, but noted that \u201cI have confidence in him.\u201d\n\nThe dictator in chief dismissed whether or not he would pursue charges against Clinton, noting that he only wanted to talk about \u201cpositive things.\u201d\n\nMan, this president is batshit crazy. First off, he brings up Clinton when no one was talking about her; makes all of these false claims, as this administration has been known to do; and then, when he claims that she is guilty of all these charges, he doesn\u2019t want to talk about charging her because that is not \u201cpositive\u201d topics. He\u2019s really good at being a shithead and shifting the conversation so that he can make unsubstantiated claims about a person\u2019s character without repercussion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumPutin is still trying to undo Obamacare because of course he is. At this point, Obamacare is the tattoo on his new girlfriend that reminds him of her ex. It doesn\u2019t even say the ex\u2019s name, but it\u2019s there from a time when they dated, and being the controlling dirtbag that he is, he wants it gone.\n\n\u201cHealth care is going to happen at some point,\u201d Trump said, adding that it had to come before tax reform, the Daily News reports. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal tax reform, but I have to do health care first.\u201d\n\nLastly, the president tried to talk about ongoing tensions with Russia and North Korea, but it\u2019s so hard to listen to this guy talk. He\u2019s sounds like a kid trying to answer a homework question when he didn\u2019t read the assigned chapter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s meeting with Russia\u2019s top diplomat over the country\u2019s continued support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who\u2019s accused of launching a chemical weapon attack last week on his own people, TrumPutin had this to say: \u201cI think it\u2019s very bad for Russia. I think it\u2019s very bad for mankind. If Russia didn\u2019t go in and back this animal, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem right now.\u201d\n\nAnd on North Korea, TrumPutin gave this eloquent soliloquy: \u201cWe are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. And we have the best military people. And I will say this: He is doing the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nI. Can\u2019t. With. This.

A (former) cop is finally going to prison over the shooting death of an unarmed black man.\n\nMichael Slager, a former North Charleston, S.C., police officer, has been sentenced to 19-24 years in prison for the 2015 death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black motorist whom Slager shot in the back during a routine traffic stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the ruling delivered today, U.S. District Judge David Norton found that Slager had committed second-degree murder and obstruction of justice. Norton\u2019s decision was delivered after Slager pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights offense. As ABC News reports, the guilty plea effectively \u201cend[ed] the federal case against him and also resolv[ed] the state charges that were pending after the mistrial.\u201d\n\nThis is the second time Slager has stood trial for Scott\u2019s death. Last year, Slager evaded justice when the former North Charleston cop\u2019s trial ended in a mistrial.\n\nAs The Root reported earlier, the 36-year-old Slager could have been dealt a life sentence in addition to a $250,000 fine for using excessive force during the routine traffic stop. While the 19- to 24-year sentence stops well short of that, the very fact of the prison sentence is anomalous: Officers are rarely sent to prison for fatal shootings.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Slager\u2019s lawyers attempted to use Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 faulty memory to excuse Slager\u2019s erratic, inconsistent and untrue recollection of what happened in the moments leading up to Scott\u2019s death. The ex-cop had lied multiple times about the event, originally claiming that he had shot Scott in self-defense.\n\nCellphone footage taken by a bystander later revealed that Slager had, in fact, shot Scott in the back as he was fleeing from the cop.\n\nRead more at ABC News.", "keywords": ["death", "prison", "unarmed", "routine", "cop", "sentence", "shooting", "black", "walter", "sentenced", "20", "scott", "shot", "traffic", "slager"], "polarity": 0.021388888888888888, "subjectivity": 0.36777777777777776},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry. Their first initiative? An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage.

We come in peace, but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time\u2019s up. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, time\u2019s up for discrimination, time\u2019s up for harassment of any kind, and time\u2019s up for the abuse of power. Because you see, it\u2019s not just going on in Hollywood, it\u2019s not just going on in Washington; it\u2019s right here in our industry as well. And just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo a culture that does not serve us well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a Grammys moment well worth remembering, and \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business\u201d are words we won\u2019t be surprised to hear become a common phrase within the #TimesUp moment.\n\nWhile we\u2019re already ready to say it with our chests, in our fast-fashion culture, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll only be a matter of hours before we can do so.

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite?

Abelove is accused of concealing evidence in the shooting of 37-year-old Edson Thevenin and then lying during the subsequent investigation. He is also accused of repeatedly interfering with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s efforts to investigate the shooting.

Randall French after a traffic stop for suspected drunken driving went awry in April 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn New York, a 2015 executive order by Gov. Andrew Cuomo requires the attorney general to investigate and criminally prosecute any case in which a police officer kills an unarmed civilian. Rather than provide Schneiderman with requested information related to the shooting, Abelove chose to present a truncated version of the case to a grand jury, and French was cleared of any wrongdoing less than a week after the shooting.\n\nAbelove\u2019s actions exemplify the type of behavior that Cuomo\u2019s executive order is meant to prevent.\n\n\u201cAs we allege, District Attorney Abelove\u2019s actions violated the law and undermined a criminal investigation,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cThe governor\u2019s executive order was designed to restore public confidence in our criminal-justice system \u2014 yet the actions we detail today only served to further erode that confidence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrench pulled Thevenin over April 17, 2016, on suspicion of drunken driving.

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

An acknowledged survivor of sexual assault herself, Oprah viewed this moment as a culmination of so many stories, catalyzed by a few not-so-good men:\n\nEverything that\u2019s happened has brought us to this point in time. We\u2019ve been working our way through a lot of repressed pain, anger, shame, and disappointment. And we weren\u2019t honoring our own voices.

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["blige", "hairstylist", "mary", "talks", "soul", "natural", "beautiful", "florence", "hiphop", "queen", "mudbound", "netflix", "unmaking", "davis", "lawrence", "hair", "j"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

Based upon the facts and recommendations presented to me, I made the decision to place Officer Derick Wiley on indefinite suspension. This is a term used for civil service employees, but it effectively means Officer Wiley\u2019s employment has been terminated.\n\nOur internal investigation revealed that Officer Wiley violated department policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will not be making any additional comments until the Dallas County Grand Jury completes its process.\n\n***\n\nEditor\u2019s note: At approximately 4:21 a.m. ET Saturday, Lyndo Jones was readmitted to the hospital because of serious complications stemming from the shooting. The Root will update you on his condition as details become available.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerick Wiley, 35, a 10-year veteran with the Mesquite Police Department in Dallas County, Texas, will face a grand jury on Nov. 28 to determine if he will face criminal charges for the Nov. 8 shooting of Lyndo Jones, 31, Jones\u2019 attorney S. Lee Merritt exclusively shared with The Root.\n\n\n\nWiley is currently on paid administrative leave pending the conclusion of two separate investigations into the shooting, one by the Mesquite Police Department and the other by the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nOn the night of Nov. 8, Jones was sitting inside his vehicle when the car alarm malfunctioned and began blaring. As he struggled to turn it off, someone approached him and asked if he needed assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones said that he did not, but that didn\u2019t stop the unidentified person from calling 911 and claiming that Jones was attempting to steal his own vehicle. The 911 call triggered a series of events that ended with Wiley shooting Jones twice in the back even though he was unarmed with his hands raised.\n\nJones was violently searched before being taken into custody and handcuffed to a bed while in critical condition at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. He was also denied his right to family visitation, according to his legal counsel, criminal defense attorney Justin Moore, who stepped in to represent Jones on behest of civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt.\n\nMerritt is representing Jones in his civil case against Dallas County and the Mesquite Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Jones was first taken into custody and hospitalized, there were no criminal charges filed against him, which led Moore to investigate why Jones was still technically being held by the Police Department.\n\nDays later, after Moore was forcibly removed from the hospital for insisting that the MPD immediately halt an illegal interrogation of his client, Jones was charged with evading arrest.\n\nAccording to Jones, he requested that his attorney be present for the questioning, but was told by MPD investigators that he didn\u2019t need an attorney because they weren\u2019t there to interrogate him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLt. Brian Parrish, a spokesperson for the Mesquite Police Department, insisted during a press conference that questioning Jones without legal counsel present was not in violation of his constitutional rights because he was not being questioned as a suspect but as a \u201cpossible complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my investigators spoke to this individual in the hospital ... it was consensual and it was in reference to him being shot. It was not in reference to any offense he may or may not have committed,\u201d Parrish said.\n\nParrish\u2019s claim runs counter to that of Jones\u2019 attorneys, who were told by guards that Jones would absolutely not be questioned without his lawyers present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office reviewed Wiley\u2019s bodycam footage of the shooting, leading District Attorney Faith Johnson to dismiss the misdemeanor charge against Jones\u2014on the same day the MPD filed it\u2014and to open a criminal investigation against Wiley.\n\n\n\nJones was finally released on Nov. 15, but according to Parrish, the charge may be revisited.\n\nThe Mesquite Police Department claims that Jones \u201cdemonstrated such physical strength that it took three officers just to hold him down until paramedics could arrive at the scene to assess his injuries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that, I\u2019m not an expert on human strength, but I think if someone has been shot and handcuffed and on the ground, and it still takes four large men to hold him down, that might indicate there are other factors in place,\u201d Parrish told local station CBS-DFW.\n\nNot content to play games with the Mesquite Police Department, Merritt, who is representing Jones in his civil case against the MPD, unapologetically admits that his client was high on marijuana and cocaine while sitting in his parked vehicle. Still, he makes it clear that his being high should not give police officers license to shoot unarmed people who are minding their own business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe romanticized search for the perfect victim is futile and dangerous,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cMy client was doing absolutely nothing that warranted this police officer opening fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this pre-emptive, transparent vilification of innocent people play out time and time again,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cLyndo Jones is a hardworking father of two young daughters who was profiled by a stranger and shot by Officer Wiley for no reason at all. Wiley is the violent perpetrator here, not my client.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Merritt, the Nov. 28 grand jury hearing means nothing in and of itself. What matters, he says, is that Wiley will be charged and convicted of a crime that was not only a willful abuse of his state-sanctioned power but also emblematic of the violence that infests police departments across the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe district attorney [Faith Johnson] has not issued criminal charges against the officer who shot Lyndo Jones twice in the back with his hands up despite abundant probable cause,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cOnly 1 percent of law-enforcement misconduct is prosecuted in the state of Texas. That is by design.\u201d\n\nMerritt, who also represents the family of Jordan Edwards, the 15-year-old boy fatally shot by Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver, says that the grand jury process is tainted and shrouded in secrecy, and only through exposing that truth is reform possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOliver was fired from his job and charged with one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault by a public servant\u2014one charge for each of the young boys in the car with Jordan, including two of his brothers.\n\nThe charges alone against a police officer in Texas are extremely rare, but that is no cause for celebration. There has been no trial, yet; subsequently, there has been no conviction\u2014even though Oliver executed a child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProsecutors make unique exceptions when dealing with police involved malfeasance,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nIn Jones\u2019 case, Wiley\u2019s bodycam allegedly captured the entire incident, and his attorneys are openly encouraging the MPD to release the footage.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the video is highly incriminating against the police officer and my client, and I urge the Mesquite Police Department to be transparent and release it immediately,\u201d Merritt told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious organizations have formed the Coalition for Justice for Lyndo Jones, including Mothers Against Police Brutality, the American Black Cross, the Texas Organizing Project, Friendship-West Baptist Church, the Arlington chapter of the NAACP, the Dallas chapter of the NAACP, Faith-Forward Dallas and Joy Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n\n\nClick here to donate to the YouCaring fund established for Jones to assist with medical and legal expenses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to sign the petition urging the Dallas County DA\u2019s Office to issue an arrest warrant for Mesquite Police Officer Derick Wiley.", "keywords": ["jury", "fired", "dallas", "face", "officer", "shooting", "wiley", "grand", "merritt", "department", "attorney", "lyndo", "jones", "told", "texas", "mesquite"], "polarity": 0.04906768837803321, "subjectivity": 0.4688305053822294},

He is yet another member of this administration who has proved himself to be dishonest, and because of his position as U.S. attorney general, his actions and lies are especially egregious.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that everyone is foaming at the mouth about allegations that he had conversations and dealings with Russia, but was otherwise silent about him being a racist pushing an agenda that will have a direct negative impact on people of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who may not have time to click through, some of the highlights are included below. All quotes are directly from the Washington Post.\n\nJeff Sessions:\n\nFirst, about the comments that I made to the committee that have been said to be incorrect and false, let me be clear. I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost notes:\n\n\n\nThat \u201cabout the Trump campaign\u201d clause is the key qualifier here. Sessions said in sworn testimony during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d The question involved the campaign, but he wasn\u2019t asked directly whether he spoke with Russia ABOUT the campaign. Sessions also said The Washington Post\u2019s report Wednesday night was \u201cfalse\u201d even though the report didn\u2019t alleged he had spoken about the campaign with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions:\n\n[T]he idea that I was part of a quote, \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government is totally false.\n\nPost notes:\n\nThis quote is from Sen. Al Franken\u2019s (D-Minn.) question to Sessions, which elicited Sessions\u2019s denial. But Franken didn\u2019t ask Sessions whether he was part of the \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign. He said that phrase while summarizing a news report and then asked Sessions, \u201cif there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\u201d Sessions\u2019s argument is basically that he understood\u2014and perhaps misunderstood\u2014this question to be only talking about the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\n\n\n[M]y reply to the question of Senator Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time.\n\nPost notes:\n\n\u201cAs I understood it at the time\u201d is an interesting phrase. It seems to allow Sessions, if he needs to, to say that he misunderstood the question. That could help him if he ever were to face a perjury charge\u2014which, we should note, there is no evidence of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\nIn fact, on Monday of this week, we set a meeting with an eye to a final decision on this question. And on Monday, we set that meeting today. So this was a day that we planned to have a final discussion about handling this. I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost notes:\n\n\n\nSessions says he will recuse himself from matters involving the Trump campaign\u2014but also makes clear that it was a decision that predated the current controversy. This allows him to claim he\u2019s not admitting fault.\n\nIt goes on and on. I highly encourage you to take the time to click through and read the transcript along with the Post\u2019s notes, because what Sessions did during the press conference was the most fabulous display of legal acrobatics that I have seen in quite some time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["sessions", "doubletalk", "displays", "inquiry", "transcript", "report", "press", "lawyer", "campaign", "washington", "asked", "recuses", "russian", "skills", "question", "jeff", "trump", "russia"], "polarity": 0.12680851063829787, "subjectivity": 0.48185410334346496},

She\u2019s seeking $5 million in damages from Simmons\u2014a number her lawyer estimates is about 1 percent of Simmons\u2019 net worth, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nIn the court filing, Jarosik says that she met Simmons in 2006 in New York, at which point he agreed to get involved with her film. Over the years, Jarosik says, she and Simmons bonded over their shared \u201clove and passion for meditation, yoga and a vegan diet.\u201d\n\nBut the relationship turned in August 2016, after Jarosik says Simmons invited her over to his Los Angeles home, where he asked her to have sex.\n\nJarosik alleges that after she said no, Simmons \u201cgot aggressive,\u201d pushing her onto his bed and then, in an ensuing struggle, pushing her back off it, causing her to hit her head. Jarosik says in her suit that while she was stunned and \u201cin shock\u201d from the blow, Simmons \u201cproceeded to rape her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimmons, through his representative Eric Rose, denies the allegations. According to USA Today, Simmons called the allegations horrific and \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to having my day in court\u2014where, unlike the court of public opinion, I will have the ability to make use of fair processes that ensure that justice will be done and that the full truth will be known,\u201d Simmons said.\n\n\n\nJarosik\u2019s claim is but one in a torrent of allegations of sexual abuse against the 60-year-old multimillionaire. As TMZ reports, more than a dozen women have now accused the hip-hop mogul of rape, and as of earlier this month, seven accusers have filed police reports with the New York City Police Department against Simmons. In fact, two of those accusers filed rape reports on the same day Simmons decided to cease his #NotMe campaign\u2014his social media clapback to #MeToo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no statute of limitations on sexual assault charges in New York. California, until recently, placed a 10-year limit on pursuing charges for sexual assault crimes. But\u2014largely because of Bill Cosby\u2019s case of alleged serial sexual abuse\u2014a bill passed in the state legislature last year that lifted that limit.\n\nJarosik repeatedly referred to the Time\u2019s Up initiative in her suit, saying that the time had come to call out the hip-hop industry for its rampant misogyny, and for Simmons to be held accountable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to the Daily News, Jarosik\u2019s attorney, Perry Wander, put it more succinctly.\n\n\u201cMr. Simmons practices meditation, yoga and is a long time vegan practicing non-violence against animals,\u201d Wander said. \u201cSo basically he treats animals better than women.

I stayed away because I simply couldn\u2019t get over the fact that my perfect Belle, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a woman so beautiful and charismatic that I imagine little woodland creatures do chores for her simply to be in her presence, was cast as a gotdamn feather duster, while Emma Watson landed the lead role. (Watson is a perfectly capable actress, just #NotMyBelle.)\n\n\n\nLuckily for all of us, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s star has only continued to rise, with British Vogue now hailing her as Britain\u2019s \u201cbreakout star\u201d on its April cover. The 34-year-old actress graces the top fashion magazine looking like a red-velvet dream.\n\nPhoto: Mikael Jansson (Vogue UK/Cond\u00e9 Nast)\n\nMbatha-Raw lands the cover amid a publicity blitz for A Wrinkle in Time, the Ava DuVernay-helmed adaptation of the children\u2019s literary classic of the same name. In the film, Mbatha-Raw plays Dr. Kate Murry, mother to tween Meg Murry (Storm Reid), who embarks on an epic journey to find her father, Alex, played by Chris Pine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a recent Vogue buzz notes, Mbatha-Raw has been \u201cescaping archetypes and quietly shaping a diverse CV for years.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s given riveting performances on both movie and TV screens, playing the title role in the period biopic Belle; showing off her singing skills as a troubled rock star in Beyond the Lights; and taking a time-traveling turn in the iconic, Emmy Award-winning \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode of Black Mirror (which seemed to serve as inspiration for Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s latest video, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d). Mbatha-Raw even manages to be captivating in Netflix\u2019s less-than-stellar recent release, The Cloverfield Paradox.\n\nAnd on the red carpet, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s sartorial growth has been equally impressive. This recent slideshow from Vogue UK tracks Mbatha-Raw\u2019s maturation as she settles into more streamlined, polished shapes with bold colors and textures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt certainly feels like Mbatha-Raw is coming into her moment, though she\u2019s been patiently building her career for decades, starting, as many Brits do, on the stage.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, you have power over your performance, but no power over the distribution or timetable,\u201d she recently told Refinery 29. \u201cSo it just so happens this is all coming out at the same time. But I guess I should embrace the ride!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbatha-Raw also talked about the power of seemingly innocuous beauty choices, like how to wear her hair on-screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to play a woman and not have race be the focus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will always bring who I am to the story and make sure my ethnicity is celebrated on-screen. I\u2019m not afraid to have those tough conversations with directors about how I represent myself. Hair, for instance, sounds like a superficial conversation. But images remain in our subconscious. So when it comes to representing on-screen, I can use my hair to send the important message to girls everywhere that they can be who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: British Vogue\u2019s April issue, featuring Mbatha-Raw\u2019s cover and interview, is available on newsstands Friday, March 9.

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["marketable", "women", "hereweare", "woman", "spot", "female", "black", "rees", "night", "oscar", "williams", "despite"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["used", "oscars", "sheriff", "using", "ashunta", "red", "perfect", "lashes", "makeup", "carpetagain", "taraji", "kiss", "p", "tarajis", "glow", "henson", "slays"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

I said, \u2018Feel what?\u2019 I wanted to act like I didn\u2019t. I pushed myself off with a laugh. Then later, he asked, \u2018Do you think I want to fuck you?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and he got angry. He said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t, and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019 He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim said that while she was in the hot tub with Vereen, things went even further after he asked her to perform oral sex and left her feeling \u201cconfused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think at the time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had a choice. I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I was intimidated and scared. He was being very intense and angry. He seemed very angry and offended. I had seen him behave this way toward others in the tribe during circle,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just felt powerless because I thought I really needed his help and guidance. And when he said nudity doesn\u2019t have to be sexual, I was like, \u2018OK, maybe this isn\u2019t even sexual,\u2019\u201d Kim added. \u201cNow I understand it was a power play. It was so calculated. It was like we were putty in his hands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News notes:\n\nIn his statement, Vereen said he gained new perspective on his behavior in the last two years. \u201cWhile it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me,\u201d his statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim acknowledged that she eventually became involved in a relationship with Vereen, saying that she told herself it was more spiritual than sexual.\n\nAnother actress, Ariella Pizarro, accused Vereen of pressing himself against her one night as he hugged her goodbye, before later texting her, \u201cYo (sic) felt so good tonight.\u201d\n\nFrom the Daily News:\n\nThe News obtained a copy of the text message sent by Vereen and confirmed the number was listed in his name. Pizarro said Vereen also randomly kissed her on the lips in the first few weeks of rehearsals, when she was 22 years old. \u201cWe were in a music rehearsal, and he was just walking around, and then he walked up and kissed me on the lips. It was so weird. We all knew Hair was going to be a different kind of production, like in the \u201960s, but he didn\u2019t even ask first. He just kissed me. I was shocked, for sure,\u201d Pizarro said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t shove his tongue down my throat, but it gave me an uneasy feeling. Then he moved on. I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom that point on, I kept myself at arm\u2019s length with Ben.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCast members also recalled an uncomfortable moment when they had to strip for a rehearsal exercise and Vereen decided he would get naked, too.\n\n\u201cIt was uncomfortable, to say the least,\u201d Pizarro noted.\n\nAs for Venice Theatre, which was supposed to be watching out for these young women, officials said they only became fully aware of the extent of the allegations after Terpstra posted on Facebook about the experience back in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe theater reached out to every member of the Hair cast, getting in contact with all but six of the 32 individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have learned recently that during our 2015 production of Hair, more than one female cast member was asked to join Mr. Vereen at his residence. Some of those visits resulted in compromising situations for at least two of the actresses,\u201d Executive Director Murray Chase said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.\u201d\n\nThat being said, Terpstra said that Chase had to step in during one particularly volatile confrontation with Vereen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News reports:\n\nTerpstra said she\u2019s not sure exactly what she told [Chase], but she thinks she mentioned at least one forced kiss. She said Chase later sat in on the final dress rehearsal, but Vereen was not banned from the building. Chase told the News he remembered the hallway incident but thought it was isolated. \u201cWhile we were aware of an altercation between Ben Vereen and Ms. Terpstra, we have now learned of additional situations,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Terpstra and Kim said that the experience with Vereen had lasting effects on their careers, with neither having acted in a production since, although both have stayed in the creative fields, with Terpstra going toward burlesque, while Kim returned to a job at the Venice Theatre to \u201credefine that space.\u201d", "keywords": ["sexually", "assaulting", "didnt", "women", "vereen", "broadway", "ben", "star", "production", "young", "terpstra", "asked", "daily", "actresses", "feel", "sexual", "hair"], "polarity": 0.029034894398530763, "subjectivity": 0.4628856749311295},

The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director.

The jury convicted him of first-degree manslaughter and recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKepler and his daughter, Lisa Kepler, had previous arguments about her bringing men home, so she left. Shannon found out Lisa was dating Lake from a Facebook profile. Authorities testified that Shannon may have found Lake\u2019s address from a juvenile file that was supposed to be sealed. The back of the file listed Lake\u2019s address and his presumed race\u2014black.\n\nAccording to CBS News, in August 2014 Shannon Kepler sat in his SUV near Lake\u2019s home and spotted Lake and his 18-year-old daughter walking together. The 24-year veteran of the Tulsa Police Department said that he was trying to protect his daughter because she had run away from home numerous times and was living in a \u201ccrime-ridden neighborhood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Kepler saw the couple, he got out of his car and asked Lisa what she was doing there.

Each trial ended in a deadlocked jury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case was partially obscured by another police shooting four days earlier, when Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson, Mo.

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ...

So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular.

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["eye", "oscars", "know", "zendaya", "shadow", "stunning", "simply", "glamour", "night", "glow", "getty", "look", "palette", "hair", "served"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

She\u2019s seeking $5 million in damages from Simmons\u2014a number her lawyer estimates is about 1 percent of Simmons\u2019 net worth, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nIn the court filing, Jarosik says that she met Simmons in 2006 in New York, at which point he agreed to get involved with her film. Over the years, Jarosik says, she and Simmons bonded over their shared \u201clove and passion for meditation, yoga and a vegan diet.\u201d\n\nBut the relationship turned in August 2016, after Jarosik says Simmons invited her over to his Los Angeles home, where he asked her to have sex.\n\nJarosik alleges that after she said no, Simmons \u201cgot aggressive,\u201d pushing her onto his bed and then, in an ensuing struggle, pushing her back off it, causing her to hit her head. Jarosik says in her suit that while she was stunned and \u201cin shock\u201d from the blow, Simmons \u201cproceeded to rape her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimmons, through his representative Eric Rose, denies the allegations. According to USA Today, Simmons called the allegations horrific and \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to having my day in court\u2014where, unlike the court of public opinion, I will have the ability to make use of fair processes that ensure that justice will be done and that the full truth will be known,\u201d Simmons said.\n\n\n\nJarosik\u2019s claim is but one in a torrent of allegations of sexual abuse against the 60-year-old multimillionaire. As TMZ reports, more than a dozen women have now accused the hip-hop mogul of rape, and as of earlier this month, seven accusers have filed police reports with the New York City Police Department against Simmons. In fact, two of those accusers filed rape reports on the same day Simmons decided to cease his #NotMe campaign\u2014his social media clapback to #MeToo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no statute of limitations on sexual assault charges in New York. California, until recently, placed a 10-year limit on pursuing charges for sexual assault crimes. But\u2014largely because of Bill Cosby\u2019s case of alleged serial sexual abuse\u2014a bill passed in the state legislature last year that lifted that limit.\n\nJarosik repeatedly referred to the Time\u2019s Up initiative in her suit, saying that the time had come to call out the hip-hop industry for its rampant misogyny, and for Simmons to be held accountable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to the Daily News, Jarosik\u2019s attorney, Perry Wander, put it more succinctly.\n\n\u201cMr. Simmons practices meditation, yoga and is a long time vegan practicing non-violence against animals,\u201d Wander said. \u201cSo basically he treats animals better than women.

Young people who look at me to give them something to hold onto, that special nugget that just may help them get through.

To be unsure of your place in this realm, of how you will ever find it or how you will ever like yourself, let alone love yourself. ...

Police officers often never faced justice from the courts or the cities that employ them. The deaths of these unarmed black men and women sparked the Black Lives Matter movement, Colin Kaepernick taking a knee, the Ferguson, Mo., revolt and dozens of other forms of resistance across the nation in the last five years.\n\nOften forgotten in these stories is the \u201clone survivor\u201d of Black Lives Matter, Leon Ford Jr. He faced death at the hands of police like so many others, but lived\u2014and his battle with the Pittsburgh criminal-justice system is a reminder that sometimes the hardest battles come after the shooting stops.\n\n\n\nYouTube screenshot\n\nIn November of 2012, Leon Ford Jr. was pulled over by police who were \u201cfishing\u201d in Pittsburgh\u2019s predominantly black District 5. Fishing is when police randomly run tags on cars looking for an excuse to pull someone over. Despite a 16-minute interrogation and Ford handing over his license, registration and other documentation, the police insisted that he was, in fact, Lamont Ford, a known gang member, and threatened Leon repeatedly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficer Andrew Miller jumped into Ford\u2019s car and attempted to pull him out through the passenger side. When the vehicle kicked into gear during the struggle, another officer, David Derbish, shot Ford five times. Ford remembers falling out of his car onto the concrete, bleeding, as the officers cursed over his body, mocking him, hoping that he\u2019d die. If it weren\u2019t for the actions of a good Samaritan calling an ambulance, Ford might\u2019ve been on the list of names at the start of this story. As a reminder of the perverse power of racism, the Pittsburgh district attorney charged Leon Ford Jr. with criminal assault of the officers, and it wasn\u2019t until spring of 2015, almost three years after he was shot, that the charges were thrown out and the DA chose not to pursue other charges.\n\nDuring that time, all three of the officers involved, despite being under investigation, were promoted to detective. Ford\u2019s own civil rights case against the officers who shot him ended on Tuesday with less-than-stellar results. Officer Miller was found not guilty of assault and battery, and the jury deadlocked on whether Derbish used excessive force. We spoke to Ford and his lawyer Thomas Malone about what comes next.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Leon, you survived getting shot by police five times, then having the DA attempt to charge you with criminal assault. You got through all of that. Why sue the police? Why not just say, \u201cI got through this\u2014I just want to get on with my life?\u201d\n\n\n\nLeon Ford Jr.: I wanted to stand up and get justice. I witnessed [the police] lie under oath in criminal court. I watched them get away with shooting me, and I could not let that happen. I felt convicted in my spirt to not let this happen. I felt I had to not only fight for myself but for others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I had been content with letting this thing go and not fought it, then things would not have come out. There are things that police testified to under oath. These are gonna be things that in the near future we can use to change some policy in Pennsylvania and across the country.\n\nThomas Malone: In a situation like this where the police officer who shot Leon wasn\u2019t arrested, there was really no other avenue for justice. The difference in this case is that Leon lived through it. The whitewashing that the facts often get didn\u2019t happen in this situation. If he hadn\u2019t survived, then their version of the story\u2014that the officers shot him because he dragged them with his car\u2014would have survived the paperwork, and they\u2019d have gone about their business. There is a ton of information that we got through the civil discovery process.\n\nIt took almost years of pretrial motions for Leon Ford to get his day in court against the officers who profiled him, harassed him and attempted to kill him. But during that process and the trial, it came out that the officers in question, Michael Kosko, Andrew Miller and David Derbish, had all left their microphones in their squad cars when they pulled Ford over. After years of Ford insisting that he complied with everything the officers asked, only through trial was it revealed and proven through a distant microphone that he asked, \u201cCan I just get my ticket and go home?\u201d while the officers screamed, \u201cFuck you, you\u2019re talking to the cops,\u201d and \u201cYou better get your black ass out of the car when police tell you to get out of the car.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was also made clear during the trial that the police lied by claiming that they thought Ford had a gun, claiming they saw an unnatural bulge, but only two of the three officers mentioned it in their report because they hadn\u2019t had time to get their stories together.\n\nTR: Leon, you were one of the first \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d stories. You were shot the same year that Trayvon Martin was killed. You\u2019ve seen Ferguson, Tamir Rice and other stories. What have the last five years taught you about America\u2019s criminal-justice system? Are things getting better or worse?\n\nLF: The last five years have taught me that most people are happy with lip service. When I think of how they have stepped out and spoke about police brutality\u2014there\u2019s gonna come a time when they\u2019re gonna put up or shut up. When they do give that lip service, they stand behind policies that encourage brutality and racial division.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTM: I\u2019ve seen some change. We showed up for [civil trial] jury selection with 94 people\u2014not ONE African American on the panel. One of the prospective jurors asked me a question which is rare\u2014most prospective jurors don\u2019t ask anything\u2014she said, \u201cIs this fair that Leon\u2019s jury is going to be all white people?\u201d That\u2019s change. At least somebody noticed that. There were a couple Asian, Hispanic, Indian, Pakistani people in the jury pool but nobody black, and it\u2019s supposed to be a jury of his peers. I\u2019m proud of the work we did. I\u2019m proud of the fact that we live to fight another day.\n\nTR: Leon, what\u2019s next for you in the trial, in activism and even personally? I\u2019ve seen online that you\u2019re able to walk now with some assistance, which is a miracle. What new activism will you be engaging in going forward?\n\nLF: Personally, I did write a book\u2014that\u2019s on ice until this case is finished. I\u2019ll be out at universities sharing my story. Helping families that are experiencing the same thing around the country. Moving forward with my rehabilitation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTM: Oct. 20, we will stand ready to go and pick a new jury\u2014and try this case again and make sure justice gets done.\n\nIf you want to be inspired, take a look at video of Ford finally being able to walk on his own, five years after being shot by police. He\u2019s benefited from several rehabilitation centers in Pittsburgh and even the use of exoskeleton technology that allows him to move without a walker.

A world where there are often still very harsh and unjust realities attached to being young, black and in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nThis is the crux of Netflix\u2019s new crime drama Seven Seconds, a series that devolves into a corrupt labyrinth after the hit-and-run killing of a young black teenager by a white cop in New Jersey. To be clear: That\u2019s not a spoiler. Those events happen within the first five minutes of the first episode, and what we\u2019re left with is the aftermath, excellently acted by an ensemble cast that includes Fences\u2019 Russell Hornsby and the always incredible Regina King.\n\nBut the breakout star in Seven Seconds is Clare-Hope Ashitey, as deeply troubled Assistant District Attorney K.J. Harper, a young woman grappling with her own demons as she tries to find the truth behind the blue wall of silence. The Glow Up spoke with Ashitey in anticipation of Seven Seconds\u2019 debut on Netflix on Feb. 23. The British-Ghanaian actress (Fun fact: She also played Sara, the \u201cone who got away,\u201d in the first episode of last year\u2019s Emmy-winning season of Master of None) told us that K.J.\u2019s fallibility was one of her main attractions to the role:\n\nShe\u2019s complicated and flawed and layered and nuanced\u2014I think all of the characters are to varying degrees, actually. And that\u2019s one of the things that drew me to it in the first place: that she was like a person, like we all are. You know, we\u2019re not one thing or another\u2014it\u2019s not one end of the spectrum or the other end of the spectrum. We all have different facets to us and personality traits, and we have our flaws and we have our upsides, and good days and bad days, and we make good decisions, we make poor decisions. And I think that really attracted me as a person, [to] try and to figure out what those levels were for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn K.J. we see a young, accomplished woman who never seems to feel that she measures up, gauging everything by her biggest mistakes, and punishing herself daily for her imperfections, even as she tries to redeem herself. It\u2019s a relatable conundrum, if, at times, difficult to watch. Ashitey tell us:\n\nI think K.J. specifically, watching her grow and change over the course of the show, is very interesting and, I think, definitely to me as, like, a person, quite inspiring because it can be easy to think of progress as linear. And often you see in TV shows where someone had a moment and it turns everything around, and then everything goes right for them, and they go up and up and up. But watching K.J. felt\u2014or playing K.J. felt\u2014much more true to definitely my life, where you have a moment where you decide to do something, and then you start doing it, and then two days later you hit a setback, and then you go, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore because it\u2019s too hard.\u201d And either you get over the obstacle yourself, or somebody drags you over it. And then you take two steps forward and another five back and you stumble a bit forwards. And watching someone progress in that quite painful way but still making some progress, I think it was definitely helpful to me because things can be very defeating, and it can be very easy to give in to what feels like failure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to Seven Seconds, Ashitey was perhaps best known for the BBC hit Doctor Foster and the 2006 dystopian thriller Children of Men, starring Clive Owen and Julianne Moore. Breaking into the U.S. market with Seven Seconds isn\u2019t something she takes lightly, especially as a British actor playing an African American:\n\nThere definitely are a lot more opportunities, and there\u2019s a lot more work on this side of the pond, and that is attracting a lot of British actors, and I understand the [frustration] over here, African American and otherwise. Like, it\u2019s a competitive industry, first and foremost, and nobody wants the pool to get any bigger. And I guess when also dealing with something like racial issues, I entirely understand people feeling ownership of their own cultural heritage. And when things are portrayed that affect them, I understand people feeling protective over that, and it\u2019s a difficult issue to broach. I wanted this job, and I think these issues are important, and I thought I could do a good job of it, and I care about these issues. And I think that makes me as good a candidate for this job as any other. And I think it\u2019s difficult. I think we are entering pretty dangerous territory when we start drawing lines and boundaries on who is allowed to do what, because that works both ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut beyond earning the coveted role of K.J. Harper, Ashitey takes very seriously the issues explored in Seven Seconds, issues that elevate the discussion of police misconduct to entirely new levels, as well as our culpability and responsibility to one another:\n\nThe show as a whole, I think we\u2019re trying to contribute to a conversation that needs to be had right now in America specifically, and in the world in general. ... Specifically looking at the African-American community, hopefully offering some validation to experiences that are real and that happen all the time and that have been happening for a very long time ... for a certain portion of the American community to feel like they\u2019re seen and what\u2019s happening to them is being seen and is being thought about by people is important.\n\nAnd what was it like working with child star-turned-acting powerhouse Regina King?\n\nShe was great. She\u2019s such a fantastic person. ... And quite aside from the fact that she\u2019s excellent at her job and she is a wonderful actor, to be able to go to work and spend time outside of work with someone who is, like, fun and interesting and approachable, I mean, that\u2019s what we all want. Everyone wants to spend time with people that they like and who like them, and I think those people on this production found that in Regina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she is currently still based in her native London, Ashitey\u2019s turn in the highly watchable Seven Seconds may very well cement her a place in the rotation of black actresses in Hollywood who still outnumber the roles readily available. But for now, she remains focused on the present and on what she\u2019s created as K.J. Harper. When it comes to future roles, she remains confident that her instincts will be her best guide:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s very hard to pin down a dream job, because I\u2019m very script-led, and there isn\u2019t, like, a particular role I\u2019d like to play. There are lots of people I\u2019d love to work with, but first and foremost, there\u2019s a certain feeling I think you get when you read a script and you think, \u201cThis is good,\u201d or maybe, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great, and I\u2019m going to really enjoy, like, playing this character and being this person.\u201d So it\u2019s anything that makes me feel like that.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The first season of Seven Seconds premieres Feb. 23 for your bingeing pleasure.", "keywords": ["watch", "makes", "job", "mark", "think", "person", "seven", "ashitey", "netflixs", "good", "black", "seconds", "clarehope", "kj", "issues"], "polarity": 0.13290878711931345, "subjectivity": 0.4950136162918116},

I shouldn\u2019t have such a high bar for the content of conversations I overhear in a busy food court, particularly in the section immediately adjacent to Panda Express. But alas, I still have the Obama hopey-changey bug, so I ate my orange chicken bowl and smiled warmly at the two suited men who sat next to me. Until they started talking.\n\n\u201cThey got James Franco, too? You can\u2019t even tell a woman she looks nice without getting #MeToo\u2019ed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gotta be more careful out here. Where\u2019s our safe space?!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one iteration of a conversation I\u2019ve heard from men in the past few months that rests on a bed of balderdash more egregious than Panda\u2019s claim of authentic Chinese food. This particular myth is that:\n\n1. Men are being fired/prosecuted/publicly shamed for innocuous acts like a polite compliment.\n\nThis simply isn\u2019t true. Workplace harassment doesn\u2019t include pleasant niceties. The men who claim as much are either willfully ignorant or painfully stupid. There\u2019s \u201cHi, Sandra, you look nice today,\u201d and then there\u2019s \u201cWow, Sandra, you really filled out that dress well,\u201d which is typically accompanied with a lewd appraisal and delayed stare. Stop this gaslighting now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis idea is often paired with another nasty notion I\u2019ve heard repeated by both men and women (but let\u2019s be honest; according to my unofficial GroupMe survey, it\u2019s 95 percent men):\n\n2. It\u2019s only harassment when the harasser is unattractive or undesirable (e.g., Harvey Weinstein).\n\nFalse. Harassment has nothing to do with the appearance of the harasser and everything to do with the behavior of the harasser (and the fact that the recipient is uncomfortable, nonconsenting or simply not interested).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only do people presume that you want generic Idris Elba from your office\u2014you know, the guy with the confidence of Stringer Bell minus the accent and with a stare that\u2019s more dehumanizing than smoldering\u2014but they presume that your response is an indication of whether or not the act is harassment. Which brings me to the next misconception:\n\n3. If a person doesn\u2019t immediately denounce a harasser or, worse, dares to laugh along, he or she must have liked it.\n\nWrong again. In the \u201950s and \u201960s, when domestics were asked by their employers, \u201cWhat do you think of all this civil rights stuff? We treat you good, right?\u201d they often replied something to the effect of, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t fool with that. I don\u2019t want anything to do with that trouble.\u201d They didn\u2019t mean it then, and women don\u2019t always mean it now when we laugh off men\u2019s harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy nature of the power that a harasser often has over a woman\u2014whether it be their seniority, their popularity in the office or simply their ability to make you look like an aggressive woman (and, for some of us, an angry black woman)\u2014women are often left with few choices. So if you hear a conversation like this:\n\nHim: You should wear skirts more often; you\u2019ve got such great legs! No wonder the client loves you. Her: It\u2019s either that or my ability to turn around contracts in record time. Total toss-up! Haha!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no need for you to conclude that she appreciated it. For one, consider how infuriating it is for women in the workplace, corporate or otherwise, to have to consistently assert to others that we should be judged based on the work we do versus how we look.\n\nSecond, think about the consequences a woman faces for calling out the fan of her skirts. She could be ostracized, viewed as aggressive, dragged through a lengthy HR process that ends in little or no action aside from a waste of her time, or, worse, passed up for opportunities because she didn\u2019t go along to get along.\n\nI realize that most of my examples are related to men harassing women. But that brings me to the next myth:\n\n4. Women are the only recipients of workplace harassment, and the perpetrators are always men.\n\nNope. My husband likes to joke that before he introduces himself to people, he tells them he\u2019s married, just so there\u2019s \u201cno confusion.\u201d While the sexual harassment he\u2019s experienced likely pales in comparison with my own experiences, it doesn\u2019t negate his. He attended a holiday party with me a few years back, and I recall a complete stranger squeezing his bicep while cooing, \u201cI wish my husband would go to the gym.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, sis. Keep your hands, feet and all other objects to yourself because I can\u2019t control my reflexes and your health depends on it. (That\u2019s the rule we learned in kindergarten, right?)\n\nIn short, with all that women have to deal with in the workplace\u2014and I\u2019m not even speaking to the unimaginable horrors endured by working-class women and domestic workers who often have no recourse\u2014I can assure you that the majority of us really aren\u2019t interested in entertaining anyone\u2019s advances while there, whether the pursuer is Michael B. Jordan or Flavor Flav, at least not on the clock. The men who know better really aren\u2019t about that life, either.\n\nBe friendly, not flirty. Be fierce, not forceful.

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

Budd: My point is, I\u2019m the bouncer ... and there ain\u2019t nobody out there to bounce!\n\nThis passage, of course, is from Kill Bill: Vol. 2. It occurs toward the beginning of the movie as Budd, who was once a world-renowned assassin and now works as a bouncer in a seedy and barren strip club, is attempting to explain to Larry (his boss) why he\u2019s habitually late for work.\n\n\n\nIn turn, Larry, um, questions the logic of what Budd is saying:\n\nLarry Gomez: You\u2019re saying that the reason ... that you\u2019re not doing the job that I\u2019m ... paying you to do is ... that you don\u2019t have a job to do? Is that what you\u2019re saying? What are you trying to convince me of, exactly?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe back-and-forth starts at the 1:15 mark:\n\n\n\nI\u2019m reminded of this scene when reading and thinking and talking about some of the reactions to the Babe.net story on Aziz Ansari, which has become such a cultural touchstone that I\u2019m not even sure if \u201cviral\u201d is still an accurate description of its reach. Specifically, the pushback centered on the idea that men in general are unable to read body language and exist incapable of hearing and deciphering any gestures or words other than those expressed with a bullhorn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strain of pushback mirrors one of the most annoying and persistent criticisms of the #MeToo movement, where some men (and women) claim that this will ultimately result in a nation of men paralyzed with fear, not knowing whether saying \u201cHi\u201d constitutes assault and utterly unsure if having a lunch conversation with a co-worker who happens to be a woman now means that their names will be hashtagged before they\u2019ve even finished their junior bacon cheeseburgers.\n\n\n\nThis, of course, is fucking dumb\u2014and as Danielle Butler articulated last week, at least as hysterical as the mythical #MeToo \u201chysterics\u201d they\u2019re attempting to decry. But it\u2019s also a fucking lie. No man is that fucking stupid to believe that the only safe way to interact with women now is to not interact with women now. Or that, since it\u2019s impossible to gauge interest (or lack thereof) in sexual activity through body language, the only way to fuck now is with flashcards.\n\nAnd I can confidently say that none of the men making these internet arguments are that fucking stupid. Because if they were, they wouldn\u2019t know how to use the internet. Because they\u2019d be too dumb to know the difference between a laptop and a watermelon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s happening here is men (and, again, some women) desperately and vehemently attempting to convince the entire world that we (men) are pervasively dumb\u2014that our stupidity is static and our brains are filled with sugar-free funnel cakes.\n\nTo be fair, this isn\u2019t exactly new. I\u2019m not quite sure if the popular sitcom trope of the meathead man and his patient and smarter (and much younger) wife existed first or if that was already such a prevalent thought that the trope just reflected it. Either way, both predate what\u2019s happening today. But it has never really made much sense, especially since those who subscribe to this belief also seem to be the same people advocating for men to be the indubitable heads of households. We can\u2019t be dumb as rocks and the most effective Dear Leaders. That\u2019s just not how that works (unless, of course, your name happens to be Trump).\n\nWhat I think is happening is that if you do a good-enough job convincing others that you\u2019re stupid, people\u2019s expectations of you will lower. You\u2019ll be asked to do fewer things, and demands of your behavior will be scaled back. It\u2019s like the teen who mows the lawn terribly with the hope that he\u2019s so bad at it that his parents never ask him to do it again. They try to tell us that our behavior needs to change, and we pull back and say, \u201cDUH, BUT I CAN\u2019T READ BODY LANGUAGE, ONLY MAXIM MAGAZINE,\u201d and hope that they give up on us and continue the status quo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Kill Bill: Vol. 2, Budd eventually meets his demise when he underestimates the intelligence and ruthlessness of Elle Driver, who hid a black mamba in a briefcase full of cash and watched as it bit, poisoned and eventually killed him. His death doesn\u2019t really have any connection to Aziz Ansari, #MeToo or the eternal efforts to convince everyone that we (men) are imbeciles.

On Wednesday, the magazine announced that \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d\u2014the victims of sexual harassment and assault who have come forward to tell their stories\u2014had earned the distinction of being its Person of the Year for 2017.\n\nTime Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show in an interview Wednesday morning that this year\u2019s #MeToo movement represented the \u201cfastest-moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades, and it began with individual acts of courage by women and some men too.\u201d\n\nTime\u2019s article features an array of women and men from all backgrounds and walks of life. There are the celebrities who initially grabbed headlines, like actress Ashley Judd, who was the first to go on the record to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. But there is also a hospital worker, an engineer, a strawberry picker, a housekeeper, an entrepreneur\u2014all of whom had their portraits taken for the piece.\n\nWhile prominent public figures like Judd and Terry Crews drove the conversation about sexual harassment and sexual assault to the forefront, the article is arguably most effective in showing the scope of a pervasive, global problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time writes:\n\nThe women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City\u2019s regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They\u2019re part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.\n\nTime magazine says its team spent six weeks compiling stories of harassment and assault, interviewing dozens of men and women in a windowless room in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. Following Time\u2019s announcement of the Person of the Year, Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent for the outlet, noted on Twitter that the piece was \u201cconceived, reported and written by women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was fact-checked by women,\u201d Alter added. \u201cThe video was shot and edited by women. The layout and photo spread were designed by women.\u201d\n\nA conspicuous absence on Time magazine\u2019s front cover, though, is that of Tarana Burke, who originally used the phrase \u201cme too\u201d to build solidarity among survivors of sexual abuse more than a decade ago. Burke is featured in both the promotional video for the story and within the article itself.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment does bring shame,\u201d Burke told the magazine. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTime does note that people of color\u2014as well as immigrants, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people\u2014face \u201cmany types of dread\u201d when they come forward to report sexual abuse.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they raised their voices, would they be fired?\u201d the article notes. \u201cWould their communities turn against them? Would they be killed?\u201d\n\nAmong the people of color whose experiences are profiled are Crystal Washington, one of seven employees of the Plaza Hotel who have filed a sexual harassment suit against the hotel; and Adama Iwu, a lobbyist who organized an open letter exposing harassment in the California Legislature. Terry Crews, the most recognizable man to come forward with sexual harassment claims, is also shown prominently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody questions the predator,\u201d Crews told Time. \u201cYou know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, \u2018No more.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, not everyone who\u2019s come forward with their stories has been embraced. Anita Hill is rightfully mentioned as a predecessor to the #MeToo movement who did not receive the same groundswell of public support. And among the most conspicuous celebrity absences may be that of actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who is among the dozens of women who came forward with stories of Weinstein\u2019s predatory and harassing behavior toward them\u2014and the only one whose story he specifically disputed.\n\nAnd it turns out, Donald Trump, who claimed he would \u201cprobably\u201d have been Time person of the year, did get a mention\u2014as the sexual harasser in chief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, cited the president as a reason she decided to blow the whistle on her former employer.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\u201d Fowler told Time. \u201cI felt like I had to take action.\u201d\n\nRead more at Time.", "keywords": ["breakers", "women", "come", "forward", "men", "names", "person", "movement", "told", "harassment", "silence", "sexual", "magazine", "article"], "polarity": 0.20022434163059163, "subjectivity": 0.4746978715728715},

The Hollywood Reporter explains:\n\nWith negotiations for the fifth season ongoing, sources say Ellis Ross feels that if she isn\u2019t brought up to Anderson\u2019s level, she may opt to appear in fewer episodes to make up the disparity by guesting on another show. The tactic has split opinions within Time\u2019s Up, with some worried that it\u2019s more a retreat than a forward-looking solution (fitting in extra work isn\u2019t always feasible, and often an actress wouldn\u2019t earn as much guesting as she would as a network star). A network source says a new deal will significantly increase her compensation and cautioned that Anderson and Ellis Ross\u2019 roles aren\u2019t equal given that he has been attached to Black-ish from the start and is an executive producer. Still, until a few weeks ago, this type of candid conversation would never have taken place outside an actress\u2019 agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, it\u2019s unclear what \u201csignificantly less\u201d means, but another egregious example discussed at the Time\u2019s Up table was the pay difference between actress Michelle Williams and her co-star, Mark Wahlberg, for their recent film All the Money in the World. In that case, Wahlberg was paid nearly 10 times more than Williams, taking home $5 million, compared with Williams\u2019 $625,000.\n\nThat Ross\u2019 pay gap with Anderson was brought up in the same conversation could mean they\u2019re facing a similarly severe pay disparity.\n\nBoth Ross and Anderson have starred on Black-ish since the show started running on ABC in 2014, and have received multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for their work on the series. Of the two, however, Ross is the only one to have taken home an award. In 2016 she became the first black woman in 35 years to win a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy or musical TV series.", "keywords": ["tracee", "ross", "pay", "significantly", "paid", "hollywood", "reveals", "times", "blackish", "meeting", "timesup", "actress", "williams", "equal", "anderson", "gap", "laughs"], "polarity": 0.14481951871657753, "subjectivity": 0.40148172905525853},

Specifically, she wants me to take her vitamins, which is why a month\u2019s supply of multivitamins from her company, Movita Organics, sits on my desk. The glass bottle boasts that they are made with organic fruit, vegetables and herbs, whole-food vitamins and minerals, and are gluten-free, non-GMO and allergen-free for shellfish and nuts. But for me, the biggest selling point was that I could take them on an empty stomach, which I have been, every morning for the past two weeks.\n\nHow do I feel? Pretty damn good, for someone who averages five hours of sleep per night.\n\nI\u2019m guessing this proprietary blend must be where Tonya Lewis Lee gets the energy to keep so many balls in the air\u2014and look great doing it. After all, the attorney, film and television producer, writer, health advocate, public speaker, blogger and now vitamin entrepreneur is also mother to two grown children and has been married to prolific and legendary director Spike Lee since 1993.\n\nAnd Movita isn\u2019t even her only current project: Aside from her own writing projects, her production company, Tonik Productions, is currently in distribution talks for its critically acclaimed film Monster, which premiered at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival and stars Jeffrey Wright and Jennifer Hudson. It\u2019s just one of multiple film and television projects the company has pending; and then, of course, she\u2019s also executive producer (and rumored inspiration) for Netflix\u2019s successful serial reboot of her husband\u2019s first feature film, She\u2019s Gotta Have It.\n\nAdd to that her health-and-wellness blog, Healthy You Now, and her numerous speaking engagements around the country on issues of women\u2019s and infant health, and you\u2019ve got one very full, very multifaceted life. Here at The Glow Up, all we want to know is: How does she do it? Lewis Lee graciously took time out from her busy schedule to tell us:\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny, because I think sometimes for people it can sound like, \u201cOh, she has so many different things.\u201d But for me, they all come out of the same place, meaning that they come from a place of really wanting to ultimately tell stories around who we are as a people\u2014and particularly black people\u2014but also, black people living in an integrated world. And the health piece to me is so clear because I believe that we\u2019re all here for a purpose and a reason, and you can\u2019t really fulfill your purpose or your reason if you don\u2019t have your health. And so, for me, the vitamins are a way to continue the conversation with women around how to live your best life, how to be as healthy as you possibly can be, and to keep those conversations and stories going, as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee\u2019s recent venture into the vitamin market is part of advancing that conversation. Movita Organics launched with its women\u2019s multivitamin (which retails at a competitive $39.95 per bottle for a incomparable list of benefits), but has several other products ready for market, including a prenatal vitamin, B3 and B12, as well as a hair, skin and nails formulation we can\u2019t wait to get our hands on.\n\nBut if a high-end multivitamin seems a trivial pursuit in comparison with the real health crises facing our communities, Lewis Lee is well-versed on those issues as well, traveling the country to engage with and inform women of all backgrounds about ways to achieve optimal health for themselves, their families and their communities:\n\n\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve done when I have gone and spoken at different outlets is to bring together people from that particular community to talk about the issues; about what are the barriers to optimal health in their communities, and how can we seek to make the situation better? ... Because I do think that when you share information\u2014even if what\u2019s happening in my community is a little different [from] what\u2019s going on in yours\u2014that shared information can be helpful. Again, because it\u2019s not just an individual choice; it is about our community as well, and getting our communities to support healthy lifestyles, especially in this onslaught that we are dealing with our government right now. So I hope to go offline as well, and bring people together to have these conversations and try to make our communities as healthy as they can be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Keith Major\n\nNow that she\u2019s moving into making health-based products, Lewis Lee is garnering obvious comparisons to other lifestyle mavens\u2014her blog has even been called \u201cthe black Goop.\u201d But Lewis Lee is clear that her mission is to create and cultivate a healthy lifestyle culture made for us, by us:\n\n\n\nWhen I initially started my blog, Healthy You Now, the idea was to provide a platform that was creating content that would help women find answers and ... ways to live a better, healthier lifestyle. And we also were trying to create a community of women, because I think that a lot of times we feel like we\u2019re out here on our own, trying to figure these issues out. But when you hear other people\u2019s journeys, it\u2019s helpful to know that you\u2019re not alone ...\n\nIt is about a community of women with tools to help them live their best lives. And as women of color, we certainly deserve and need space for ourselves as well ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious undertaking, but clearly, Lewis Lee is no stranger to ambition. Neither is she the prototypical \u201cHollywood wife\u201d; even during the years she focused on raising her family in her native New York, she always kept her own career at what she calls a \u201csimmer.\u201d But while it would be easy to assume that she\u2019s gotta have it all, Lewis Lee chuckles at the concept:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m a believer that you can have it all, but not necessarily all at the same time. And it\u2019s hard; I am very fortunate in that I married someone who was able to provide while we were raising our children. I did keep working, but ... I made the choice that my children were going to come first, and I was able to work around what worked for them. [But] I always had a vision that by the time my son\u2014who\u2019s my youngest\u2014graduated from high school, I\u2019d still be a relatively young woman, and I could really go hard in my career. ... I was able to do that, and once they were out of the house, I was then able to shift gears and go really hard, which is really amazing. And I am so grateful to be able to be in that position. So I would say to women: You have to make choices that work for your family. You have to make your choices, but I do believe as women, no matter what your circumstances, you have to have something for yourself. And even if you have to keep it at simmer\u2014if you can\u2019t do it 100 percent\u2014you should do something so that when the time comes ... you can shift gears and go 100 percent... I think that for our own self-esteem, we do have to be engaged in working at something other than our children, so that when they do grow up\u2014and they do grow up faster than we think\u2014you\u2019ve got something for yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee credits great partnerships in every area of her life with her ability to juggle it all, as well as the ability to pivot when things aren\u2019t working out. But most of all, she thinks the secret to her ongoing motivation and success is figuring out what she loves to do, and continuing to do it:", "keywords": ["tonya", "great", "film", "women", "lewis", "vitamins", "motivator", "able", "health", "mama", "healthy", "really", "community", "lee", "multifaceted"], "polarity": 0.22339749536178108, "subjectivity": 0.5181294725682479},

There is no way they were threatened by anything. He was only trying to get away.\u201d\n\nThe encounter started when officers pulled over Harmon for riding a bicycle without a light. How does a man wind up dead from a traffic stop over a bicycle?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, Salt Lake City officials insist that the shooting was justified because officers feared for their lives. Of course. It is completely natural to fear someone who is running in the opposite direction from you. Never mind that footage clearly shows that another officer had deployed his Taser at the same time Fox fatally shot Harmon.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the district attorney\u2019s office claimed that Harmon said, \u201cI\u2019ll cut you,\u201d then turned and faced officers with a knife as he was running.\n\nThe video seems to tell another story, however, since Harmon cannot be heard making that threat and never appears to turn toward officers before he is shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Video contains graphic footage.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was scared. All he did was run,\u201d Adriane Harmon, another niece, told The Guardian. \u201cIt hurts. \u2026 They said, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you,\u2019 and they shot him three times. He\u2019s just moaning on the ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Tribune, when officers stopped Harmon for his alleged traffic infraction, Harmon apparently gave the officer a name that did not have a match in the police database. The officer again asked Harmon to spell his last name, and according to the district attorney\u2019s report, Harmon gave \u201ca couple of different names.\u201d\n\nFootage shows Harmon spelling his name quietly as the officer asked for clarification several times. Eventually the officer went back to his squad car, and Harmon admitted to the officer that he may find a warrant out for a felony charge.\n\nThe officer called for backup, and two more officers arrived on the scene.\n\nEventually, the officer did find out that Harmon had arrest warrants out, including one for a felony related to an aggravated assault charge. The warrant was issued in April after Harmon did not show up for sentencing after pleading guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also another warrant out for Harmon regarding his not complying with probation requirements after pleading guilty in a misdemeanor drug-possession case, the records show.\n\nAnd so, officers informed Harmon that he was going to be arrested under those warrants.\n\nAs officers started to detain him, Harmon was heard pleading with officers, apparently not wanting to go to jail, and he appeared to be crying. And that\u2019s when he bolted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe officer who originally stopped Harmon drew his stun gun, but the other officer, Fox, decided that three shots at a fleeing suspect were appropriate.\n\nFox told investigators that he saw a knife in Harmon\u2019s hand with the blade exposed and believed that another officer was in danger\u2019s way.\n\nAll of that is, again, not clear in the video.\n\nWhat is decidedly clear is Fox shouting, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking shoot you!\u201d before firing at Harmon\u2019s back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the fact that Harmon was critically wounded, officers still handcuffed him, though they attempted to give him first aid at the scene.\n\nInvestigators say they found a knife on the ground.\n\nAs The Guardian notes, Salt Lake City had previously been praised for its \u201cde-escalation\u201d training, and the department is known for giving out \u201cde-escalation awards.\u201d However, such de-escalation seems not to have come into play in Harmon\u2019s case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe police are going to stick together no matter if it\u2019s wrong or right,\u201d Antoinette Harmon, Harmon\u2019s older sister, told The Guardian. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about black lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat officer disregarded his de-escalation training,\u201d Lex Scott, a local Black Lives Matter organizer, told The Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s just brutal. How could anyone with eyes and ears believe that that officer was justified?\u201d\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department declined to answer any questions about the case, but Police Chief Mike Brown released a statement: \u201cWe trust the process and support the decision from District Attorney Sim Gill. I believe our officers have the training and judgement and ability to make split-second decisions in dynamic situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Salt Lake Tribune and The Guardian.", "keywords": ["harmon", "knife", "justified", "fatally", "officer", "guardian", "shows", "officers", "shooting", "lake", "man", "black", "harmons", "utah", "salt", "video", "flee", "told", "district"], "polarity": -0.019805194805194798, "subjectivity": 0.4253463203463203},

My 5-year-old nephew has apparently reached the age where bald curiosity meets peak candor, because he\u2019s taken to asking me this question every time we see each other, as we did a few days ago. My response is always the same: \u201cHoney, why do you want me to be married?\u201d\n\nMore than once he\u2019s said shyly, while hanging off my neck, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d\n\nOuch. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not alone. I have you, and your sister, and Mommy and Daddy, and Grammy and Papa ... \u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think you should get married,\u201d he earnestly insists.\n\nOK, enough philosophy; time to get real with this kid: \u201cWell, what would I need to be married?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, he always screws up his adorable little face, as if I\u2019ve asked him the meaning of life ... or whether he\u2019s brushed his teeth yet.\n\n\u201cHmm ... a husband?\u201d\n\nEnd of discussion, thank God.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day can be an embarrassment of riches rich with embarrassment for single people, whether it\u2019s a 5-year-old deeply concerned about you dying alone, or a well-meaning, happily married colleague who suggests that you do a story on the statistical undesirability of black, single women in online dating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd no matter how much one\u2019s version of alone differs from lonely, if I\u2019m honest, it always stings, at least a little.\n\nBut then I think back to last Valentine\u2019s Day, when I was a freelance creative trying to figure out my next big chess move. Only a week before, I\u2019d moved back to my hometown after a 24-year absence\u2014in part because the man I\u2019d long been dating long-distance lived there.\n\nBut instead of feeling at home, I was sad, scared, set adrift, waiting for a sign, and starting to have the growing suspicion that my \u201cboyfriend\u201d liked me much better when we weren\u2019t in the same area code. That suspicion would prove true months later, when an out-of-town friend spotted him on Tinder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, I was lonely\u2014far lonelier than I am now, when I\u2019m basically married to my job (a concept I thought a bit too advanced for my nephew). But somewhere between trying to meet a man halfway and getting The Glow Up up and running, I went missing.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether it was my constant attempts to be accommodating, the constant grind of trying to learn on my feet, or just the constant pressure to be all things all the time and never quite feeling that I was measuring up, but I allowed myself to get lost in the mix. I checked out, and I must admit, checking back in is harder than I thought.\n\nAnd I know I\u2019m not alone; every day I engage with the incredible growing community in The Glow Up Facebook group, and see myself reflected in the women there, all of us trying to stay present and connected\u2014even when we\u2019re not quite sure what to connect ourselves to anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I\u2019ve matured, I\u2019ve realized, as many of us do, that love is a choice; a choice we must make over and over again\u2014sometimes in spite of everything else. But all too often, our concept of love remains fixed to factors that we have very little choice in at all, like waiting to get \u201cchose\u201d or finding someone \u201cworthy\u201d of choosing.\n\nWhy do we do that? Is it because it\u2019s easier to throw our fates to the wind than to choose ourselves, even if no one else does?\n\nI can\u2019t currently claim loneliness; my life is too full of deadlines, and meetings, and personalities, and way too much stuff. I also don\u2019t think about marriage much these days\u2014there are lots of reasons I\u2019m not married, and some of them are entirely on me. And, thankfully, I can say without bitterness that I don\u2019t even miss my ex. When I think back on him and the men who preceded him, I feel no regret. (I don\u2019t feel much of anything, to be honest.) There is no \u201cone who got away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also know firsthand what a difference a year can make.\n\nBut damn if I don\u2019t miss myself. I gotta find that woman.

I would never knowingly cause fear or harm to anyone.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, was Simmons\u2019 statement in response to accusations from model Keri Claussen Khalighi, who earlier this month accused Simmons of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old.\n\nBut according to Lumet, Simmons\u2019 statement could not be further from the truth she knows, a truth she detailed in the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLumet accused Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, of taking her to his home against her wishes after she accepted a ride.\n\nI got into the car with you. The driver began to drive. I assumed you knew where I lived, because you had sent me 250 balloons, but I gave the driver my address on 19th Street and 2nd Avenue. You said to the driver: \u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand, so I said: \u201cRussell?\u201d I said, again, to the driver: \u201c19th Street.\u201d Again you said to the driver: \u201cNo. \u201d Then, the car doors locked. It was loud. The noise made me jump. I didn\u2019t recognize you at that moment. It was disorienting. It was disorienting. I say it twice, now, because you said \u201cNo\u201d twice, then. I couldn\u2019t open the doors. I couldn\u2019t open the windows. The car was moving. The driver did not stop. He did not take me to 19th Street. He took me to your apartment. I didn\u2019t try to kick the windows out. I didn\u2019t punch or kick. I didn\u2019t say \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d My voice left me after the second \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLumet continued, recalling how she ended up doing what she was told, simply because she was not sure if the situation would turn violent:\n\nYou moved me into a bedroom. I said \u201cWait.\u201d You said nothing. I made the trade in my mind. I thought \u201cjust keep him calm and you\u2019ll get home.\u201d Maybe another person would have thought differently, or not made the trade. It was dark, but not pitch dark. You closed the door. At that point, I simply did what I was told. There was penetration. At one point you were only semi-erect and appeared frustrated. Angry? I remember being afraid that you would deem that my fault and become violent. I did not know if you were angry, but I was afraid that you were. I desperately wanted to keep the situation from escalating. I wanted you to feel that I was not going to be difficult. I wanted to stay as contained as I could. You told me to turn over on my stomach. You said something about a part of my body. You did not ejaculate inside me. When it was over, I got my clothes and quickly went down in the elevator by myself. You didn\u2019t try to stop me. I went home in a taxi. I was grateful to be secure in my home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe famed screenwriter finished her story, recalling how she strove for normalcy since that day when encountering Simmons, and all the events that were tainted by his presence and his silence about the encounter:\n\n\u201cI have built a life in the past 25 years, and a reputation in my industry. I need no one to have this visualization of me. I will, like the others, lose work because of this. I realize how privileged I am to be able to risk that. I have children. I\u2019m aware that every mistake, act of thoughtlessness, hypocrisy or cruelty I\u2019ve committed in my 50 years will be excavated, and they\u2019ll see all of it. There is so much guilt, and so much shame. There is an excruciating internal reckoning. As a woman of color, I cannot express how wrenching it is to write this about a successful man of color. Again, shame about who I was years ago, choices made years ago. In this very moment, I feel a pang to protect your daughters. I don\u2019t think you are inclined to protect mine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLumet\u2019s article caused a stir across social media and news platforms, prompting a quick response from Simmons, who announced that he would be stepping aside from his companies.\n\n\u201cThe companies will now be run by a new and diverse generation of extraordinary executives who are moving the culture and consciousness forward,\u201d Simmons said in a statement. \u201cI will convert the studio for yogic science into a not-for-profit center of learning and healing. As for me, I will step aside and commit myself to continuing my personal growth, spiritual learning and above all to listening.\u201d\n\nAs to Lumet\u2019s actual accusations, Simmons claims that \u201cher memory of that evening is very different\u201d from his.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologize,\u201d he said, in what I think was meant to be an apology.\n\nRead more at the Hollywood Reporter.", "keywords": ["didnt", "wanted", "hornes", "19th", "violation", "lumet", "russell", "simmons", "granddaughter", "statement", "car", "filmmaker", "lena", "told", "street", "jenny", "sexual", "driver"], "polarity": -0.016161616161616172, "subjectivity": 0.5240700920209117},

Five years of building up black communities. Five years of experiencing police repression. Five years of centering black stories as the way we honor both the dead and the living. We took to the Oscar stage because Black Lives Matter refuses to stop fighting and loving and pushing for the dignity of black people everywhere.\n\nThere is an African proverb: \u201cUntil the lion tells the story, the hunter will always be the hero.\u201d In no place is that more true than American filmmaking. Each year, the Academy Awards are a celebration of hunters and a silencing of lions: a glorification of the lion\u2019s slaughter through the centering of white film and stories. These stories both create and feed white fantasy; they enable Eurocentrism and entitlement with carefully constructed, beautifully written tales about white love, war, domination, family, power and every imaginable interaction, both real and imagined, that affirms for white filmgoers that everything is, indeed, about them, and the stories remind people of color of their insignificance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis practice came to a head in 2016 when #OscarsSoWhite protested that every single Oscar nominee was white and most of the films made that year were white-centered. This in a nation where people of color were almost 40 percent of the population and were projected to outnumber whites by 2050; in a world where people of color were the vast majority\u2014whites constitute only about 16 percent of the global population; and at a time where people of color were unapologetically struggling for racial justice through #BlackLivesMatter and #NoDAPL.\n\nThe 2016 awards marked the taking of a side; it was a declaration that filmmakers were hunters. But the proverb about lions and hunters is not simply one of diversity and inclusion; it is ultimately a proverb about power. It is about whose stories get told and how the telling of stories both mirrors and embeds societal power.\n\nLions telling stories is about reframing who is the hero or shero. Lions telling stories is about reminding folks that there is a savanna undiscovered by hunters, that there are relationships between lions, between men and women, children and adults; there is a search for food and the building of shelter. For black people, there is love, not only war. Stories by and for black people are not fantasy. There is no time for escapism\u2014only radical imagining and freedom dreams for Wakandas and Wrinkles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStories are also about affirming our existence. In a world that tries to erase our presence, our stories are a claiming of space. They tell us that we are not alone or crazy, that we are not who they tell us we are. When black people tell stories, we also uplift black reality. We retell the stories of black struggle, not through the creation of a messianic leader or, worse, white saviors, but through the masses of black people who made up the civil rights movement in Selma.\n\nWe remind folks that when police steal the lives of our people, they are stealing fathers and sons who have love and laughter away from their daughters, mothers and uncles, as they did with Oscar Grant in Fruitvale Station. When black people tell stories, there is the amplification of black realities\u2014of realities yet untold except by those who live them.\n\nWhere are the films about stopping Los Angeles, the largest jailer in the world, from incarcerating people in black and poor communities? Where are the films about the 55,000 houseless people, the 1 in 22 black men, who live on the streets of Los Angeles? Where are the stories of Wakiesha Wilson, Ezell Ford, Redel Jones, Kisha Michael, Kendrec McDade, Anthony Weber or any of the 400 people killed in the last five years by police in Los Angeles County? Where are the stories of black domestic abuse survivors like Marissa Alexander, who dared to stand up to her abuser and was imprisoned for it in Florida, the same state where George Zimmerman was protected by \u201cStand your ground\u201d law as he stalked and murdered 17-year-old Trayvon Martin?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen black people\u2019s stories are told, we need not be perfect to be heroes; we can be complicated, broken and brilliant Killmongers. We can stand at the intersections of black, queer, revolutionary writer identities. When lions tell stories, they are messy and complicated and beautiful and ugly all at the same time. And every story shapes and is shaped by black realities.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network took to the Oscar stage because we are \u201crooting for everybody black\u201d\u2014because through black filmmakers, our stories are told without making the hunters the heroes.\n\nMelina Abdullah is professor and chair of Pan-African studies at Cal State L.A.

At the conclusion of the painful year that was 2017, various women of assorted celebrity backgrounds assembled to simultaneously weaponize their privilege and latch onto the momentum and resurgence of Tarana Burke\u2019s \u201cMe Too\u201d movement. This gave birth to a new movement on Jan. 1, 2018: #TimesUp.\n\n#TimesUp, so far, seeks to arm women with the legal means to fight against assault and abuse in the workplace and is making tangible headway on pay disparities for women across different career fields.\n\nThe movement is still in its infancy and is most certainly not without fault, blemish or missteps. But the fervor, passion and audacious spirits of the women behind it\u2014particularly black women and other women of color\u2014burn so brightly that it\u2019s clear to me (as it should be to many others) that this movement is not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n\n\nAnd this same energy has been brought into 2018.\n\nHowever.\n\nFor every action on this planet, there is a reaction. Its opposite. There\u2019s always gonna be some Reverse Flash asshole waiting in the cut for the Flash to trip over his feet and fuck up so he can strike. Always.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nAnd such is the case with Margaret Atwood.\n\nTo elaborate, Atwood was recently the subject of ire when she and many other (white) female writers came out in some head-ass letter last year to defend Steven Galloway, a former professor at the University of British Columbia and former chair of its creative writing program, against accusations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtwood faced justifiable rage and backlash, and because of her presumably, and simultaneously, bruised and swollen pride, she opted to write her own op-ed about not supporting \u201cwitch hunts\u201d and being a \u201cbad feminist.\u201d I opted to chuckle (like an adult would do over a wayward and insolent toddler) when I saw her op-ed, mainly because in her hubris-fueled defense of herself, she bit off the terminology of a black woman\u2014who in this case is Roxane Gay.\n\nThis intrigues me because it punctuates a long and ugly history of white feminists co-opting (if not outright stealing) black feminist theory and terminology, and is also qwhite funny if we remember that Atwood is the creator of the (white) dystopic, feminist novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. Why is that funny, Clarkisha?\n\nWell, let\u2019s see:\n\n1. If you know anything about The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Atwood\u2019s recent white feminist comments or her appropriation of \u201cbad feminist\u201d should not surprise you.\n\nAtwood\u2019s public white feminist retort is oddly timely considering the so-called feminism of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and the fact that it is currently doing its little jog around the award circuit. Now, many assumed that because she is the creator of this alleged \u00fcber-feminist work, her comments apparently came from left field. That they were unexpected. That there was no way to predict that kind of heel turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd ... I call shenanigans. Or, rather, bullshit.\n\nBecause to even have the privilege or unmitigated gall to be shocked by her comments, you would have had to assume that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is, without a doubt, an unapologetically feminist text. And of course, you would be wrong on both accounts, for one very big reason:\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale is not a feminist text. It is a white feminist text. And this is specifically the case because it imagines a white-woman dystopia by stealing and reappropriating the historical injustices done to black women in America by way of slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know. I just said a mouthful. But stay with me.\n\nThe premise of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is dystopic in nature and, at its core, imagines a world where white women are stripped of all their modern rights\u2014the chief among them being autonomy over their own bodies. But as you read more into what makes this universe specifically dystopic for white women, it starts to sound a bit familiar.\n\nAs this wonderful piece by Ana Cottle of The Establishment elaborates, white women find themselves being raped; being herded around like cattle and property; being forced to breed; being barred from coming and going as they please without some special note from their master, and adopting the name of said master as a mark of ownership; and being beaten or killed if they do not comply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a nightmare, for sure, but it is a nightmare that black women have experienced firsthand in this country and still experience in some places abroad. And ironically enough, we are erased from Atwood\u2019s fictional and narrative hellscape just so that our struggles can be cosplayed by white women.\n\nYep, that\u2019s right. Putting on some long, red garment and a fancy white hat does not suddenly make the struggle of being both black and female yours, but that is exactly what Atwood has been allowed to get away with for this long. Still. The adaptation and its creators sought to address this pressing issue ... by sprinkling some black characters into the supporting cast. But considering that the main black female character swiftly vanishes to Canada (and is barely heard from again), I would say that the adaptation has laughably failed in that regard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, and Atwood\u2019s blatant disregard for history, truth, intersectional feminism and black women, should have been the biggest hint to Atwood fans that ya girl is not really ya girl. But in case you still have lingering doubts, there is one more reason that Atwood\u2019s \u201cdouble cross\u201d should have been expected all along:\n\n2. In the context of #MeToo and #TimesUp, white women have shown that they are all too comfortable with defaulting to\u2014and protecting\u2014(white) patriarchy.\n\nWhat many of you are finding out as this #MeToo and #TimesUp conversation continues is that women like Atwood are very much frozen in a different era of (white) feminism (think second or third wave), when it was considered taboo or \u201cnot as important\u201d to discuss things like sexual assault and coerced consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlainly speaking, this disconnect puts Atwood and her ilk in unfamiliar territory. And since the height of her feminism rested on theft from black feminists and rebranding it as her own praxis, she\u2019s probably not sure how to adjust to a big change like #MeToo or #TimesUp, and thereby defaulted to the next-best thing:\n\nWhiteness. Or, in this case, white patriarchy.\n\nThere are many levels to this, just as there are to the optics of a gaggle of \u201cfeminist\u201d white women openly caping for an accused white male sexual assaulter. Internalized misogyny is probably the first thing to come to mind, but that would be letting Atwood and women like her off too easy, since you\u2019d be assuming that Atwood was simply ignorant and misguided in her response\u2014which is not the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is well-established that Atwood subscribes to white feminist politics. And the goal of white feminism itself is to simply emancipate white women from white men. Meaning, in simpler terms, that white women want to be able to get out from under white patriarchy (and throw the rest of us under the bus to accomplish this), but do not necessarily want to get rid of it, because doing so would destabilize white supremacy\u2014and then boom! Suddenly, even they would be left with no power or privilege when the dust settled.\n\nLet\u2019s put it this way: Tiffany wants to get her neck from under Chet\u2019s boot AND have a shot at getting her OWN boot. Not get rid of the boot entirely. Tif just wants a fair shot, y\u2019all.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo perhaps that\u2019s why the backlash from all these Margarets, Caitlins, Susans, Tiffanys and Lenas is so strong. Sure, #TimesUp and #MeToo do white women a service by taking out abusive and predatory trash and keeping them out of harm\u2019s way. But if Atwood\u2019s defense of Galloway, or Dunham\u2019s defense of Murray Miller, from rebuke is any indication, they are implying\u2014whether they realize it or not\u2014that these movements are \u201cdoing too much\u201d in coming for people they like or the people they have aligned themselves with in order to access as much adjacent power as possible. Which, in this case, happens to be white men\u2014their ticket to said power.\n\n\n\nAtwood and the rest of these women recognize that the abuse being dragged into the light is problematic and emblematic of a larger, systematic issue within white supremacy, but they don\u2019t want to expose all of that if it\u2019s gonna a) take down all of their powerful friends in high places or b) be the thing that disassembles a system that they\u2019d rather keep around as long as they have equal access to it and remain unharmed by it.\n\nIn short: Whiteness is a HELLUVA drug. And Atwood and women like her are most certainly hooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is why it would be to the benefit of fans shaken by her white feminist comments to cease the unfounded shock and confront the realities and contradictions of their continued support of her. In the interim, that time would be better spent lifting the black feminist voices that Atwood has continually stolen from AND amplify all the black feminists and other feminists of color who denounced her support of Galloway to begin with. Instead of, in this case, allowing her to publicly vent about being a shitty white feminist.\n\nBut, you know, that would make too much sense, since it would require you to give a fuck about black women.", "keywords": ["handmaids", "white", "women", "margaret", "case", "feminism", "espousal", "feminist", "womans", "shouldnt", "black", "atwood", "beliefs", "surprise", "tale", "atwoods"], "polarity": 0.07619165211706647, "subjectivity": 0.39545964778008963},

It will tell the story of Nanisca (Davis), general of the all-female military unit known as the Amazons, and her daughter Nawi (Nyong\u2019o), who together fought the French and neighboring tribes who violated their honor, enslaved their people, and threatened to destroy everything they\u2019ve lived for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmm ... am I the only one who wants to see this, like, tomorrow?\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more: While the story originated from actress Maria Bello and producer Cathy Schulman\u2019s Welle Entertainment, the film will be produced by Juvee Productions, helmed by Davis and her husband, Julian Tennon, who stated:\n\nThe Woman King has the potential to be a game changer for women of color everywhere. Viola and our team at JuVee are beyond excited to partner with Sony/TriStar to bring these fierce women to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while this sounds like a story that deserves to be told regardless of the black-ass blockbuster currently dominating the box office, the impact of Marvel\u2019s latest success isn\u2019t lost on Schulman, who issued this statement:\n\nBlack Panther just showed us how the power of imagination and lore could reveal a world without gender and racial stereotypes. The Woman King will tell one of history\u2019s greatest forgotten stories from the real world in which we live, where an army of African warrior women staved off slavery, colonialism and intertribal warfare to unify a nation.\n\nYeah ... that sounds like something we need to see.", "keywords": ["king", "know", "film", "women", "woman", "wakanda", "nyongo", "black", "lupita", "panther", "world", "davis", "viola"], "polarity": 0.09814780457637601, "subjectivity": 0.4434693877551021},

In that brief moment of nonverbal communication, so much was conveyed. I, at least, understood that he wanted to touch my leg and, likely, my pussy\u2014and ole boy understood that he could.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where dudes get it twisted.\n\nMany men presume that it is OK to project onto women their sexual impulses and violence in physical ways. And patriarchy is mostly to blame.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode of patriarchal fuckery, actor-comedian Aziz Ansari was accused of hypersexual insensitivity. A now exhaustively debated expos\u00e9 published by online magazine Babe tells the story of an anonymous woman, given the pseudonym Grace, who claims to have found herself in a compromising position with the entertainer.\n\nAllegedly, after a speedy dinner date, the 22-year-old woman accompanied Ansari to his apartment and engaged in mutual oral sex with him, after being \u201cclawed,\u201d fingered and pounced upon\u2014and even after \u201cgetting up and moving and him following and sticking his fingers down [her] throat again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy her own admission, Grace acquiesced to sexual activity with Ansari, although she also acknowledges that she did not want to. The nature of what occurred between the two might not constitute sexual assault, but it puts the focus on fundamental glitches in modern dating and the normality of sexual misconduct.\n\nAnsari quickly issued a statement emphatically stating that \u201cby all indications [the encounter] was completely consensual,\u201d likely because everything appeared OK to him. He does not readily recognize his overtures as inappropriate. His claim absolves him of any intent to cause harm\u2014yet, by default, Grace is left to blame for her own distress.\n\nA male acquaintance of mine who has asked to remain anonymous stated, \u201cI would think that while the man is bearing all of the responsibility, she as a woman of agency and nonambiguity should advocate for herself and do what she has to in order to not let more bad happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an on-air attack, Wendy Williams blasted Grace: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just bite it and leave? \u2026 Why didn\u2019t you just grab your coat and leave, dummy?\u201d Williams asked scornfully.\n\nPerhaps they are all missing the point. Perhaps she liked him enough to renege on her usual self-standards. Perhaps she thought they\u2019d make a good couple with beautiful babies. Perhaps she was a groupie. Who knows? What we do know is that Grace was physically violated well before she took a position, well before she was browbeaten into giving a blow job and well before she gave in. Much like what happened in my situation, the point of consent was bypassed. None was given, but even worse, none was sought. It was a non-muthafuckin-factor.\n\nPeople must ask themselves why consent and communication are such an inconvenience.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must also ask why we continue to court a tradition in which boys will be boys and men will be men, no matter their indiscretions, while women are held to a five-star standard of awareness, action and responsibility. We are centuries invested in men\u2019s entitlement and audacity, and their retarded understanding of and disrespect for women\u2019s bodily rights. We live in a society where patriarchy is well-established and chronically practiced.\n\nAuthor Kiese Laymon, a professor of English and African-American studies at the University of Mississippi, asserted this idea in an interview:\n\nThe nation encourages boys and men to \u201cget\u201d sex from women by any means necessary. We are trained to believe \u201cno\u201d means \u201cnot yet.\u201d And most of all, we are also trained not to care [for] or respect the millions of women who have taught us that consent is integral to healthy sex. We allow ourselves to be trained by patriarchy and not radical black feminism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile many people are adamant about the conjecture that Grace should have acted differently, several publications\u2014particularly The Guardian and The New York Times\u2014ran pieces that also accused Grace of undermining the #MeToo movement and lamenting a failed come up. Scores of social media users have questioned her choice to perform and receive head\u2014and then still call foul.\n\nFar too many conflate Grace\u2019s actions with permission, but that is a function of patriarchy. Giving in is not synonymous with giving consent\u2014although sometimes it is entirely necessary. Being a black woman, in particular, has its cost. According to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, black women are affected by violence\u2014physical and sexual\u2014at a much higher rate than women of other races. Navigating common spaces as a black woman informs me that speaking up and taking agency is not always in my best interest. Revisiting my own situation proved this.\n\nMy date that long-ago night was amused by my subtle rejection. He thought I was being coy. He drove to the nearest Holiday Inn, parked, checked in, then returned for me, hotel key in hand. I finally found the words: \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his surprise, I rebuffed his expectation. To my surprise, his demeanor changed; his jawbone stiffened and he shut down. He drove off. We rode along a vacant Queens Boulevard in a thick silence. \u201cYou good?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bitches like you that always shit on a good nigga that treats her right, but give ain\u2019t-shit niggas the pussy.\u201d\n\nI asked to be let out of the car. He refused. At a red light, I opened the car door and let myself out\u2014he got out, too. He followed me, apologized and insisted that I stop being dramatic and get back in the car. I refused. He hauled back and slapped the shit out of me. His handprint was pressed into the side of my face\u2014literally. He rescued my body from the ground and whispered, \u201cGet the fuck in the car and don\u2019t say a word, before this shit gets worse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got back into the car. He drove back to the hotel. He fucked me. I did not utter a word, and neither did he. What wasn\u2019t said was thoroughly communicated.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, women can remain silent or vocal, stay put or take flight, hold out or put out, and still get screwed. Many times, our decision to do so boils down to matters of life or death, or both. Despite what Wendy Williams proclaims, it is far from easy to bite a man\u2019s penis and flee from the scene without bodily harm. Yet with all things considered, women are still culpable for placing themselves in bad situations\u2014men, not so much. That is patriarchy at work.\n\nThis worldview, this flawed attitude, is due for serious change. Pushing the narrative of consent and communication is not about an indictment of \u201call men\u201d but, rather, about the predatory practice of too many. Consent isn\u2019t about suppressing sexual energy; it\u2019s about respecting a woman\u2019s right to sexually engage on her terms. Communication cannot rest solely on a set of cues. And the work cannot be left solely to women and the #MeToo movement. The responsibility rests upon all of our shoulders, especially those of men.

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["blige", "hairstylist", "mary", "talks", "soul", "natural", "beautiful", "florence", "hiphop", "queen", "mudbound", "netflix", "unmaking", "davis", "lawrence", "hair", "j"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received further clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel. So, those in opposition to Stenberg playing the role weren\u2019t even protesting color-blind casting. They were just plain racist.

Another police officer has walked away without repercussions after gunning down a black man. On Friday morning, a St. Louis judge found now-former Police Officer Jason Stockley not guilty of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, a black motorist.\n\nSt. Louis had waited with bated breath, restless and on edge, as it awaited the judge\u2019s ruling, as CNN notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruling, handed down by St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson, ultimately read: \u201cThis court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, or that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.\u201d\n\nStockley, who was then on the police force, shot Smith, a 24-year-old father, after a police chase in December 2011.\n\nStockley, as to be expected, claimed that he had acted in self-defense, saying he believed that Smith was reaching for a weapon in the car. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and waived his right to a jury trial, instead preferring to stand before a judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors accused him of planting the gun in Smith\u2019s car in order to justify the shooting, pointing out that Stockley\u2019s DNA was found on the gun, but not Smith\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed with the court\u2019s finding,\u201d Circuit Judge Kim Gardner, whose office prosecuted the case, said in a release, according to Newsweek. \u201cI know there are better ways we can do this if we join together to make the system work for us all.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s family is expected to hold a press conference later Friday morning.\n\nAs Newsweek notes, protesters vowed that \u201cthere [would] be unrest\u201d in the city if the verdict ended up being not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Smith\u2019s fiancee, Christina Wilson, spoke at a press conference with the governor Thursday, urging protesters to remain peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe might not get what we want,\u201d Wilson said at the time. \u201cBut however it goes, I ask for peace on behalf of my daughter, on Anthony\u2019s loved ones, and if you feel like you want to speak out, speak how you feel. Just do it in a peaceful way.\u201d\n\nGov. Eric Greitens echoed Wilson\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI want every Missourian to listen to Christina\u2019s words,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that people will feel pain and hurt. But please, for Christina\u2019s sake, and for her daughter\u2019s sake, do not turn that pain into violence. One life has been lost in this case, and we don\u2019t need more bloodshed. We need peace, we need love, we need understanding and we need compassion for one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI ask every Missourian to please follow Christina\u2019s courageous and compassionate example,\u201d Greitens continued. \u201cWhatever the verdict is, we will protect every single person\u2019s right to peacefully protest. And whatever the verdict is, we\u2019ll also protect people\u2019s lives, their homes and our communities.\u201d\n\nPolice, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, have been preparing for the fallout, with barricades going up around the Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Thursday, and the St. Louis and St. Louis County police are preparing to have officers on 12-hour shifts Friday.\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2011, Stockley attempted to stop Smith after a suspected drug transaction. When Smith did not stop, a high-speed chase began. The then-officer shot at Smith\u2019s car during the chase, apparently screaming, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill this motherfucker, don\u2019t you know it!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, during the chase, the police vehicle crashed. Stockley got out armed with a service pistol and an AK-47, which he had against the Police Department\u2019s orders, and walked up to Smith\u2019s car firing five times at point-blank range with his pistol.\n\nNo witness could testify that they saw Smith with a weapon, and yet mysteriously, a .38 revolver that did not have Smith\u2019s DNA showed up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, yet, this is the justice that was served. And once again, St. Louis will be left confused, betrayed, shellshocked and more than likely enraged.

The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director. Rees gave an incredible speech that drove home the fact that, in her words, \u201cMudbound is cinema.\u201d\n\n\n\nFilm Independent via YouTube\n\nBut perhaps our favorite aspect of the Independent Spirit Awards is how fully it lives up to its name. In contrast to the formality of the Academy Awards, the independent spirit is alive and well at this awards ceremony, and the stars revel in it.

Upon arriving, police said they found Richards in the corner of his room. The lights were out and Richards was wearing sunglasses, holding a knife in one hand, with his right hand behind his back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his other hand was a toy gun, which Richards would later raise at the police, authorities say. One cop shot his stun gun at Richards; two others opened fire, killing him.\n\nThe NYPD released each of the videos captured from the four responding officers\u2019 body cameras. The department also shared a 17-minute compilation of all the footage compiled, which we\u2019ve included below. In total, seven videos were released.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Video contains graphic footage.\n\nThroughout the standoff, the footage shows, the 31-year-old Richards says nothing and appears expressionless, though the flashlights make it hard to see his features at several points in the video. He also doesn\u2019t appear to comply with officers, who repeatedly ask him to drop the knife. In total, BuzzFeed News counted 44 times the officers beseeched Richards to drop his weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point, an officer is heard saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to shoot you, but I will if you don\u2019t drop that knife.\u201d\n\nRichards\u2019 landlord and two friends, who were at the scene, also beg him to comply with the cops.\n\n\u201cDude, put your hands up!\u201d one of them yells. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d\n\nBut the standoff escalates once Richards raises the toy gun at the cops, who indicate that they aren\u2019t sure if the gun is real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne officer, whom DNAinfo identified as Mark Fleming, calls out to Richards: \u201cI don\u2019t want to shoot you if you\u2019ve got a fake gun in your hand, you hear me? But I will shoot you if that\u2019s a real gun.\u201d\n\nOfficers end up firing 16 shots at Richards.\n\nWith the footage made public, speculation will certainly fly over whether officers could have done more to de-escalate the situation, especially considering Richards\u2019 mental condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudies in recent years show that those with mental disabilities are 16 times more likely to be killed by police. A Washington Post report from 2015 found that a quarter of the people shot by officers that year were mentally ill.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, the NYPD starting equipping its officers with body cameras in April of this year as part of a pilot program to increase transparency.\n\nBy the end of the year, an expected 1,200 NYPD cops will be equipped with the technology, according to Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill.", "keywords": ["gun", "shoot", "bronx", "hand", "knife", "ill", "officers", "shooting", "mentally", "richards", "releases", "man", "nypd", "video", "footage", "drop", "showing"], "polarity": 0.013805465367965366, "subjectivity": 0.4573029401154401},

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance.

The Oscars are Sunday night, and just like Issa Rae, we\u2019re \u201crooting for everybody black.\u201d Here\u2019s a breakdown of the black contenders for the gold in this year\u2019s major categories.\n\nBest Actor\n\nDaniel Kaluuya: Get Out\n\nScreenshot: Universal Pictures\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news of Daniel Kaluuya\u2019s nomination for his portrayal of Chris Washington in Get Out came as very little surprise to anyone who watched the movie, helping it to reach its $255 million box-office figure. The satire/horror film was both a critical and financial success, leading to speculation that he could walk away with Oscar gold.\n\nCould he win? Nah, fam. Get Out gives white people the heebie-jeebies. His odds of winning are as bad as the odds of a black guy making it to the end of most horror movies. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut Get Out is not a horror movie. It\u2019s a documentary.\u201d\n\nDenzel Washington: Roman J. Israel, Esq.\n\nScreenshot: Columbia Pictures\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with Kaluuya, Denzel Washington, a perennial favorite, is helping to buoy the nominations for blacks this year in the Best Actor category. Washington portrays the titular legal persona, Roman J. Israel, with drama and humor.\n\nCould he win? Unfortunately, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn\u2019t appreciate black people doing comedy. Or drama. Or anything. Plus, the movie was neither a critical darling nor a financial success. He should be happy just to be nominated.\n\nAnalysis: Over the last decade, the award in this category has often gone to actors playing white dudes amid historical periods, like Daniel Day-Lewis (who is also nominated this year), for his roles in There Will Be Blood and Lincoln; Sean Penn in Milk; and Eddie Redmayne for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. The closest nonhistorical portrayals to Washington\u2019s role among recent winners are probably Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart. The precedent set by these two wins arguably gives Washington the better shot of the two black actors this year. But this means his performance will have to get more votes than two in movies that are both notably historical and dramatic: Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour and Daniel Day-Lewis in Phantom Thread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote: There are no black nominees for best actress or best supporting actor this year.\n\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\n\n\nOctavia Spencer: The Shape of Water\n\nScreenshot: Fox Searchlight\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctavia Spencer snagged a nomination for her role in The Shape of Water this year, making her the first black actress to be nominated two years in a row. She also now ties Viola Davis for Oscar nominations with three.\n\nCould she win? Spencer has a slight chance because of her pedigree and the fact that there is no clear-cut favorite in the category.\n\nMary J. Blige: Mudbound\n\nScreenshot: Armory Films\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J. Blige surprised everyone with her understated portrayal in Mudbound and could be the first actress to win an award for a movie released on a streaming service (Netflix), which might undercut the boycott of that service by a previous black Academy Award winner, Mo\u2019Nique.\n\nCould she win? Possibly. Academy voters love newcomers like Jennifer Hudson, who gave a star turn in Dreamgirls. Even though Spencer might split the small black vote with Blige, a lot of liberal Oscar voters like the song \u201cReal Love.\u201d\n\nAnalysis: Looking at history to predict the future in this category seems to give even odds to most of the actresses in the category this year. Some might consider Spencer\u2019s recent win for Hidden Figures to be a potential handicap, however, considering that the academy might not want to hand her the award after a previous win and back-to-back nominations. Also, Spencer gets her nomination from a science fiction movie, a genre mostly honored at the Oscars in more technical categories, like sound editing and visual effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest Director\n\nJordan Peele: Get Out\n\nScreenshot: NBC Universal\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan Peele, for Get Out, represents the only black entry among this year\u2019s Best Director nominees.\n\nCould he win? Looking at the past decade, Peele\u2019s best hope for a win lies in the winning precedent of drama and grit, set by films like Slumdog Millionaire, The Hurt Locker and Birdman, as opposed to the cinematic eye candy displayed by films like Gravity and The Revenant. But in the year of #MeToo, Peele\u2019s chances may also be undercut by Greta Gerwig, the only female nominee in the category, nominated for Lady Bird.\n\nBest Picture\n\nJordan Peele: Get Out\n\nGet Out, represented in five categories this year, has a tough run to complete in order to pick up the win for Best Picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould he win? First off, it\u2019s an off year for #OscarsSoWhite guilt. That is to say, last year\u2019s win by Moonlight in the category might offer the academy slight relief from the social pressure to take Get Out so seriously. Also, Get Out is fighting an uphill battle against a grouping of four historical films out of the nine Best Picture nominees this year: Darkest Hour, Dunkirk (both World War II films), Phantom Thread and The Post. Historical films account for about half the winners over the last decade in this category.\n\n\n\nOne factor that gives some hope is that many times, the Best Director and Best Picture categories are closely related; about half the time, the film that wins one award wins both.\n\nWith an academy that\u2019s over 90 percent white and over 70 percent male, winning it over seems to be a daunting task for our nominees in a lot of these categories. It\u2019s not surprising to see wins that heavily favor white, male-centric nominees even in categories that aren\u2019t gender-specific\u2014thus #OscarsSoWhite.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oscars air on March 4, should you choose to watch, with black fist held high, rooting for black excellence to shine.\n\n", "keywords": ["movie", "win", "categories", "films", "academy", "handicapping", "black", "washington", "best", "rooting", "nominees", "everybody", "category", "oscar", "spencer"], "polarity": 0.2255360422405878, "subjectivity": 0.3797382920110191},

A response I made to comments on an Instagram post became fodder for a piece that I believe was designed to create conflict where there isn\u2019t any. It\u2019s perhaps more complex than that,\u201d Thompson wrote.\n\nThe actress was referring to a comment she made on a now deleted Instagram post that featured celebrities and activists celebrating the Time\u2019s Up initiative. Included in the photo was Dunham, whose presence angered and confused some commenters, who wanted to know why a woman who recently defended an accused rapist would be featured in a photo commemorating an anti-sexual-harassment initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI support this initiative and the fight for gender justice and am really glad that the movement is growing,\u201d one user commented. \u201cI however am perplexed by the inclusion of Lena Dunham, a woman who publicly accused a young sexual assault survivor of color, Aurora Perrineau, of lying about her assault.\u201d As Nylon notes, the user then went on to note that Dunham still hasn\u2019t apologized directly to Perrineau, despite the fact that the man Dunham had defended, longtime friend Murray Miller, lied.\n\n\u201cWould greatly appreciate your thoughts on this as it gravely discredits your efforts to include Lena without holding her accountable,\u201d the user wrote to Thompson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson offered this response:\n\nLena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for the actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It\u2019s been discussed.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAccording to Thompson\u2019s own account, the Girls creator was more like the chick who doesn\u2019t do a lick of work for the group project, but shows up on the day of the presentation with her hair pressed, asking if there\u2019s anything she can do to help.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would be trash enough, but remember, this \u201cgroup project\u201d\u2014in this case, demonstrative and impactful feminism\u2014is a big part of Dunham\u2019s brand.\n\nThompson\u2019s comments supported what many have suspected about Dunham\u2019s public persona versus her private work. Still, the Creed actress seemed to have a change of heart after multiple outlets covered her remarks.\n\n\u201cI, in no way, want to diminish Lena Dunham and her work, her voice, and her importance. We have spoken and she knows my heart,\u201d Thompson wrote in her Tuesday-morning statement. \u201cI feel a responsibility to women that have sometimes felt ignored, dismissed, and underrepresented. They are my beacons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson added that she regretted that her words \u201cwere misinterpreted\u201d and distracted from the size and inclusivity of the Time\u2019s Up campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Thompson would feel torn up about distracting from the Time\u2019s Up initiative, which provides a legal defense fund for women across industries who have been the victims of sexual harassment and which she has been at the forefront of promoting. To borrow overused but accurate parlance, Thompson has been \u201cdoing the work,\u201d and burying that work under comments she made about Dunham surely isn\u2019t what she intended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Dunham\u2019s feminism has been toxic for people of color, and particularly women of color, and it\u2019s fair and worthwhile to point that out. Following her support of Miller and her nonapology to Perrineau, writer Zinzi Clemmons, who has worked with Dunham and known her for years, minced no words when she said that it was time for women of color to \u201cdivest\u201d from the faux feminist.\n\n\u201cShe cannot have our words if she cannot respect us,\u201d Clemmons wrote.\n\nThe grace and work Thompson has shown are commendable.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["awards", "great", "eye", "looks", "love", "mary", "price", "black", "color", "js", "opal", "sag", "limit", "look", "michael", "bliges"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

If not for the relentless efforts of such organizations as the African American Policy Forum, the Black Women\u2019s Blueprint and OKC Artists for Justice, Holtzclaw\u2019s crimes may have flown under the radar, which is too often the case when black women are victims of heinous crimes.\n\nThough I was thrilled to see Holtzclaw shaking and crying in court like the cowardly predator that he is, and happy for the women who did receive some validation in a court of law that their lives mattered, he should have never felt comfortable enough to prey on them in the first place. But this country teaches men\u2014with power and without\u2014that black women are disposable.\n\nEven with the unexpected verdict, though, I could not stop thinking about the five women who were told that their pain, their suffering, their trauma, meant nothing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could not stop thinking about Recy Taylor and Gertrude Perkins.\n\nRecy Taylor was 24 years old on Sept. 3, 1944, when she was abducted, blindfolded and gang-raped by six white supremacists in Abbeville, Ala. She was walking home from church with her friend Fannie Daniel and Daniel\u2019s son, West, when a green Chevrolet that had circled the street several times finally pulled alongside them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven white men forced Taylor into the vehicle at gunpoint; one of them, Billy Howerton, would later say that he didn\u2019t participate in the rape because he knew Taylor, the New York Times reports.\n\nTaylor, who died Dec. 27 at 97 years old, told her story to NPR\u2019s Michel Martin in 2011:\n\n\n\nWe went on to church and came back. A car running around outside of us, six young men jumped out with a gun and said that\u2014you\u2019re the one that cut a white boy in Clarkton. And the police got us out looking for you. You get in the car and we will take you uptown to the police station. And they got me in the car and carried me straight through the woods, but before they go where they was going, they blindfolded me. After they messed over and did what they were going to do me, say, we\u2019re going to take you back. We\u2019re going to put you out. But if you tell it, we\u2019re going to kill you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 2011 interview with The Root, Taylor talked about the loud silence smothering her pain.\n\n\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t nothing done about it,\u201d Taylor, then 91, said. \u201cThe sheriff never even said he was sorry it happened. I think more people should know about it \u2026 but ain\u2019t nobody [in Abbeville] saying nothing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sheriff, George H. Gamble, didn\u2019t say he was sorry because he wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nThere was only one vehicle in Abbeville that matched the description of Taylor\u2019s assailants, one belonging to Hugo Wilson. Upon being \u201cquestioned\u201d by Gamble, Wilson said that he, Herbert Lovett, Dillard York, Luther Lee, Willie Joe Culpepper and Robert Gamble (relation to Sheriff Gamble unknown) all \u201chad intercourse with her,\u201d but he insisted that she was a prostitute\u2014and Gamble sent him home, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe night after she was raped, the home that Taylor shared with her husband and 3-year-old daughter was firebombed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter that, they moved in with us,\u201d Benny Corbitt, Taylor\u2019s brother, told The Root. \u201cAt night, my father would sit in a tree and guard the house with a shotgun.\u201d\n\n\n\nEnter: Rosa Parks.\n\n\n\nDespite what whitewashed history books would have us believe, Rosa Parks\u2019 radical action on Dec. 1, 1955, was neither random nor spontaneous. She was not simply a tired seamstress too exhausted to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus to a white man; she was a veteran organizer and activist on a mission.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaudette Colvin, then 15, had refused to give up her seat on the bus to a white woman nine months prior to Parks. For daring to be free, Colvin was thrown off the bus and arrested, but she didn\u2019t become the face of the movement. Instead, she found herself shunned by her community, alone and pregnant.\n\n\u201c[Rosa Parks\u2019] skin texture was the kind that people associate with the middle class,\u201d Colvin said in a 2009 NPR interview. \u201cShe fit that profile.\u201d\n\nIn addition, as the secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, Parks was well-known, well-respected and an \u201cinherently impressive person,\u201d historian David Garrow, the author of Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, told NPR.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruthless disregard with which movement leaders treated Colvin should not be erased, as it mirrors how those deemed \u201cimperfect victims\u201d are often sidelined today; neither should the fact that Parks used every ounce of her class and color privilege for her people\u2014and, perhaps, to free a younger version of herself.\n\nIn 1931, when she was 18 years old, Parks was the victim of an attempted rape. \u201cMr. Charlie,\u201d as she referred to him, was a white neighbor who employed young Rosa in his home snd tried to force himself on her, and she described her feelings in detail in a letter that was discovered in 2011.\n\n\u201cI was trapped and helpless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was hurt and sickened through with anger and disgust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps Parks\u2019 personal experience led her down the path to becoming the fierce advocate for justice that she would become. Long before she set foot on that Montgomery bus, she had been fighting for black women who were raped, sexually assaulted and harassed by white supremacists in the Deep South and documenting their stories. The Montgomery busing system was the site not just of racial terror but for racialized sexual abuse as well.\n\n\n\nParks knew that.\n\nAs Danielle McGuire, historian and author of Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance\u2014A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power, notes:\n\n\n\nOther than police officers, few were as guilty of committing acts of racist violence and sexual harassment of black women as Montgomery\u2019s bus operators, who bullied and brutalized black passengers daily. Worse, bus drivers had police power. They carried blackjacks and guns, and they assaulted and sometimes even killed African Americans who refused to abide by the racial order of Jim Crow. In 1953 alone, African Americans filed over thirty formal complaints of abuse and mistreatment on the buses. Most came from working-class black women, mainly domestics, who made up nearly 70% of the bus ridership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParks knew exactly what she doing in 1955, just as she did in 1944, when, at 31 years old, she went to Abbeville to investigate the brutal rape of Recy Taylor.\n\n\n\nIn 1944, after meeting with Taylor and hearing her story firsthand, Parks formed the Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor, a campaign that soon garnered support from activists, organizers and writers such as Mary Church Terrell, Langston Hughes and W.E.B. Du Bois. Before it was all said and done, there were Recy Taylor groups all across the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chicago Defender called it \u201cthe strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade,\u201d yet it is barely spoken about today. Taylor died never receiving justice because two all-white, all-male juries refused to indict her rapists.\n\nIn 1949, five years after Taylor was abducted and raped, Gertrude Perkins was walking home from a party in Montgomery, Ala., when she was abducted and raped by two white police officers.\n\n\n\nThe officers accused her of \u201cpublic drunkenness,\u201d pushed her into the back of their squad car and drove her to a railroad embankment, where they raped her behind a building. Perkins was then dumped at a bus stop and warned to keep her mouth shut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosa Parks also fought for justice for Perkins, forming the Citizens Committee for Gertrude Perkins, patterned after the campaign she spearheaded for Recy Taylor.\n\nPerkins, like Taylor, never received justice.\n\n\n\nMcGuire, who details both Perkins\u2019 and Taylor\u2019s stories in Dark End of the Street, reported that authorities \u201crefused to hold a line-up or issue any warrants since, according to the mayor, it would \u2018violate the Constitutional rights\u2019 of the police. Besides, he said, \u2018my policemen would not do a thing like that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Taylor, Perkins\u2019 reputation was maligned, her life was threatened, and her attackers\u2014standing boldly in plain sight, shielded by their whiteness and badges, never suffered any consequences.\n\nJust as whitewashed school books didn\u2019t teach us that the 1965 state-sanctioned police murder of 26-year-old Jimmy Lee Jackson in Selma, Ala., was the impetus for the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, \u201cGertrude Perkins\u201d is a name that not many people know.\n\n\u201cGertrude Perkins is not even mentioned in the history books, but she had as much to do with the bus boycott as anyone on earth,\u201d Joe Azbell, former city editor of the Montgomery Advertiser, said during a 1997 NPR interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are just two of the names we know and here we are today\u2014still.\n\nSexual misconduct is the second-highest form of police misconduct in the nation after excessive force. \ufeffAccording to a 2007 report prepared for the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, The Nation reports, \u201cRape and sexual abuse by police [in the United States] are primarily reported by women of color.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[B]lack women are routinely killed, raped and beaten by the police,\u201d wrote Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies and co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, in the 2015 report \u201c#SayHerName: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the 2018 Golden Globes Awards on Sunday night, Oprah Winfrey brought these women into the room. She stood before Hollywood\u2019s elite crowd and told Recy Taylor\u2019s story. She didn\u2019t just talk about the women who are assaulted on casting couches, but the women who work on farms and in diners and in academia who have all been silenced by too-powerful men.\n\n\n\nAnd while she didn\u2019t mention her own story of being repeatedly molested and of being raped at 9 years old by a family friend, you could see it in her eyes and hear it in her voice as she said, \u201cMe, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the intersection of state and sexual violence, you will find black women who are silenced, ignored and erased. That has been the reality for too long because we live in a country where our blackness and our gender have made assaults against our bodies permissible. As I\u2019ve written previously, systemic oppression has always been mapped on the bodies of black women\u2014whether that oppression manifests through state violence or in our own communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement, was in tears Sunday night because this moment is not just shining a much deserved spotlight on her tireless work; it is not just a moment for white women to confront their complicity in violence against women of color; it is not just a moment to disrupt the dominant narrative that rape and sexual assault matter only when the victims are young, rich, able-bodied, straight and white.\n\n\n\nBurke, who began her organizing career in Alabama and has played a key role in organizing events in Selma, has made it clear that this movement is built on the shoulders of our elders.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do this work without continuously referencing the work of Rosa Parks fighting against the sexual and racial violence that black women were subjected to,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that it is our duty to tell these stories. It is our duty to lift up our elders and ancestors so that no one forgets their names or dilutes their legacies. We are standing in a tradition of black women who fought back against white supremacy and sexual violence over 70 years ago and made it plain that there can be no black liberation if black women are not free.\n\nThis movement is for Recy Taylor.\n\n\n\nThis movement is for Gertrude Perkins.\n\nThis movement is for Claudette Colvin, and for all of the black girls who are shamed into silence because they have been told they aren\u2019t good enough, pretty enough or smart enough for anyone to pay attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movement continues the work of Rosa Parks, who risked her life chasing justice for black women in the Jim Crow South, only to have her legacy be distilled down to not giving up her seat on a bus.\n\nThis movement is for the five women who did not get justice even though, they, too, were raped by Daniel Holtzclaw.\n\nThis movement is for the young Oprah Winfreys\u2014born into poverty in the Deep South, molested, neglected and not expected to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movement is for the black girls who, right now, are being raped and abused in their homes and in their churches and in their schools by people who claim to love them in a nation that claims to care.\n\n\n\nThis movement is ours.\n\nThere is no slowing down. There is no giving up.\n\n\n\nThere is no turning back.", "keywords": ["white", "taylor", "mothers", "metoo", "women", "gertrude", "parks", "black", "raped", "rosa", "perkins", "bus", "rape", "sexual", "movement", "recy"], "polarity": 0.04695361781076063, "subjectivity": 0.42208472479901055},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["know", "hannah", "beachler", "wakanda", "marvel", "different", "walks", "black", "production", "important", "panther", "world", "africa", "told", "designer", "studiosdisney"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for.

But as it\u2019s gained steam in the collective consciousness, we genuinely hope the red-carpet blackout is a significant show of strength for the over-300-strong all-female coalition seemingly ready to put their money and power where their mouths are, in part by creating legal defense funds and lobbying for stronger protections and parity for women far less privileged than they are.\n\nWhile wearing black may seem like a small gesture in addressing the systemic sexual abuse and inequality that continue to plague women outside of Hollywood, supporting the gesture seems like the least we can do to support a movement that appears to have all of our best interests at heart.

Some butches may look forward to the Super Bowl (I\u2019m personally planning to hate-watch Justin Timberlake\u2019s halftime show), but I look forward to awards season because: red carpets!\n\nListen, I\u2019ve spent most of my life watching hundreds of hours of Project Runway and awards shows, so I consider myself an armchair stylist/designer (that\u2019s a thing, right?). Besides, who can say no to spending hours discussing past Golden Globes dresses, trends and red-carpet-winning looks? Not this stud!\n\n\n\nSince they clearly forgot my ticket to the actual show, tonight I plan to attend The Glow Up\u2019s Facebook party while also hanging out with Black Twitter\u2014 because you can\u2019t outdo black people. So while I wash my \u201cI\u2019m Rooting For Everybody Black\u201d T-shirt and plan my snacks, let\u2019s get into my top five expectations for the Golden Globes red carpet and telecast!\n\n1. Serving Face\n\nThe red carpet is about an all-around look, but the face is just as important as the dress. As the kids say, a beat face does wonders. Plus, part of the face is the look that ladies on the carpet can give reporters who don\u2019t ask actual questions. Yes, I want to know who she\u2019s wearing, but she\u2019s also there for an accomplishment\u2014not who she\u2019s dating. Ask better questions. In any case, a good contour matched with a shady smile will make all the difference in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Raise Your Hands for Natural Hair\n\nListen ... I used to live in the house of creamy crack (relaxers, for those who don\u2019t know), but there\u2019s nothing like a good natural braided style or mini \u2019fro or even a blowout that can take my breath away. Remember Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s hair at last year\u2019s Screen Actor Guild Awards? Or Taraji P. Henson\u2019s do on the Black Girls Rock! red carpet? Or my queer sister Lena Waithe\u2019s intricate braided style at the Primetime Emmys? Natural hair on the red carpet reminds young black women that the hair that grows out of our heads is one of the most beautiful and desirable accessories we have in our arsenal of #BlackGirlMagic tricks.\n\n3. Staying on Message\n\nThis Globes is political. Since the public explosion of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and countless others, this will be the first time Hollywood is getting together en masse to celebrate itself. No doubt the mood in the Beverly Hilton might shift from the normal party atmosphere to a more somber evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of course, many are writing about what wearing black on the red carpet will do for the the #TimesUp movement that initiated it and the #MeToo movement founded by Tarana Burke. Will Hollywood stars wearing black really mean something to survivors, or will it come across as self-serving (side-eying you, Rose McGowan)? We also know sexual assault and harassment is not a single-gender issue, so, for folks who do decide to wear black in protest on the red carpet, I hope they\u2019ll be mindful of gendered language when discussing the impact of sexual assault, harassment and violence.\n\n4. More Amy Poehler and Tina Fey\u2014Sorry, Seth Meyers\n\nI\u2019ll be highly surprised if I actually like the monologue. I mean, who can top Amy Poehler and Tina Fey? Probably somebody like Tiffany Haddish. But this year, we\u2019ve got Seth Meyers, which in some ways feels a little off for me. Considering that Hollywood is having its \u201cCome to Jesus\u201d moment, I wonder if maybe this is a bit tone-deaf for the current moment that we\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019m going to miss the \u201cgirl power\u201d of Poehler and Fey, and hope the handling of Hollywood\u2019s emerging scandals will be done with unbridled realness, because that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to break the ice in the room. Let\u2019s get real about what is happening\u2014not just in Hollywood, but in our culture as a whole. Honesty on Meyers\u2019 part might help his fellow dude-bros hear what women, in particular, have been saying for years about the ways in which we are silenced. I\u2019d also really love to see him tell people to straight up stop working with Woody Allen. But I\u2019m pretty sure that won\u2019t happen.\n\n5. Black Excellence\n\nWith this year\u2019s sparse nominations of black actors, I\u2019m hoping to see wins in every category in which a black person is nominated. Yep, I\u2019m rooting for everybody black. The Glow Up\u2019s #ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition got me hyped for all of that beautiful black excellence that will grace the red carpet! And if you\u2019re a black woman who wins an award, it\u2019s at least guaranteed that Taraji P. Henson will celebrate you, because that\u2019s #Sisterhood (crossing my fingers, because I\u2019d love to see that Issa Rae/Taraji P. Henson moment).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition No shade to Christmas, but here at The Glow Up, it\u2019s the most wonderful time of year\u2014except Fashion \u2026 Read more Read\n\nAre you ready?

A young black woman narrating. References to Fannie Lou Hamer and Harriet Tubman. Mentions of SZA and Solange. Testosterone might power Black Lightning, the superhero, but a healthy dose of estrogen helps drive Black Lightning, the series.\n\nIn the series, based on the DC Comic launched in 1977, actor Cress Williams (who\u2019s been paying dues as far back as Scooter on Living Single and Lavon Hayes on Hart of Dixie) plays Jefferson Pierce, a hometown Olympic-gold-medal hero-turned-do-gooder principal at Garfield High and community leader, forced to secretly crusade as Black Lightning. Forced because the father of two daughters\u2014high schooler Jennifer (China Anne McClain) and medical student Anissa (Nafessa Williams)\u2014still pines for their mother, Lynn (Christine Adams, Agent Weaver from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.).\n\nUnable to handle the painful physical demands and the emotional toll on Jeff (broken bones, bloody wounds), Lynn made it painfully clear that there would be no \u201cwe\u201d with Black Lightning around, eventually divorcing Jeff. And though he suppressed his superhero alter ego, opting to \u201csave more lives as a principal,\u201d she has yet to relent.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t stop Jeff\u2019s eyes from burning with desire for only her (even though there is at least one woman waiting in the wings to happily scoop him up). Because, ultimately, he\u2019s \u201cjust a man who wants his woman back,\u201d he desperately wants to let go of Black Lightning, especially since there is clearly still love on Lynn\u2019s part, too\u2014if only she would allow herself to go there. But despite Jeff\u2019s best intentions, the streets keep calling and derailing their reunion. Since his heart also bleeds for his girls, he will do whatever it takes to keep them safe, even if it means resurrecting Black Lightning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Jeff\u2019s daughters are no damsels in distress. Instead, they are formidable forces in their own right: Jennifer is \u201ca standout scholar-athlete, just like her father,\u201d while Anissa chips in as a health educator. Both are intelligent and strong-willed free thinkers steeped in black history\u2014and \u201cherstory.\u201d While Jennifer is in the throes of teenage rebellion, Anissa goes #BlackLivesMatter hard for social justice. And though their father doesn\u2019t hesitate to protect them, Black Lightning shows that these young women are more than capable of handling themselves. In fact, their strength foreshadows the superhero gifts that surely await them.\n\nStill, some challenges are too big to fight alone. When the rebellious Jennifer entangles herself with local gang the 100, putting both herself and her sister in danger, their father is left with few options to save them. But Black Lightning soon discovers that he can\u2019t just use his gift to save his own and walk away; his entire community is in danger, and just putting in work at Garfield High isn\u2019t going to change that. However, his necessary heroics don\u2019t dim the community\u2019s female voices and concerns.\n\nOne of the more interesting developments in Black Lightning is that the 100\u2019s reign of terror very much includes the sexual violation and exploitation of young black women. Sex trafficking is actually tagged as one of their most egregious crimes here, while most crime stories in urban communities\u2014fictional as well as real-life depictions\u2014overlook the high price that black girls and women pay with their bodies and lives. It\u2019s a grim reality to address in a world that often acts as if black womanhood is expendable and black girlhood is nonexistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually refreshing, black female sexuality isn\u2019t just a straight affair. Through elder daughter Anissa, queer black women are represented and acknowledged. Though this is also true of the comic book series, television is notorious for not following the rules.\n\nBut Anissa\u2019s sexuality is not just significant to the superhero genre; queer black women are typically ignored in all stories, even in LGBTQ-focused ones\u2014and especially in black ones. If they are depicted at all, as in the recent She\u2019s Gotta Have It, it\u2019s more fetishistic than real. Even as black gay men become more regular fixtures in television, demanding at least obligatory representation in contemporary black stories like Insecure, black gay women remain invisible\u2014or seemingly unicorns, like in Survivor\u2019s Remorse. So Black Lightning\u2019s inclusion is a key departure.\n\nBlack Lightning seizes every opportunity to show that black women are very much an organic part of the black community, far beyond the classroom and the church. From the TV news anchor to the cop at the police station to the senator speaking at the school fundraiser, black women are well-represented here. And they aren\u2019t cookie-cutter in appearance, either\u2014not even in hairstyles. Jennifer wears her hair straight and long and Anissa is loose and curly, while their mother, Lynn, is close-cropped. And as a bonus, the women featured are overwhelming chocolate sisters. So clearly the Kerry Washingtons, Issa Raes and Rutina Wesleys are making strong impressions on showrunners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to how we are represented on the small screen, screenwriter and producer Mara Brock Akil just keeps raising the bar. From Girlfriends to Being Mary Jane\u2014with a little of The Game in between\u2014she has been a key catalyst for projecting images of the contemporary black woman on TV. That she\u2019s been able to accomplish this largely by creating and collaborating with her husband, Salim Akil, is even more impressive. Salim Akil might well be the driving force behind bringing Black Lightning to TV, but the execution clearly demonstrates that he and his wife balance each other out.\n\nEven in the male-dominated superhero genre, the Akils have managed to adapt 1970s idealism to the harsh realities of now, without forcing black women to the background, while staying true to the comics\u2019 black-family spirit. With Black Lightning, they\u2019ve created a TV series for the present that finally includes us all.", "keywords": ["strike", "women", "lightning", "woman", "doesnt", "ladies", "black", "young", "anissa", "father", "superhero", "tv", "jennifer"], "polarity": 0.052559820275647574, "subjectivity": 0.4887036305021914},

The 14-episode first season was an exploration of what Blay calls \u201cblack-girl culture\u201d\u2014in all its regular, degular, schmegular everyday magic. As she stated in her launch video, \u201cWhatever it means to be a black girl, I\u2019m that.\u201d\n\nHere at The Glow Up, we couldn\u2019t agree more, which is why we were excited to speak with Blay about the next phase of Professional Black Girl. It\u2019s been a profound and joyful labor of love for the professor and now producer\u2014with an endowed chair in political science at North Carolina Central University\u2014whose academic work has focused specifically on black body politics and black racial identity:\n\nMost of my work is about trying to teach through images. I use images\u2014and now, moving images\u2014to spark conversations ... [but] the fulfillment for me now is coming from recognizing that the internet and these platforms are my classroom. The joy that I get when the light bulbs go off for my students, I also get that when just being able to have regular conversations with folks and throwing some information, or pushing folks to think a little differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversations sparked by the first season of Professional Black Girl resonated deeply with all types of black women. This, despite the show\u2019s concept being a happy accident that occurred while Blay was developing another series, centered on black hair:\n\nAnd then, once I launched it, it just became a thing. I mean, I wasn\u2019t ready for it, but it brings me so much joy. I\u2019ve gotten so many messages from women\u2014I mean, women have stopped me on the street just to say \u201cThank you.\u201d And it\u2019s, like, amazing to me to hear women who are, like, literally rocket scientists, and medical doctors, and CEOs who are saying, \u201cGirl, thank you.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s ready to take her show on the road, hoping to film her second season in New Orleans\u2014hopefully, with a little help from her Professional Black Girl friends:\n\nNew Orleans is and has long been considered probably the most\u2014not just black\u2014but the most African city in America ... I\u2019m used to being in black spaces, but, like, there\u2019s something different about New Orleans and it\u2019s really\u2014for me\u2014it\u2019s culture, you know? And so, when I think of how I came to be a professional black girl, of course it\u2019s based upon my memories and my experiences growing up in New Orleans. There\u2019s just nowhere like New Orleans, you know? I just feel like we deserve so much better than the memory of Katrina. Like, we still there, so wanting the joy that Professional Black Girl has brought to us up to this point, [I\u2019m] wanting to bring some of that to New Orleans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a brief 48 hours, Blay\u2019s season 2 Kickstarter campaign has gained significant steam.

And this is regular, everyday kind of joy.

But more than anything, whatever kind of Professional Black Girl you might be, be that\u2014in all of your regular-black-girl glory. Because all other credentials aside, trust us, it\u2019s enough.

But much more important and inspiring is to see women use the power they have to empower other women.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re giving a #WomanCrushWednesday hat tip to the 300-strong all-female alliance behind the #TimesUp movement. The powerhouse group of women, which includes Shonda Rhimes, Kerry Washington, Rashida Jones and entertainment attorney Nina L. Shaw, are doing the work of dismantling inequity and abuse\u2014not only for themselves but also for the least privileged among us, as stated by their call to action:\n\nTIME\u2019S UP is a unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere. From movie sets to farm fields to boardrooms alike, we envision nationwide leadership that reflects the world in which we live.\n\nWord. And while we deeply appreciate the fact that these women are joining, lobbying and fundraising for women much less privileged than they are, we also appreciate that instead of appropriating and piggybacking off of Tarana Burke\u2019s #MeToo hashtag and movement\u2014which was initially created for black and brown girls\u2014these women are adding to the rallying cry by initiating a complementary coalition that specifically leverages their public presence when it comes to calling out sexual abuse for all women, as they have with Alianza Nacional de Campesinas (the National Farmworker Women\u2019s Alliance):\n\n[W]e see you, we thank you, and we acknowledge the heavy weight of the common experience of being preyed upon, harassed and exploited by those who abuse their power and threaten our physical and economic security. We have similarly suppressed the violence and demeaning harassment for fear that we will be attacked and ruined in the process of speaking out. We share your feelings of anger and shame. We harbor fear that no one will believe us, that we will look weak, or that we will be dismissed; and we are terrified that we will be fired or never hired again in retaliation. We also recognize our privilege and the fact that we have access to enormous platforms to amplify our voices. Both of which have drawn and driven widespread attention to the existence of this problem in our industry that farmworker women and countless individuals employed in other industries have not been afforded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the Golden Globes approaching this weekend, we are gratified to see that the black dresses on the red carpet this year will be more than simply a symbol of solidarity, and that action is not far behind.", "keywords": ["women", "field", "crush", "abuse", "appreciate", "playing", "hollywood", "power", "black", "womancrushwednesday", "privileged", "timesup", "working", "fear", "entertainment", "fact", "sexual", "level", "farmworker"], "polarity": 0.007467532467532464, "subjectivity": 0.4545238095238095},

This preschool teacher-turned-women\u2019s financial educator knows that everything you need to know about how to manage your money, you did not learn in kindergarten. She is the author of the Amazon No. 1 best-selling book The One Week Budget: Learn to Create Your Money Management System in 7 Days or Less! and creator of the Live Richer Challenge, a series of 22-day courses, which to date have helped revolutionize the financial habits of more than 500,00 women from all 50 states and 100 countries.\n\n\n\nEver the teacher, Aliche tells The Glow Up she created the challenge to give women access to \u201cknowledge and community ... because that\u2019s where we came from as Africans.\u201d\n\nAnd if it takes a village, you can count on Aliche to build one; the Live Richer Challenge comes with a 270,000-strong 24-7 Facebook support group called the Dream Catchers.\n\nThe Live Richer Challenge starts with creating the \u201cWealthy Mindset.\u201d Step 1 is calculating the worth of your home\u2014which goes far beyond just the property you own. Aliche asks me, if I were to cash them in today, do I know the value of my jewelry or individual retirement account and insurance policies? Admittedly, I don\u2019t. But insurance and IRAs figure largely in individual net worth. According to the Budgetnista, most policies are worth 50 percent or less if cashed in before term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy day 2, you\u2019ll know your net worth and the difference between being able to pay for something versus truly being able to afford something. Aliche says, \u201cYeah, you might be able to buy that BMW, but if it breaks down, do you have the money to fix it?\u201d By day 3, you might be ready to snap your wallet shut.\n\nEveryone wants to know: How do I get to have more and owe less? Week 2 challenges focus on increasing your net worth by first identifying your skill set to create a side hustle.\n\nAliche says that sadly, only 1 in 5 women negotiates her salary. As a first-generation Nigerian immigrant, Aliche is no stranger to negotiating\u2014her parents insisted that their five daughters bargain for every purchase, from apples to appliances. She shows women how to negotiate their salaries and stop leaving that money on the table. She says, \u201cOnce you get that money; then there\u2019s the other side of the net-worth equation: Saving, investing and paying down debt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAliche cites a Prudential Bond (pdf) biannual survey that reports that African Americans\u2019 No. 1 financial goal is to be debt-free.\n\n\u201cIt sounds noble, but it\u2019s wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be\u2014debt-free\u2014and it doesn\u2019t mean anything. There are people who have a million dollars in debt but are billionaires. I want to shift that thinking that we\u2019re not just here to be debt-free.\u201d\n\nAliche is just paying off a $50,000 student loan after consulting with a debt-forgiveness specialist, successfully wiping $20,000 of the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, imagine if all of these years, instead of building a business, I focused on paying off the loan?\u201d she says. Instead, Aliche\u2019s introducing new #Squad Goals: \u201cFocus all of your energy on creating wealth.\u201d\n\nThe final phase of the Live Richer Challenge is maintenance. Get rid of liabilities and maintain your net worth. What can you do to make sure you don\u2019t get back into debt? Thrift first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBuying a new car is the biggest waste of money,\u201d says Aliche, who just treated herself to a 2-year-old used car.\n\nShe\u2019s also challenging us to \u201cnot be afraid to make more.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman gave me permission to soar\u2014to move beyond a six-figure business into an eight-figure business,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat convinced Aliche, who religiously gives 10 percent of her income to charity, was that while she was doing great for herself, there was so much more good she could accomplish. \u201cIf I make a million, that\u2019s 100K for my nonprofits,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat\u2019s the endgame? A billion-dollar venture capital business is the next big score for the coach of the Dream Catcher team.\n\nLess than 1 percent of minority businesses pass the $1 million mark in funding; a figure Aliche repeats several times, in defiance and disbelief. But one thing she does believe is that she could do an enormous amount of good being the final decision-maker in boardrooms from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, fielding pitches that would revolutionize the African-American marketplace. For instance: What about funding a perm that won\u2019t damage your hair?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the power of a seat at the table: If the money people in the room don\u2019t know your life, they don\u2019t know the potential of your product pitch. Aliche sees the dream: \u201cI want to be on the cover of Forbes: Brown girl. \u2018Billion Dollar Business\u2019\u2014with my locs and dark skin.\u201d Now, that\u2019s rich.", "keywords": ["know", "challenge", "richer", "women", "live", "money", "right", "worth", "thats", "cure", "antibroke", "till", "net", "2018", "aliche", "wait", "budgetnistas"], "polarity": 0.16024234886175184, "subjectivity": 0.4290535956580733},

For me, that word defines Serena Williams. I love her body\u2014it\u2019s invincible. I also love that none of her seemingly superhuman attributes were given to her or easily attained. Everything she has, she earned, one drop of sweat at a time. She and big sister Venus were their own mini-civil-rights movement as they fought to establish their place on the predominantly white tennis circuit, and they have dominated for nearly two decades.\n\nBecoming the mother to gorgeous baby girl Alexis Olympia\u2014who shares her February cover of Vogue magazine\u2014was no less a struggle than any of Williams\u2019 other feats; she came straight out of Compton, Calif., to be crowned the Best Athlete of All Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs told to Vogue, Williams\u2014newly married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2014was blessed with an easy pregnancy (as expected, given her supreme physical condition). But delivering the other cover girl on this month\u2019s Vogue was ultimately a \u201charrowing experience.\u201d Call it bad luck, but as her baby\u2019s heart rate plummeted dangerously low during birth, Williams required an emergency cesarean section.\n\nTo make matters worse, the new mother suffered a recurrence of blood clots\u2014a condition that flared up hours after the C-section that left Williams gasping for air and fearing that she was having another pulmonary embolism. After she advocated for herself and insisted on a CT scan and a blood thinner, another emergency surgery was performed to insert a filter into a major vein to clear up abdominal bleeding (a side effect of blood-thinning medication). To add to the drama, her C-section incision then ruptured because of the intense coughing caused by the blood clot. Our mighty Serena was left flat on her back for a full six weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, mother and daughter are now more than fine. Serena is up and naturally winning again, with a new clothing line launching on her website in March, serial investments in tech companies owned or led by black women, and a new home in Silicon Valley.\n\nIs she done with tennis? Not by a long shot. Twenty-three grand slams already have her name on them, and she\u2019s looking to own 25 in total, making her the greatest tennis player of all time (24 is the current record held by Australian Margaret Court).\n\nAs for motherhood, Williams only believes it ups her game, telling Vogue:\n\nKnowing I\u2019ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to play another match. I don\u2019t need the money or the titles or the prestige. I want them, but I don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s a different feeling for me ... It\u2019s interesting. ... There hasn\u2019t been a clear number one since I was there. It will be cool to see if I get there again, to what I call my spot\u2014where I feel I belong. I don\u2019t play to be the second best or the third best. If there\u2019s no clear number one, it\u2019s like, yeah, I can get my spot back. But if there is a clear number one, that\u2019s cool, too, because it\u2019s like, yeah, I\u2019m gonna come for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for introducing her daughter to Mom\u2019s stratospheric fame, Williams told Vogue that she wants baby Alexis to know that her own potential is absolutely limitless:", "keywords": ["number", "vogue", "love", "baby", "alexis", "slamming", "blood", "cover", "olympia", "dont", "best", "clear", "mother", "beautiful", "tennis", "williams", "serena"], "polarity": 0.2093217329545454, "subjectivity": 0.5015337527056276},

Everything felt urgent in a way\u2014I hadn\u2019t felt that sense of urgency before. For the creators, for the people behind the scenes, for the people who are doing this work\u2014I\u2019m going to speak for myself\u2014there\u2019s part of me that says, \u201cOh my God,\u201d I have to get this out now. I have to get all my dreams out today, because Lord, tomorrow is looking really dismal. That\u2019s what it felt for 2017. Like, let\u2019s do all of the plans. Let\u2019s do all of the projects. Let\u2019s do all of these things, because who knows what will happen?\n\nJones on personal style:\n\nI\u2019m obsessed with beauty, in that I like beautiful things. I love flowers, and so my office is full of plants. I love what it does for the air obviously, but it just makes me feel better. ... When my clients come to the office, I want them to feel kind of restored. I want them to feel calm; comforted. I want them to see that things are good over here. Regardless of what\u2019s happening over there, when you\u2019re in Jack Jones\u2019 office, things are beautiful. I want them to feel assured because it makes me feel assured. I love walking into my office. I love walking into my home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wardrobe is a good dress with florals, denim jacket and hoops. ... Always hoops, always lipstick, always a dress ... I got that from President Obama. One day, I was reading an interview he did, and he was just like, \u201cI have the nuclear codes, I have to make all these really important decisions for the world, I don\u2019t want to be worrying about what I\u2019m putting on.\u201d Every season, I get about five to 10 new, beautiful statement floral dresses, and I rotate those out throughout the season ... but I don\u2019t ever really worry about what I\u2019m putting on, because I know it\u2019s always going to be a dress.\n\nI read one time, Lena Horne, they asked her what her beauty secret is. And she said she eats a can of sardines a day for the omega-3s and for the fatty acids, and literally since then I\u2019ve eaten a can of sardines a day. And I read that when I was, like, 25. So I eat a can of sardines every morning. I want the Lena Horne situation!\n\n\n\nJones on inspiration:\n\nWhen I\u2019m feeling small and the world feels too big; when I am inconsolable; when I\u2019m not sure what my professional move is going to be or personal move is going to be; when language doesn\u2019t feel sufficient; when it just feels like all of the words aren\u2019t quite adequate to describe the thing that I am feeling, I can always read a Gwendolyn Brooks poem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s so much care there. ... And as you continue to read each Gwendolyn Brooks poem, you realize how much you\u2019re being built back up. And you begin to see the complexity ... like, \u201cOh, this poem is about poor people in a boarding house.\u201d But then you go through her book, and you go through these very different, complex relationships and this very complex world. So I always read Gwendolyn to put fat on my bones.\n\nJones on dressing for your body\u2014and yourself:\n\nFor me, my sartorial choices happen because people feel very specific ways about fat women and how fat women should and should not dress. What we should and should not wear. How busty women should and should not dress. Nappy-headed women. Dark-skinned women. And for me, I wear every shade of lipstick. I wear Afros, I wear braids, I wear my hair pinned up. ... I know my shape. I dress for my body. There are some things I\u2019m not going to wear just because I think it doesn\u2019t look good on my body, not because someone told me it doesn\u2019t look good on a fat body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not going to put on something to cover up the stretch marks on my arms. Instead, I\u2019m going to wear this really great dress. I\u2019m going to feel breezy, beautiful. And I\u2019m going to look gorgeous doing it.\n\nJones on her most anticipated book of 2018:\n\nRenee Simms\u2019 Meet Behind Mars is a gorgeous debut of short stories. I love it because she just talks about the complexity of everyday black life. Just really beautiful renderings of black family, of black womanhood, black girlhood ... you don\u2019t have to have black trauma to sell the book. I want a good story about black people trying to do the best they can, and I love that book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a great year for books. It has to be. A lot of poets, novelists and short story writers\u2014we were all enraged. I know I\u2019m not the only one who has the pedal to the metal. We were all, as the children say, pressed. Everyone was pressed. And I think a lot of great work got done.\n\nPublicity Assistant Allison Conner\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConner on joining Jack Jones:\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be frustrated at with the literary world, especially if you\u2019re a person of color or on the margins in any way. So it just felt amazing to work in my passion and also to work in a company that is aligned with my own values and with my own politics. It just makes the work even more special. We\u2019re publicizing books, we get to work with authors; that\u2019s great. I personally love that. But then, on top of it, we\u2019re championing people who mainstream literature wouldn\u2019t necessarily champion. That part of it is just, I always have to pinch myself. I feel very, very lucky to do this work.\n\nConner on the book that gave her life in 2017:\n\nOne thing I remember reading before I started at Jack Jones was Whatever Happened to Interracial Love, by Kathleen Collins. And that book floored me. ... The stories that she tells aren\u2019t necessarily thought of when you think of black fiction. You don\u2019t think of a teen girl up in her room reading theory and thinking about automatic writing and going to therapy. But that\u2019s who Kathleen Collins is writing about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConner on what she reads to restore herself:\n\nMosquito, by Gayl Jones\u2014one of my favorite writers in general. ... It goes beyond the page to make me think, \u201cOh, how do I carry myself? How can writing reflect a way that I would love to be in the world?\u201d ... It isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s kind of a difficult book to get into, and I like that in a sense of, don\u2019t apologize for your difficulties. Don\u2019t apologize for things that aren\u2019t as easy to consume or to explain. Keep those prickly parts of yourself because things can come from that. I really love that book for that reminder.\n\nConner on her style and beauty go-tos:\n\nI really love head wraps. \u2026 It\u2019s me being lazy\u2014you just put a head wrap on; that\u2019s really why I love them. ... I love colors, I love patterns. I love mixing all those things. The more color the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConner on book and beauty releases that got next:\n\nI definitely have my eye on the Fenty [Mattemoiselle] lipsticks ... for books coming out, I\u2019m really excited about this book by Akwaeke Emezi called Freshwater. ... It just seems like a really exciting book, and another kind of narrative\u2014[that] doesn\u2019t really get a lot of attention in the mainstream\u2014so I\u2019m really excited about that book.\n\nSpecial Programs Coordinator Amanda Choo Quan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuan on the books she loves:\n\nI\u2019m a mixed-race person, pretty multiracial\u2014which is not really unusual if you come from the Caribbean, and I\u2019m a light-skinned black person ... I recognize and acknowledge the privileges that come with being a light-skinned, mixed-race black person, so I love books that interrogate the nuances of that kind of identity and are really, really critical about the position that we hold. So, that said, I loved Danzy Senna\u2019s New People. Apart from it being incredibly hilarious, it\u2019s featuring black people who are kind of ... sometimes their politics are a little bit wonky. Sometimes they don\u2019t have it all together.\n\nQuan on writers who also serve style:\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to be Zadie Smith for a long time ... I love her head wraps; I love her freckles; I love her flared skirts\u2014they\u2019re great. I also really like Edwidge Danticat, the Haitian-American writer, just because I feel like style and beauty is also just about confidence and presence and that something. That sense of power. She just has so much presence.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuan on books that bring it home:\n\nI read a lot of Bhanu Kapil. I\u2019m thinking of her book The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers\u2014there\u2019s just something about her language that\u2019s just super captivating. There\u2019s [also] a book called Wide Sargasso Sea that was written by a Caribbean writer. ... It\u2019s a retelling of Jane Eyre, but from the perspective of a Bertha, the Creole woman locked in the attic ... I think I\u2019ve always wanted to be Janie from Their Eyes Were Watching God in her overalls ... I\u2019ve also thought [Toni Morrison\u2019s] Sula was an amazing, amazing human being that I\u2019ve always wanted to be.\n\nQuan on life at JJLA:\n\n[Kima] is always really, really, really well-dressed. Allison is also really well-dressed, so it\u2019s like, I know I need to step up my game. And it\u2019s also just showing that you care about each other. You care about each other, you care about the work you\u2019re doing, you take it seriously. That\u2019s why you want to be put together and presentable. ... It carries over into life outside of Jack Jones, which feels good as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Each interview has been edited and condensed.", "keywords": ["things", "wear", "authors", "love", "allfemale", "publishing", "feel", "black", "color", "team", "shine", "beautiful", "ensuring", "im", "bookish", "really", "book", "going", "jones"], "polarity": 0.23814095626595644, "subjectivity": 0.5576373857623859},

But men and women had very different reactions, to put it lightly.\n\nMany women applauded Jay\u2019s ability to finally take up the mantle of manhood and apologize for his bad behavior; for black women especially, there seemed to be a collective \u201cThank you!\u201d He had violated the trust of Queen Bey, and that was unacceptable. In the aftermath of the release, Candice Benbow\u2019s \u201c4:43\u201d spoke to nearly every black woman I know about what it means for men to finally reckon with honesty and faithfulness\u2014or not to\u2014at the expense of the women they claim to love.\n\nHowever, men weren\u2019t collectively as gracious, and although a 4:44 syllabus created by Anthony Boynton addressed issues of toxic masculinity and manhood, the reception from some men seemed to decry Jay as a \u201csellout\u201d to women. How dare he apologize? Maybe Bey wasn\u2019t doing her \u201cjob.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: GTFOH.]\n\nWith the appearance of writer and transgender activist Janet Mock as one of the \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d video, I couldn\u2019t help wondering: What are these same men thinking about Jay now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll confess that though I\u2019m a longtime fan of Jay-Z, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d Though Jay rarely has a misstep lyrically, the line \u201cLet me alone, Becky\u201d seems to completely place the blame for his affair or affairs on the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d rather than where it squarely needs to be: at Jay-Z\u2019s billionaire feet. In my opinion, it undermines the title track (\u201c4:44\u201d), where he actually apologizes and keeps the attention solely on his fuckboy behavior. So suffice it to say that when the video for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d debuted on Dec. 29, I wasn\u2019t too interested in checking it out.\n\nBut then I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s Jay. I got to.\u201d And I\u2019m happy that I did.\n\nTo start off, the choice to open the video with a quote by James Baldwin\u2014a queer black man\u2014is subversive in its own way. But then, when we time-travel to 2050 and the council of founding mothers, among the many famous faces, we see Janet Mock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting vibe when you watch a video intended to reveal a futuristic narrative about families feuding; I read the table of founding mothers as a collective of multihued women \u201csaving\u201d us from ourselves\u2014yet again. Some have expressed concern about the fact that there\u2019s no truly ebony woman at the table, which is an important conversation about colorism that needs to be addressed. And yet seeing Mock at the table as a fully participating part of the healing process made my masculine-of-center lesbian heart leap for joy!\n\nAs I replayed that section of the video, I wondered if Mock\u2019s inclusion was a result of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hand in the process, or was Jay giving a nod to us queer women\u2014cis and trans alike\u2014that yes, I see your womanhood? Hard to tell, but I\u2019ll take that win. Of course, that also means acknowledging the possibility of tokenism, which I\u2019m never in favor of.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that the entire video has moments that give us a wobbly understanding of futurism\u2014possibly Afro but certainly black American: a distinction that is important in the analysis of why it feels very American. For instance, the question of tokenism could also be raised when examining the inclusion of Native American actress Irene Bedard as one of the presidents in this futuristic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d beg to differ; for me, her appearance alongside Omari Hardwick was a reminder of the much-needed conversation that black Americans and Native Americans\u2014both of whom have been uniquely affected by colonization in the social project that is America\u2014need to have. It is important that they are sitting side by side, defending each other and having each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m going to optimistically err on the side of DuVernay\u2019s deft hand and say that tokenism isn\u2019t a part of Mock\u2019s inclusion. She belongs there because she is a woman. I hope Mock\u2019s presence among the founding mothers in this video signifies a shift away from the misogynoir and queer antagonism still present in contemporary hip-hop narratives. Maybe young men will take a note from an elder statesman and begin to understand their regressive ideologies.\n\nBut I can hardly see someone like black activists\u2019 fave Kendrick Lamar doing any work in this area. He can barely speak about cis black women in a positive manner, so I\u2019d be doubly surprised if he attempted to take on embracing queer and trans black women. I wondered as I watched this video\u2014do you have to get to almost 50 years old and out of the price range of Target runs to get some damn sense when it comes to love and womanhood?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find it telling that embracing queer women on an album where you are finally understanding that black women aren\u2019t the cocoons in which black men find their humanity feels like the next step in an evolution toward manhood. And when it comes to toxic masculinity and its relationship to womanhood, I\u2019m interested to see if Jay will, at some point, walk us through his understanding of the humanity of queer men as well.\n\nBut the presence of Janet Mock gives me hope. Not hope of acceptance\u2014that would just be empty rhetoric and truly a pitch to tokenism of the basest form. No, I hope that her presence is an acknowledgment of the personhood of queer folks. The ongoing murders of trans women\u2014particularly those of color\u2014speak to a deep and entrenched toxic combination of internalized racism and unhealthy masculinity that continues to inhabit our communities.\n\nIt\u2019s finally time for people to recognize that the most marginalized voices in the room\u2014those of trans women of color\u2014should be centered in our conversations when we are talking about getting free. Maybe our human family can stop the feuding over gender-identity labels and start thinking more broadly about what it means to be a man or a woman or genderqueer. That said, I\u2019m not going to label this video as a catalyst for that freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I am going to call it a start.", "keywords": ["jay", "feud", "women", "woman", "finally", "family", "makes", "trans", "tokenism", "major", "statement", "seat", "black", "jayzs", "queer", "belongs", "video", "im", "men", "table"], "polarity": 0.13311459667093473, "subjectivity": 0.527593896713615},

Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, the movie's three stars, were among the notable women on the panel, as well as the author of the book on which the movie is based, Margot Lee Shetterly.\n\nHidden Figures tells the incredible story of three brilliant African-American women\u2014Katherine Johnson (Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Mon\u00e1e)\u2014who worked at NASA and were the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The trio made history not only as women but as African-American women.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, the audience heard a bit about the lives and stories behind each character, especially concerning Katherine Johnson, who is celebrated in the film as the main source of intelligence behind one of the greatest operations in NASA history.\n\nHenson described Johnson as a courageous woman living in a time in history when accomplishments like hers were unheard of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You're talking about being the first woman in a room of all white men at a time where that was not popular.

The courage just to walk in that room speaks to her fearlessness, speaks to her tenacity, speaks to her brilliance.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you couldn't take her mind from her. You could call her all kinds of names and belittle her efforts, but she had a brilliant mind that God gave her. And she walked in that. She did not complain,\" Henson added.\n\nThe idea of Johnson not complaining was something that Henson emphasized and acknowledged that she learned and took away from in playing the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I use that in my life,\" she said. \"I don't complain about Hollywood. I don't say that they don't do this for black women and that and the third; I just keep working because one day you look up and you're a Golden Globe winner, you're Academy Award-nominated, but I couldn't get there by complaining.\"\n\nDorothy Vaughan, played by Spencer, was Johnson's supervisor, and Mary Jackson, played by Mon\u00e1e, was an engineer who also worked at the agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen speaking of these three historic and inspiring women, Michelle Obama underlined the great dedication each had to their field, as well as their ability to maintain their poise during the racism and sexism that they faced at the time.\n\n\"Now, these women couldn't even drink from the same water fountain or use the same bathroom as many of their colleagues,\" the first lady pointed out. \"And folks didn't always take these women seriously because they were black and also because they were women. \u2026 But they didn't listen to those doubters, you understand? They did not listen to the haters.\"\n\nThe event was held in front of a small audience, much of it high school and middle school students. And so, fittingly, one of the main themes that seemed to be seen throughout the presentation was the importance of hard work and how far it can get individuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What also matters is how hard you're willing to work,\" Michelle Obama said. \"Because none of this is easy, and it's not supposed to be.\"\n\nWhen discussing hard work, the first lady referenced her own husband, President Barack Obama, and his diligent work ethic and serious commitment to his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Look at this eight years,\" she said. \"We were supposed to be 'hidden.'
