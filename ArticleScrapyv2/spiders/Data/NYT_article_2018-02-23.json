People of all skill levels can get into winter sports like figure skating, bobsledding and, yes, even curling. Here\u2019s how. Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar trope heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang. The two-man event is the only bobsled competition in which women can participate at the Olympics. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["skating", "athletes", "bobsled", "united", "luge", "credit", "sport", "york", "started", "winter", "states", "olympic"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},

As they leaned hard and pumped their legs around one tight corner, a coach held a 9-year-old girl, standing on her skates, by the arms. With perfect timing, he flung her onto the ice, like a fisherman casting a net into the sea.\n\nThe rocket boost propelled her to speed and landed her in line with the boys, as if they all wore magnets.

She said she became a serious skier at age 13 by default. Vonn would like to be a multisport athlete, but her forays into tennis, figure skating, soccer and gymnastics were short-lived. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been good at anything but racing,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nA bronze medalist in the super-G at the 2010 Olympics, Vonn finished tied for sixth in the event last week. She was 38-hundredths of a second behind Ledecka, who came into the event ranked 43rd in the World Cup standings. Ledecka, racing in the 26th position, edged the defending Olympic champion, Austria\u2019s Anna Veith, by a hundredth of a second, or roughly the length of a finger.\n\nAfter posting the fastest clocking in the downhill portion of the combined event five days later, Vonn joked that her time had a chance to hold up since there were no snowboarders in the field.\n\n\u201cThe millennials are raw and inclusive, and trying other sports is important to them, as it should be,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI think maybe Ester can give them hope that competing and being successful in more than one sport is possible. I think she definitely will have a long-lasting impact.\u201d\n\nMikaela Shiffrin, a three-time Olympic medalist who races in each of the five Alpine disciplines, called Ledecka \u201can incredible example\u201d for young athletes.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t just specify Alpine skiing in her sports repertoire when she was 8 years old because she wanted to be an Olympic champion,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cShe was doing a lot of things. She can find the similarities between her sports and actually help build and improve with one sport off of the other.\u201d\n\nEvidence abounds that delaying sports specialization until an athlete\u2019s teenage years minimizes the risk of overuse injuries and emotional burnout. Felix McGrath, a 1988 United States Olympian in Alpine skiing, was a four-sport athlete in high school. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing what she has done, but would have liked to have given it a try,\u201d said McGrath, who attended Middlebury College and coaches skiing in Norway, his wife\u2019s home country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI love the fact that Ester is a multisport athlete,\u201d McGrath said in an email. \u201cI have many problems with what is going on with youth sports in general. In Norway and the U.S.A., specializing in one sport at a very young age \u2014 before 13 \u2014 has become common.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMcGrath played soccer, tennis and golf during skiing\u2019s off-season to maintain his connection to nature and to his fitness. Shiffrin sees other, less obvious benefits to Ledecka\u2019s dual existence. She spoke of the jaw-dropping lines that Ledecka carves on Alpine courses, a knack that Ledecka\u2019s snowboarding coach, Justin Reiter, attributes to her experience maneuvering on a snowboard, which, because it has no steadying or stabilizing poles, requires seeing a mountain in a more imaginative way.\n\nShiffrin, 22, recalled a downhill training run in Lake Louise, Alberta, in November. Ledecka recorded the fastest time, she said, and \u201ceverybody stopped and jaws dropped, like that run isn\u2019t supposed to be skied that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made everybody think about how much better we could all ski the course,\u201d Shiffrin added.\n\nReiter, a retired snowboarding Olympian, said the 5-foot-7 Ledecka instinctively has a great feel for the snow under her feet. She also has a pretty good pedigree: Her maternal grandfather was an Olympic medalist in ice hockey in 1964 and 1968.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She acts like every day is a race day.\u201d\n\nTrapp, 29, started out in all five snowboarding disciplines but was encouraged by his coaches to choose freestyle or racing. If he were a young kid now, he said, he might be inspired by Ledecka\u2019s example \u201cto try more disciplines and stick with more disciplines.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018No, I want to do what I want to do\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s kind of her motto,\u201d Trapp said.\n\nThe evolution of sports is driven by athletes whose unique vision opens everyone else\u2019s eyes to what is possible. Ledecka is a throwback outlier, someone whose refusal to specialize has a back-to-the-future feel \u2014 and appeal. Shiffrin watched Ledecka\u2019s super-G run and knew she was seeing something special.\n\n\u201cI was screaming and crying when she came down and won that gold,\u201d she said.

NBC\u2019s prime-time ratings are down, too, about 16 percent from four years ago, though according to Total Audience Delivery, NBC\u2019s preferred measuring stick and the one it used to sell ads for the Games, viewership is only down 8 percent over all.\n\nBut another barometer could be telling, too, of the Olympics\u2019 popularity: Most of the viral hits online from the Games, according to data from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, have little to do with athletic achievement. These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience.\n\nOf the accounts that CrowdTangle tracks, some of the top Facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from Feb. 9 to 21 included memes (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized drones from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman \u201cpracticing\u201d the sport of curling with a Roomba and two trailers for \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d which premiered during the Games.\n\nWhile the Roomba curler did indeed \u201churry hard,\u201d here are the other Olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they intended.\n\nImage Chloe Kim of the United States during her halfpipe gold medal run.

Kim, who missed qualifying for the 2014 Olympics because she was too young, easily won the halfpipe snowboard competition.\n\nBut let\u2019s just say they are also very much teenagers.\n\nGerard stayed up late watching \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d on Netflix and slept through his alarm the day of his gold medal run. He called his morning \u201chectic.\u201d\n\nAfter winning the gold, he promptly let out an expletive heard on television.

But both had garnered news media attention as openly gay, outspoken members of the American team. Before the American delegation entered the opening ceremony, which Vice President Mike Pence attended, Kenworthy tweeted:\n\nIt went viral.\n\nFour days later, after winning a bronze medal in the figure skating team competition \u2014 and incurring the wrath of internet trolls \u2014 Rippon wrote on Twitter:\n\nAnother viral moment.\n\nRippon and Kenworthy then received the ultimate good-luck charm and another bump of social excitement: a tweet from Britney Spears.\n\nKenworthy had a disappointing 12th-place finish, but found his own shining moment. Unbeknown to him, cameras caught him kissing his boyfriend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something I had as a kid,\u201d Kenworthy told the New York Times reporter Karen Crouse. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a gay athlete at the Olympics kissing their boyfriend.

They included Pita Taufatofua of Tonga, Sebastian Uprimny of Colombia and, por fin, German Madrazo of Mexico. Madrazo told reporters he had learned to ski only a year ago. Taufatofua skied on snow for the first time a few months before the Games.\n\nThe group lifted Madrazo on its shoulders when he crossed the finish line almost 26 minutes after Cologna won the race.\n\nThe underdogs instantly became fan favorites and a symbol of the Olympics, which posted a photo of Madrazo carrying the Mexican flag on its social media accounts, where it generated tens of thousands of likes.\n\nImage Shaun White regained his men's halfpipe crown.

From Feb. 9 to 21, White was the most talked about athlete on Facebook, according to the company. (Facebook will release more complete data after the conclusion of the Games.) White was also the most mentioned athlete on Facebook during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, even though he failed to win a medal.\n\nBut the discussion this time was not all about White\u2019s athletic achievements. On the heels of his gold medal performance, he was asked about past sexual harassment allegations. Those allegations, and his responses, kept him in the limelight online in the days after his win.\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

Historically speaking, it is a nation of broom-wielding, rock-shoving wizards. Their Olympic trials are the most competitive curling competition on the planet. Plus, the sport is played on ice, and Canada is pretty good at stuff that involves ice.\n\nEntering these Games, Canadians had never gone without a medal in any curling event since the sport made its debut at the 1998 Winter Olympics. They were 10 for 10, a stretch of dominance that included the last three gold medals in the men\u2019s competition.\n\nSo to do what they did here (or didn\u2019t do here) would be comparable to the United States men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams failing to win a medal at the Summer Olympics. But just as basketball has become a global sport, with improved competition from countries like Spain and Serbia, curling has benefited from increased popularity around the world.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Female elite skiers must eat about 3,500 to 4,000 calories a day \u2014 about double the calories consumed by the average woman. (A Swedish study found that during the hardest training days it can reach 8,126 for men and 4,780 for women \u2014 about double the calorie needs of Kenyan marathon runners.)\n\nWhat does it take to consume 8,000 calories \u2014 the equivalent of about 20 plates of lasagna or 40 scoops of ice cream \u2014 every day?\n\nPhoto\n\nFor cross-country skiers, who often have slim builds and limited stomach capacity, it means eating several times a day, and often planning their schedules around their constant meals. Many have tricks to help them fuel \u2014 they eat mashed foods, high-calorie bars, calorie-laden sports drinks; they carry backpacks full of beef jerky and almonds, and they always take dessert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m laughing about it and at myself because it feels normal,\u201d said Caitlin Patterson, 28, an American skier who finished 34th out of 62 in the 15-kilometer women\u2019s skiathlon. \u201cIt is something we think about a lot of the time,\u201d she said, as she snacked on beef jerky after a workout at the Olympic cross-country center. \u201cIt\u2019s an important part of your job because fueling is so important for your physical performance.\u201d\n\nPatterson, who is 5-foot-9 and about 132 pounds, estimates she takes in up to 3,500 calories a day depending on her training level. Fueling starts with a breakfast of two eggs fried in butter topped with melted Vermont Cheddar, plus two pieces of toast with jam and no guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s a good combination of the nutrients that I need to get through the training,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter morning training she quickly eats about 300 calories in snacks \u2014 beef jerky, almonds, a few Fig Newtons and maybe an orange. She eats lunch when she gets home. A big salad with maple-mustard dressing, a grilled cheese sandwich or quesadillas, followed by a cookie or a bowl of Ben and Jerry\u2019s milk and cookies ice cream. After a few hours rest, it\u2019s time to start thinking about eating again for her afternoon training.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Ola Ronsen, chief medical officer for the Norwegian Ski Federation, said that on many days the athletes simply cannot eat enough. Research has shown some may fall as much as 1,000 calories short of their body\u2019s daily needs. As a result, it is important that they keep up the same eating routine on their days off to make up the deficit.\n\nThe problem, said Ronsen, is that many athletes feel full before they have entirely replaced the energy loss of training. \u201cWhen you train you take a lot of energy from the muscles,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you are replacing that, you\u2019re using your stomach and gut to process the food before it\u2019s brought back via circulation to your muscles. You\u2019ve filled up your stomach, but feeling full is not always a reliable signal that it\u2019s enough for the muscles to replace the glycogen.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Now?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have to go out with the kids, I often say, \u2018We have to wait. I have to eat.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoeller, who is six feet tall and about 176 pounds, says he trains four to five hours a day and takes in about 8,000 calories a day, following a rigorous eating schedule to get it all into his body. In addition to eating a large breakfast (fried eggs, oatmeal and white beans), lunch (pasta with meat sauce, pan-fried fish and salad) and dinner (double servings of whatever his family is eating), he eats two smaller pre-training meals, two small recovery meals and a small extra meal before bedtime (any combination of oatmeal, bread, cheese, ham, honey, sports drinks and sometimes cheesecake or chocolate cake or a doughnut if he wants it.)\n\nThis summer, Moeller adjusted his diet to eliminate sugar and focus on only so-called \u201chealthful\u2019 foods. \u201cI lost a little weight but I was not skiing faster \u2014 I was skiing slower,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe decided to go back to eating whatever and whenever he felt like. \u201cWhen you have to eat a lot, you have to eat the stuff you like to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not eating cake all the time of course. You need to eat all the healthy stuff. But it\u2019s not good to say this is something I can\u2019t eat. If you want a doughnut or a Coke, you get a lot of calories like that and you recover much faster. It\u2019s better than eating less.\u201d\n\nDuring weeks of strenuous training during the season, the athletes are pushing so hard that their bodies begin to release hormones that suppress appetite, making it an even bigger challenge to get the necessary nutrients. \u201cIf you come to a point where the training is so hard your desire to eat goes down, that\u2019s a critical balance,\u201d Ronsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate situation. You really have to force yourself to eat even though you don\u2019t feel like you are hungry anymore.\u201d\n\nSusie Parker-Simmons, a senior nutritionist for the United States Olympic Committee, says that meeting the calorie demands of the sport can be especially challenging for women, who can lose their menstrual cycle and bone mineral density if their eating falls behind. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard to get that amount of calories in,\u201d she said. During a team event in Switzerland, she worked with the athletes to help them fuel, recommending that they take in calorie-dense foods right after training like sports drinks and gels, Clif bars, smoothies and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018If you come look after us we\u2019ll just eat or drink what you give us,\u2019\u201d she said of the American skiers\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLinda Bakkman, a sports nutritionist with the Swedish Olympic Committee, said that even Olympic athletes must contend with cultural biases around eating high-calorie foods. \u201cYou can\u2019t meet the energy requirement of being a cross-country skier with salad,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is an educational challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish cross-country skier Daniel Rickardsson, 35, who won Bronze in the 15-kilometer event in Sochi in 2014 and who will compete in the grueling 50 kilometer on Saturday, said that fuel is a constant need. During a race, which can last a few hours, he needs to consume about 100 grams of carbohydrates every 15 to 20 minutes. A crew member hands him a high-concentrate sports drink at regular intervals on the course.\n\nIt helps that he spends time with teammates who also eat three regular meals each day (porridge, cheese and meat sandwiches, quinoa, tuna, chicken, vegetables) plus six small meals including one before bedtime (high-protein yogurt, banana, eggs, cheese sandwiches.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s breakfast, training, lunch, rest, eating, training, eating and rest and eating,\u201d Rickardsson said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\nFor Moeller of Denmark, who finished about six minutes behind the winner in the men\u2019s 15-kilometer freestyle cross-country event, Pyeongchang is likely to be his last international competition, although he still plans to continue skiing and to run marathons. \u201cBut I\u2019m looking forward to relaxing and not training so much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll eat a lot less.\u201d", "keywords": ["exhausting", "calories", "training", "day", "eating", "crosscountry", "8000", "skier", "meals", "skiers", "athletes", "lot", "eat", "olympic"], "polarity": 0.05209144110659261, "subjectivity": 0.35990300384239804},

The flower kids, also called sweepers, stand out not only for their matching lavender outfits \u2014 color coordinated with the rink\u2019s purple Zambonis \u2014 but also for their quickness and skill navigating the ice. During competitions, the sweepers sit in a group at the edge of the rink, clapping to the music and cheering the athletes.

It needs to create an independent worldwide antidoping task force, with enough financing behind it to make it work.\n\nThe I.O.C. will have to demand that all national Olympic committees and sports federations pitch in, but it needs to reach deeper into its own pockets, too. NBC Universal has committed nearly $8 billion for the media rights for the Games from 2021 through 2032. That\u2019s a lot of money for the I.O.C. to throw around, and right now seems like the right time to throw a lot more of it at antidoping.\n\nAhead of these Winter Games, the I.O.C. talked a big talk to clean up Olympic sports, yet allowed Russia to send one of the largest contingents to these Games, and then approved a \u201cneutral\u201d uniform with the word \u201cRussia\u201d on it.\n\nSo what\u2019s the sense in letting the I.O.C. pretend to be a hard-liner on doping now that the Games are almost done by keeping the Russian flag out of the closing ceremony? The fact that it\u2019s even considering reinstatement, or the laughable partial reinstatement options, shows it still isn\u2019t serious about punishing nations that cheat to win.\n\nRussians won 13 medals through the first 13 days of the Games. None were gold, though that is likely to change when the women\u2019s figure skating is decided Friday morning here. But the Russians were awarded four silvers and nine bronzes, and that\u2019s still something.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut you can\u2019t help but wonder, given Russia\u2019s history, if some of the athletes who finished behind them were robbed again. We know at least two Norwegians who\u2019ve already had their medal moment stolen.\n\nThey blame Alexander Krushelnytsky, a Russian curler. When Krushelnytsky, a bronze medalist in mixed doubles curling, tested positive here for the banned drug meldonium, he at first denied taking the drug. Russian officials claimed sabotage, an unoriginal excuse. Elite athletes here keep close tabs on what they eat and drink, and they don\u2019t leave their water bottles just anywhere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think having a Russian that has tested positive is not a good thing,\u201d said Angela Ruggiero, the chairwoman of the I.O.C.\u2019s athletes\u2019 commission and a four-time Olympian in hockey. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want any athletes testing positive, but in this particular situation, where they\u2019re under a microscope, it does raise questions.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Krushelnytsky stopped fighting his case and abandoned his appeal. He and his teammate will lose their bronze medals, dropping Russia to just 12 medals won here. And while the Norwegians who finished fourth will get those bronzes, they said this week that they still felt \u201crobbed of their moment of glory.\u201d\n\nSo after a positive drug test, why is the I.O.C. even debating whether Russia should march under its flag on Sunday? Sam Edney, a Canadian luger, said the Russian curler\u2019s doping positive should guarantee that the Russian flag never waves inside the stadium. He has reason to be annoyed.\n\nEdney was part of a team that finished fourth in Sochi, while a Russian team won silver. The Russian squad was later stripped of the medal for doping, meaning Edney and the Canadians would move up to bronze. But then the silver medal was reinstated just before these Games after the Russians won an appeal.\n\nEdney\u2019s roller coaster is one no athlete should be forced to ride. The I.O.C., he wrote on Twitter, \u201cneeds to make a statement that enough is enough.\u201d\n\nThe Russians celebrated in Sochi, and they will celebrate here, too. They have been waving their flag in the stands and painting \u201cRussia\u201d on their faces.\n\nRussian journalists showed up at figure skating this week wearing T-shirts that said, \u201cI Don\u2019t Do Doping,\u201d even as the evidence clearly showed that, actually, Russians did \u201cdo doping.\u201d Again.\n\nMaybe they should let the whole Russian team wear those shirts on Sunday.

Credit Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nThose fans clearly hoped to see a sweep, with such a high caliber of American athletes in the field. But this is halfpipe, where it is common for the mighty to literally fall (as Blunck, 21, of Crested Butte, Colo., did in his second run, and Wise did in his first two runs only to recover with a jaw-dropping final go that bested the others.)\n\nWise chalked that up to the nature of the sport, in which each run can demand more awe as skiers execute complicated spins and switchbacks in an effort to top one another\u2019s tricks.\n\nHe acknowledged that there was a lot of hype heading into the event, but the team sought to keep it out of their heads on their runs.\n\n\u201cSharing the top two steps of that podium with Alex is amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is the other guys had the opportunity. Aaron Blunck had the opportunity. Torin Yater-Wallace had the opportunity to take that spot away from Nico, and they didn\u2019t do it. So I\u2019m excited for skiing to look as good as it did today.\u201d\n\nTheir 1-2 finish certainly gave a jolt to the United States\u2019 medal count, which through Thursday\u2019s events stood at 21 medals over all and eight gold. With just a few days left of competition, the Americans seemed on pace to lag behind Sochi\u2019s disappointing total of 28 medals, nine of them gold.\n\nStill, five of the United States\u2019 eight golds have come in halfpipe or slopestyle events. In total, snowboard and freestyle skiing accounts for 10 of the United States\u2019 21 medals.\n\n\u201cHalfpipe really caters to creativity,\u201d Wise said. \u201cIt caters to doing things sort of differently than anybody else does. I think as Americans we have rebel in our blood.\u201d\n\nWise used three different pairs of skis because he had binding problems on the first two runs, leading to wipeouts. He scored 17 on the first and 6.4 on the second before performing a near-perfect run on the third for a 97.20. He landed double corks in all four directions: front left, front right, switch backward left and switch right, which basically means he spun ridiculously high and twirled in nerve-racking succession off the halfpipe banks as if he were on a frosty trampoline.\n\nFerreira had a 96.4, and Porteous a 94.8 after trying a succession of moves he said he had never done before.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re at the Olympics, you just go for it,\u201d Porteous said.\n\nHe took note of the American skiers and the hype about them completely dominating the event.\n\n\u201cIt would have been cool to see the U.S.A. sweep, but I\u2019m a really proud Kiwi right now,\u201d he said.\n\nYater-Wallace, who overcame a hard-luck string of injury and illness to make the team, finished ninth, with a score no higher than a 65.2.\n\n\u201cIt was a fight; it\u2019s always a fight,\u201d he said.\n\nWise said he drew strength from watching other skiers\u2019 runs.\n\n\u201cIt gave me a little bit of a boost,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to to say, Hey, Alex has already crushed it.

It might be a stretch to assume that academy voters are paying much mind to Russian news sites, but Mr. Fayyad believes that detractors, in their fervor to discredit the White Helmets, are also aiming to derail his film\u2019s Oscar chances, something he is trying to offset by sounding the alarm.\n\nMr. Fayyad is from the countryside outside Aleppo and, in March 2011, was working on another film, about the 1982 massacre in the city of Hama, when Syria\u2019s civil uprising began. Mr. Fayyad was arrested \u2014 he was accused of spreading false news, he said \u2014 imprisoned and tortured. (His nails were ripped out, he was shackled and hung by his hands from a ceiling, and sensitive parts of his body were shocked with electricity, he said.)\n\nFor all the horrors he suffered, Mr. Fayyad was struck by his fellow prisoners\u2019 resistance and determination to survive, and how they buoyed each other by singing songs in the lowest of voices. Nearly a year later, he emerged wanting to make a film that showed how people endured in the teeth of war, and clung to the tiniest glimmers of solace and hope.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell the story of the White Helmets; I wanted to tell the story about these people as citizens of their society,\u201d Mr. Fayyad said. But accompanying the men on their gruesome rescue missions took a harrowing toll. \u201cIt kills something inside you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a film about our nightmare.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile the film\u2019s producer and assistant director were recently denied visas to attend the Academy Awards, Mr. Fayyad could take comfort in the fact that the White Helmets have already received the endorsement of the academy; last year, a short documentary about the group landed an Oscar. It would be something if another film about the White Helmets won, though the lighthearted \u201cFaces Places\u201d is currently the favorite. In the end, we will probably never know whether Russians will manage to sway academy voters.

She was already a two-time world champion, undefeated in two years, increasingly graceful as an artist and technically savvy in her jumping. But skating can be a ruthless sport. And now Medvedeva\u2019s time may have gone before it arrived.\n\nShe could still win gold on Friday, skating as Tolstoy\u2019s tragic Anna Karenina. She sits in second place, only 1.3 points behind her training partner in Moscow, the 15-year-old Alina Zagitova. It would be premature to count Medvedeva out. But there is something awakening in Zagitova. She defeated Medvedeva last month at the European championships. In Wednesday\u2019s short program, Medvedeva set a world record for points. Ten minutes later, Zagitova broke it.\n\nStill, Medvedeva will be a central figure at these Games, gold medal or not.\n\nIt was Medvedeva who helped to argue \u2014 successfully \u2014 in December before the International Olympic Committee that not all Russian athletes should be banned from these Games because of systematic doping orchestrated at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe laughs often and speaks comfortably with reporters in both Russian and English. Her career path was set at age 11, when Medvedeva competed for the first time at the Russian national championships. \u201cI realized then, this is what I wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be good.\u201d\n\nUntil Medvedeva lost to Zagitova at the European championships, she had been remarkably consistent, undefeated since November 2015. When she fell on a double axel in a competition in Moscow in October, it was such a rare and unexpected spill that Medvedeva called it a moment of \u201cmoral weakness.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is such a fierce competitor; I love that,\u201d said Brian Orser, the coach of the two-time Olympic men\u2019s champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan. \u201cThere\u2019s a very youthful passion about her skating.

People of all skill levels can get into winter sports like figure skating, bobsledding and, yes, even curling. Here\u2019s how. Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar trope heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang. The two-man event is the only bobsled competition in which women can participate at the Olympics. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["skating", "athletes", "bobsled", "united", "luge", "credit", "sport", "york", "started", "winter", "states", "olympic"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},

She was 38-hundredths of a second behind Ledecka, who came into the event ranked 43rd in the World Cup standings. Ledecka, racing in the 26th position, edged the defending Olympic champion, Austria\u2019s Anna Veith, by a hundredth of a second, or roughly the length of a finger.\n\nAfter posting the fastest clocking in the downhill portion of the combined event five days later, Vonn joked that her time had a chance to hold up since there were no snowboarders in the field.\n\n\u201cThe millennials are raw and inclusive, and trying other sports is important to them, as it should be,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI think maybe Ester can give them hope that competing and being successful in more than one sport is possible. I think she definitely will have a long-lasting impact.\u201d\n\nMikaela Shiffrin, a three-time Olympic medalist who races in each of the five Alpine disciplines, called Ledecka \u201can incredible example\u201d for young athletes.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t just specify Alpine skiing in her sports repertoire when she was 8 years old because she wanted to be an Olympic champion,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cShe was doing a lot of things. She can find the similarities between her sports and actually help build and improve with one sport off of the other.\u201d\n\nEvidence abounds that delaying sports specialization until an athlete\u2019s teenage years minimizes the risk of overuse injuries and emotional burnout. Felix McGrath, a 1988 United States Olympian in Alpine skiing, was a four-sport athlete in high school. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing what she has done, but would have liked to have given it a try,\u201d said McGrath, who attended Middlebury College and coaches skiing in Norway, his wife\u2019s home country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI love the fact that Ester is a multisport athlete,\u201d McGrath said in an email. \u201cI have many problems with what is going on with youth sports in general. In Norway and the U.S.A., specializing in one sport at a very young age \u2014 before 13 \u2014 has become common.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMcGrath played soccer, tennis and golf during skiing\u2019s off-season to maintain his connection to nature and to his fitness. Shiffrin sees other, less obvious benefits to Ledecka\u2019s dual existence. She spoke of the jaw-dropping lines that Ledecka carves on Alpine courses, a knack that Ledecka\u2019s snowboarding coach, Justin Reiter, attributes to her experience maneuvering on a snowboard, which, because it has no steadying or stabilizing poles, requires seeing a mountain in a more imaginative way.\n\nShiffrin, 22, recalled a downhill training run in Lake Louise, Alberta, in November. Ledecka recorded the fastest time, she said, and \u201ceverybody stopped and jaws dropped, like that run isn\u2019t supposed to be skied that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made everybody think about how much better we could all ski the course,\u201d Shiffrin added.\n\nReiter, a retired snowboarding Olympian, said the 5-foot-7 Ledecka instinctively has a great feel for the snow under her feet. She also has a pretty good pedigree: Her maternal grandfather was an Olympic medalist in ice hockey in 1964 and 1968.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She acts like every day is a race day.\u201d\n\nTrapp, 29, started out in all five snowboarding disciplines but was encouraged by his coaches to choose freestyle or racing.

Ledecka is a throwback outlier, someone whose refusal to specialize has a back-to-the-future feel \u2014 and appeal. Shiffrin watched Ledecka\u2019s super-G run and knew she was seeing something special.\n\n\u201cI was screaming and crying when she came down and won that gold,\u201d she said.

These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience.\n\nOf the accounts that CrowdTangle tracks, some of the top Facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from Feb. 9 to 21 included memes (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized drones from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman \u201cpracticing\u201d the sport of curling with a Roomba and two trailers for \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d which premiered during the Games.\n\nWhile the Roomba curler did indeed \u201churry hard,\u201d here are the other Olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they intended.\n\nImage Chloe Kim of the United States during her halfpipe gold medal run.

Gerard aced his slopestyle snowboard performance, becoming the youngest snowboarding gold medalist. Kim, who missed qualifying for the 2014 Olympics because she was too young, easily won the halfpipe snowboard competition.\n\nBut let\u2019s just say they are also very much teenagers.\n\nGerard stayed up late watching \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d on Netflix and slept through his alarm the day of his gold medal run. He called his morning \u201chectic.\u201d\n\nAfter winning the gold, he promptly let out an expletive heard on television. The internet found its first hero of the Games.\n\nFor her part, Kim did not finish her breakfast sandwich the morning of her event, tweeting she was \u201changry\u201d (a combination of hungry and angry) minutes before her gold medal performance.\n\nAccording to Twitter, Kim had 15,000 followers before the tweet, and 100,000 new followers after it:\n\nImage Adam Rippon of the United States performing in the men's free skate.

But both had garnered news media attention as openly gay, outspoken members of the American team. Before the American delegation entered the opening ceremony, which Vice President Mike Pence attended, Kenworthy tweeted:\n\nIt went viral.\n\nFour days later, after winning a bronze medal in the figure skating team competition \u2014 and incurring the wrath of internet trolls \u2014 Rippon wrote on Twitter:\n\nAnother viral moment.\n\nRippon and Kenworthy then received the ultimate good-luck charm and another bump of social excitement: a tweet from Britney Spears.\n\nKenworthy had a disappointing 12th-place finish, but found his own shining moment. Unbeknown to him, cameras caught him kissing his boyfriend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something I had as a kid,\u201d Kenworthy told the New York Times reporter Karen Crouse. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a gay athlete at the Olympics kissing their boyfriend. I think if I had it would have made it a lot easier for me.\u201d\n\nGerman Madrazo and Pita Taufatofua\n\nIn the men\u2019s 15-kilometer cross-country race, Dario Cologna of Switzerland won the gold, Simen Hegstad Kruger of Norway took silver and Denis Spitsov, a Russian, earned the bronze.\n\nBut it was the last finishers \u2014 not the first \u2014 who created the race\u2019s most memorable moment. They included Pita Taufatofua of Tonga, Sebastian Uprimny of Colombia and, por fin, German Madrazo of Mexico. Madrazo told reporters he had learned to ski only a year ago. Taufatofua skied on snow for the first time a few months before the Games.\n\nThe group lifted Madrazo on its shoulders when he crossed the finish line almost 26 minutes after Cologna won the race.\n\nThe underdogs instantly became fan favorites and a symbol of the Olympics, which posted a photo of Madrazo carrying the Mexican flag on its social media accounts, where it generated tens of thousands of likes.\n\nImage Shaun White regained his men's halfpipe crown. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nShaun White\n\nWhen the halfpipe snowboard king Shaun White regained his Olympic crown, he also returned to the top of social. But not only for his performance.\n\nAccording to CrowdTangle, four of the top 15 Instagram posts on the Olympics were posted by Shaun White. From Feb. 9 to 21, White was the most talked about athlete on Facebook, according to the company. (Facebook will release more complete data after the conclusion of the Games.) White was also the most mentioned athlete on Facebook during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, even though he failed to win a medal.\n\nBut the discussion this time was not all about White\u2019s athletic achievements. On the heels of his gold medal performance, he was asked about past sexual harassment allegations. Those allegations, and his responses, kept him in the limelight online in the days after his win.\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

Historically speaking, it is a nation of broom-wielding, rock-shoving wizards. Their Olympic trials are the most competitive curling competition on the planet. Plus, the sport is played on ice, and Canada is pretty good at stuff that involves ice.\n\nEntering these Games, Canadians had never gone without a medal in any curling event since the sport made its debut at the 1998 Winter Olympics. They were 10 for 10, a stretch of dominance that included the last three gold medals in the men\u2019s competition.\n\nSo to do what they did here (or didn\u2019t do here) would be comparable to the United States men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams failing to win a medal at the Summer Olympics. But just as basketball has become a global sport, with improved competition from countries like Spain and Serbia, curling has benefited from increased popularity around the world.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Female elite skiers must eat about 3,500 to 4,000 calories a day \u2014 about double the calories consumed by the average woman. (A Swedish study found that during the hardest training days it can reach 8,126 for men and 4,780 for women \u2014 about double the calorie needs of Kenyan marathon runners.)\n\nWhat does it take to consume 8,000 calories \u2014 the equivalent of about 20 plates of lasagna or 40 scoops of ice cream \u2014 every day?\n\nPhoto\n\nFor cross-country skiers, who often have slim builds and limited stomach capacity, it means eating several times a day, and often planning their schedules around their constant meals. Many have tricks to help them fuel \u2014 they eat mashed foods, high-calorie bars, calorie-laden sports drinks; they carry backpacks full of beef jerky and almonds, and they always take dessert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m laughing about it and at myself because it feels normal,\u201d said Caitlin Patterson, 28, an American skier who finished 34th out of 62 in the 15-kilometer women\u2019s skiathlon. \u201cIt is something we think about a lot of the time,\u201d she said, as she snacked on beef jerky after a workout at the Olympic cross-country center. \u201cIt\u2019s an important part of your job because fueling is so important for your physical performance.\u201d\n\nPatterson, who is 5-foot-9 and about 132 pounds, estimates she takes in up to 3,500 calories a day depending on her training level. Fueling starts with a breakfast of two eggs fried in butter topped with melted Vermont Cheddar, plus two pieces of toast with jam and no guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s a good combination of the nutrients that I need to get through the training,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter morning training she quickly eats about 300 calories in snacks \u2014 beef jerky, almonds, a few Fig Newtons and maybe an orange. She eats lunch when she gets home.

After a few hours rest, it\u2019s time to start thinking about eating again for her afternoon training.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Ola Ronsen, chief medical officer for the Norwegian Ski Federation, said that on many days the athletes simply cannot eat enough. Research has shown some may fall as much as 1,000 calories short of their body\u2019s daily needs. As a result, it is important that they keep up the same eating routine on their days off to make up the deficit.\n\nThe problem, said Ronsen, is that many athletes feel full before they have entirely replaced the energy loss of training. \u201cWhen you train you take a lot of energy from the muscles,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you are replacing that, you\u2019re using your stomach and gut to process the food before it\u2019s brought back via circulation to your muscles. You\u2019ve filled up your stomach, but feeling full is not always a reliable signal that it\u2019s enough for the muscles to replace the glycogen.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Now?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have to go out with the kids, I often say, \u2018We have to wait. I have to eat.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoeller, who is six feet tall and about 176 pounds, says he trains four to five hours a day and takes in about 8,000 calories a day, following a rigorous eating schedule to get it all into his body. In addition to eating a large breakfast (fried eggs, oatmeal and white beans), lunch (pasta with meat sauce, pan-fried fish and salad) and dinner (double servings of whatever his family is eating), he eats two smaller pre-training meals, two small recovery meals and a small extra meal before bedtime (any combination of oatmeal, bread, cheese, ham, honey, sports drinks and sometimes cheesecake or chocolate cake or a doughnut if he wants it.)\n\nThis summer, Moeller adjusted his diet to eliminate sugar and focus on only so-called \u201chealthful\u2019 foods. \u201cI lost a little weight but I was not skiing faster \u2014 I was skiing slower,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe decided to go back to eating whatever and whenever he felt like. \u201cWhen you have to eat a lot, you have to eat the stuff you like to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not eating cake all the time of course. You need to eat all the healthy stuff. But it\u2019s not good to say this is something I can\u2019t eat. If you want a doughnut or a Coke, you get a lot of calories like that and you recover much faster. It\u2019s better than eating less.\u201d\n\nDuring weeks of strenuous training during the season, the athletes are pushing so hard that their bodies begin to release hormones that suppress appetite, making it an even bigger challenge to get the necessary nutrients. \u201cIf you come to a point where the training is so hard your desire to eat goes down, that\u2019s a critical balance,\u201d Ronsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate situation. You really have to force yourself to eat even though you don\u2019t feel like you are hungry anymore.\u201d\n\nSusie Parker-Simmons, a senior nutritionist for the United States Olympic Committee, says that meeting the calorie demands of the sport can be especially challenging for women, who can lose their menstrual cycle and bone mineral density if their eating falls behind. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard to get that amount of calories in,\u201d she said. During a team event in Switzerland, she worked with the athletes to help them fuel, recommending that they take in calorie-dense foods right after training like sports drinks and gels, Clif bars, smoothies and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018If you come look after us we\u2019ll just eat or drink what you give us,\u2019\u201d she said of the American skiers\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLinda Bakkman, a sports nutritionist with the Swedish Olympic Committee, said that even Olympic athletes must contend with cultural biases around eating high-calorie foods. \u201cYou can\u2019t meet the energy requirement of being a cross-country skier with salad,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is an educational challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish cross-country skier Daniel Rickardsson, 35, who won Bronze in the 15-kilometer event in Sochi in 2014 and who will compete in the grueling 50 kilometer on Saturday, said that fuel is a constant need. During a race, which can last a few hours, he needs to consume about 100 grams of carbohydrates every 15 to 20 minutes. A crew member hands him a high-concentrate sports drink at regular intervals on the course.\n\nIt helps that he spends time with teammates who also eat three regular meals each day (porridge, cheese and meat sandwiches, quinoa, tuna, chicken, vegetables) plus six small meals including one before bedtime (high-protein yogurt, banana, eggs, cheese sandwiches.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s breakfast, training, lunch, rest, eating, training, eating and rest and eating,\u201d Rickardsson said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\nFor Moeller of Denmark, who finished about six minutes behind the winner in the men\u2019s 15-kilometer freestyle cross-country event, Pyeongchang is likely to be his last international competition, although he still plans to continue skiing and to run marathons. \u201cBut I\u2019m looking forward to relaxing and not training so much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll eat a lot less.\u201d", "keywords": ["exhausting", "calories", "training", "day", "eating", "crosscountry", "8000", "skier", "meals", "skiers", "athletes", "lot", "eat", "olympic"], "polarity": 0.05209144110659261, "subjectivity": 0.35990300384239804},

The flower kids, also called sweepers, stand out not only for their matching lavender outfits \u2014 color coordinated with the rink\u2019s purple Zambonis \u2014 but also for their quickness and skill navigating the ice. During competitions, the sweepers sit in a group at the edge of the rink, clapping to the music and cheering the athletes.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/sports/olympics/russia-flag-doping.html", "text": "What the organization needs is a tangible plan that could once and for all take antidoping responsibilities away from nations like Russia \u2014 but not only Russia \u2014 that in so many cases have shown a predisposition toward looking the other way on doping, especially when it comes to their own athletes. It needs to create an independent worldwide antidoping task force, with enough financing behind it to make it work.\n\nThe I.O.C. will have to demand that all national Olympic committees and sports federations pitch in, but it needs to reach deeper into its own pockets, too. NBC Universal has committed nearly $8 billion for the media rights for the Games from 2021 through 2032. That\u2019s a lot of money for the I.O.C. to throw around, and right now seems like the right time to throw a lot more of it at antidoping.\n\nAhead of these Winter Games, the I.O.C. talked a big talk to clean up Olympic sports, yet allowed Russia to send one of the largest contingents to these Games, and then approved a \u201cneutral\u201d uniform with the word \u201cRussia\u201d on it.\n\nSo what\u2019s the sense in letting the I.O.C. pretend to be a hard-liner on doping now that the Games are almost done by keeping the Russian flag out of the closing ceremony? The fact that it\u2019s even considering reinstatement, or the laughable partial reinstatement options, shows it still isn\u2019t serious about punishing nations that cheat to win.\n\nRussians won 13 medals through the first 13 days of the Games. None were gold, though that is likely to change when the women\u2019s figure skating is decided Friday morning here. But the Russians were awarded four silvers and nine bronzes, and that\u2019s still something.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut you can\u2019t help but wonder, given Russia\u2019s history, if some of the athletes who finished behind them were robbed again. We know at least two Norwegians who\u2019ve already had their medal moment stolen.\n\nThey blame Alexander Krushelnytsky, a Russian curler. When Krushelnytsky, a bronze medalist in mixed doubles curling, tested positive here for the banned drug meldonium, he at first denied taking the drug. Russian officials claimed sabotage, an unoriginal excuse. Elite athletes here keep close tabs on what they eat and drink, and they don\u2019t leave their water bottles just anywhere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think having a Russian that has tested positive is not a good thing,\u201d said Angela Ruggiero, the chairwoman of the I.O.C.\u2019s athletes\u2019 commission and a four-time Olympian in hockey. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want any athletes testing positive, but in this particular situation, where they\u2019re under a microscope, it does raise questions.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Krushelnytsky stopped fighting his case and abandoned his appeal. He and his teammate will lose their bronze medals, dropping Russia to just 12 medals won here. And while the Norwegians who finished fourth will get those bronzes, they said this week that they still felt \u201crobbed of their moment of glory.\u201d\n\nSo after a positive drug test, why is the I.O.C. even debating whether Russia should march under its flag on Sunday? Sam Edney, a Canadian luger, said the Russian curler\u2019s doping positive should guarantee that the Russian flag never waves inside the stadium.

While Russia has denied any such scheme, Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims were independently verified and led to the ban on Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring the course of filming, Mr. Fogel changed the location of his production office four times, used burner phones to thwart surveillance attempts, edited the film on hard drives rather than a hackable server, and moved Dr. Rodchenkov to four different safe houses. As Dr. Rodchenkov prepared to go public with what he knew, two of his fellow Russian antidoping officials died unexpectedly within less than two weeks of each other.\n\nIn an email, James Walden, Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s lawyer, said his client was regularly being moved to undisclosed locations because of death threats, and Mr. Fogel said he hadn\u2019t seen him in a year.\n\n\u201cI worry about him, and I know that all of us who worked so hard to protect him worry,\u201d Mr. Fogel said.\n\nRussia\u2019s campaign against its former prized chemist continues. In recent months, the government said it would press for Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s extradition (though Russia has no such agreement with the United States), a top Russian Olympic official said he ought to be shot, and Mr. Putin described the whistle-blower as an idiot under American control. A defamation lawsuit was also filed against Dr. Rodchenkov this week, backed by Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the Russian oligarch who owns the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nAndrew Weiss, a Russia expert in the Clinton White House who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that smear campaigns, buttressed by social media attacks, have become part of the standard operating procedure deployed by Russia against perceived enemies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Cordesman, a national security analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe White Helmets group \u201cdoes serve in opposition areas and its work inherently benefits the forces that Russia opposes,\u201d Mr. Cordesman wrote in an email.\n\nAllegations against the White Helmets have been increasing, with the Russian news site RT accusing the group of having terrorist affiliations and plotting a chemical weapons \u201cprovocation.\u201d Such claims have been discredited by Middle East experts, among them Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, who said accusations that the White Helmets were linked to ISIS or Al Qaeda were \u201cpatently absurd\u201d and \u201cpuerile.\u201d\n\n\u201cRT-led disinformation campaigns on matters like this operate on another level to reality,\u201d Mr. Lister wrote in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s only one motivation here: to justify the indiscriminate bombing campaigns that have come to exemplify Russia and the Syrian regime\u2019s day-to-day war.\u201d\n\nMr. Fayyad said he had been repeatedly trolled on social media sites. After the film was shown in Davos, Switzerland, one of Google\u2019s top articles about the screening was a hit piece on the Russian news site Sputnik, according to a screenshot taken by his team. It might be a stretch to assume that academy voters are paying much mind to Russian news sites, but Mr. Fayyad believes that detractors, in their fervor to discredit the White Helmets, are also aiming to derail his film\u2019s Oscar chances, something he is trying to offset by sounding the alarm.\n\nMr. Fayyad is from the countryside outside Aleppo and, in March 2011, was working on another film, about the 1982 massacre in the city of Hama, when Syria\u2019s civil uprising began. Mr. Fayyad was arrested \u2014 he was accused of spreading false news, he said \u2014 imprisoned and tortured. (His nails were ripped out, he was shackled and hung by his hands from a ceiling, and sensitive parts of his body were shocked with electricity, he said.)\n\nFor all the horrors he suffered, Mr. Fayyad was struck by his fellow prisoners\u2019 resistance and determination to survive, and how they buoyed each other by singing songs in the lowest of voices. Nearly a year later, he emerged wanting to make a film that showed how people endured in the teeth of war, and clung to the tiniest glimmers of solace and hope.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell the story of the White Helmets; I wanted to tell the story about these people as citizens of their society,\u201d Mr. Fayyad said. But accompanying the men on their gruesome rescue missions took a harrowing toll. \u201cIt kills something inside you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a film about our nightmare.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile the film\u2019s producer and assistant director were recently denied visas to attend the Academy Awards, Mr. Fayyad could take comfort in the fact that the White Helmets have already received the endorsement of the academy; last year, a short documentary about the group landed an Oscar. It would be something if another film about the White Helmets won, though the lighthearted \u201cFaces Places\u201d is currently the favorite. In the end, we will probably never know whether Russians will manage to sway academy voters.

And now Medvedeva\u2019s time may have gone before it arrived.\n\nShe could still win gold on Friday, skating as Tolstoy\u2019s tragic Anna Karenina. She sits in second place, only 1.3 points behind her training partner in Moscow, the 15-year-old Alina Zagitova. It would be premature to count Medvedeva out. But there is something awakening in Zagitova. She defeated Medvedeva last month at the European championships. In Wednesday\u2019s short program, Medvedeva set a world record for points. Ten minutes later, Zagitova broke it.\n\nStill, Medvedeva will be a central figure at these Games, gold medal or not.\n\nIt was Medvedeva who helped to argue \u2014 successfully \u2014 in December before the International Olympic Committee that not all Russian athletes should be banned from these Games because of systematic doping orchestrated at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe laughs often and speaks comfortably with reporters in both Russian and English.

While it was Giacometti who conceived the whimsical bronze pieces dripping with tiny flora and fauna, it was Anthonioz who did most of the fabrication; his spidery chairs, benches and oversize resin chandeliers form a conceptual bridge between the building\u2019s 17th-century architecture and Picasso\u2019s slashing Modernism. \u201cI am proud of what we did, of course,\u201d Anthonioz says, recalling the generosity of the older artist, whom he had first met when he was 13 through his well-connected father. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be defined by that.\u201d\n\nThese days, Anthonioz \u2014 who mostly sculpts in wood and plaster that is often cast in bronze \u2014 is known for his large-scale, abstract public statuary and custom-made lighting and functional objects for architects including Joseph Dirand, the fashion designer Tomas Maier and the interiors brand Ralph Pucci, for which he makes a line of bronze torchieres. Since 1979, he has kept his main studio in Passage Saint Bernard, a two-block-long cobblestone street not far from the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, Afi Nayo, a Togolese mixed-media artist.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he moved in, the alley had been home to generations of the city\u2019s furniture-makers, restorers and ebonizers. For the first 15 years, he occupied the second floor of No. 17, a magnificent 18th-century wooden building that was torn down to make way for an apartment complex in the mid-1990s, part of a short-lived attempt by Paris officials to erect new housing.

For most of history, it did only what it had to: provide a home when you were away from yours. Then, in the last century, a hotel became a place meant not just for shelter, but a destination; a place that embraced its not-homeness by being better than your home could ever be.\n\nNow, a new project is defining the hotel anew. In September, 700,000 Heures will become the world\u2019s first nomadic hotel. The idea is that a hotel is not an actual structure, but a state of mind, a series of experiences, a respite from your life. Every six months, 700,000 Heures (the approximate length of an average human life in the developed world) will change locations, occupying different buildings in different places \u2014 sometimes an existing building will be reimagined or refit for the hotel\u2019s needs; other times, it might even be built from scratch. First up will be a four-room, 19th-century stone palazzo in Gagliano del Capo, a small town in Salento, Italy, known for its wild beaches and groves of knotted olive trees. Then, after this trial run, the palazzo will be returned to its owner, and 700,000 Heures will move to northwestern Cambodia, where guests will stay in a series of locations, among them an ancient Buddhist temple. Most of the structures the company inhabits will be small \u2014 likely no more than eight rooms in any one location \u2014 and first priority will be given to its several hundred members, who\u2019ll pay an annual 500 euro fee and will be able to opt into destinations as they please. (Those wanting to join can apply through one of 700,000 Heures\u2019 50 approved travel agents.) The company is the invention of a French hotelier named Thierry Teyssier, who over the years has operated small, exquisite hotels in Morocco, Portugal and Brazil. \u201cI want to be able to spend real time with my guests,\u201d he says. \u201c700,000 Heures is personal. It\u2019s the hotel I would like to find, if I were the traveler.\u201d\n\nAlthough 700,000 Heures will be the first impermanent hotel, it finds its origins in a dining and hospitality culture that has become ever more attracted to the ephemeral, the rootless and the rare. The past decade or so has seen a proliferation of pop-up restaurants and shops \u2014 Teyssier made his own contribution to this trend in the form of a pop-up hotel in Paraty, in southern Brazil, which operated for six months in 2014 before shutting down. At the same time, there\u2019s been an embrace of what might be called subscription-based hospitality: In London, there\u2019s Carousel, a restaurant with a constantly rotating series of guest chefs and a set menu each night for which tickets must be purchased in advance, or the membership-based Soho House, which now has 18 locations worldwide. Teyssier\u2019s company speaks to a certain kind of traveler\u2019s desire for both novelty and consistency \u2014 the location might be different, but the mood must always feel familiar.\n\nOne of the ways 700,000 Heures plans to achieve this is through Teyssier\u2019s presence; indeed, he\u2019ll act less as hotelier and more as impresario, remaining on-site through each of the hotel\u2019s incarnations, and organizing excursions and events for all of the guests. In Salento, this might mean a fishing-boat ride through hidden coves along the Adriatic, or a sunset picnic at Santa Maria di Leuca, a little-known Roman sanctuary. In Cambodia, destinations will include Tonle Sap Lake, a biosphere reserve with a floating village of wooden houses, or the French colonial city of Battambang, where travelers can train with acrobats at the renowned Phare Circus. The goal, Teyssier says, is for the guest to feel like an actor in a theatrical production: the natural outgrowth of an age in which vacations are presented like biopics on social media. And, as for an actor, 700,000 Heures also provides props: Along with the physical spaces, Teyssier has created a series of leather trunks \u2014 each filled with objects to create a different mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, from cocktail bar to art studio \u2014 that will appear at all of the hotels and will provide an aesthetic through line. The hotel will also present members with a mock passport, which will be stamped after each trip. \u201cSome people make sculpture,\u201d Teyssier says. \u201cI\u2019m in the business of creating memories.\u201d \u2014 GISELA WILLIAMS\n\nImage \u201cCaa Caa\u201d (2017). Credit Bathmat on canvas/photo By Adam Schreiber\n\nHigh-Low\n\nThe artist Andy Coolquitt is always searching through Austin, Tex.\u2019s thrift stores and abandoned lots for eye-catching flotsam, which he then fashions into haute Minimalist sculptures: lamps made of odd loops of metal pipe, or a series of Snuggies, which, stretched across a frame, resemble Blinky Palermo\u2019s fuzzy color fields, but with sleeves. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of focus on craft, technique or finish fetish,\u201d says the 53-year-old artist, who studied at U.C.L.A. and the University of Texas at Austin. Rather, his aim is to poke fun at the imposed distinction between art and life by highlighting an object\u2019s strange journey from useful tool to used-up trash to a thing of value defined by uselessness (art). He even lives inside his longest-running piece \u2014 a multi-building compound in the center of town that, over the course of two decades, he\u2019s filled with work and fellow artists. \u201cInstead of making art about domesticity, I figured I\u2019d just make a house,\u201d he says.\n\nAt an installation opening this spring at the Hotel Indigo in Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 a satellite space of the Santa Barbara Museum of Contemporary Art \u2014 visitors, too, can live among Coolquitt\u2019s work, about 25 pieces of which will fill the building\u2019s lobby and hallways. Coolquitt, who\u2019s shown everywhere from New York\u2019s Marianne Boesky Gallery to the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, believes a show should reflect its context. In this non-gallery setting, he saw an opportunity to be playful \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not really into confronting people with difficult ideas while they\u2019re on vacation,\u201d he says. That means synthetic pink wigs draped over lamps, a canvas affixed with bathrobe belts arrayed in clean vertical stripes and rectilinear wall hangings made of colorful bathmats (shown above) \u2014 the rare study in geometric abstraction where the polygons are plush. \u2014 SAM DEAN\n\nRunway Report: Logos a Go-Go\n\nImage Credit Illustrations by Jean-Michel Tixier\n\nFrom left: Comme des Garc\u0327ons Shirt Boys, $275, (212) 604-9200.

In 2016, after stints at the French Laundry and Northcote, his father\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant in Lancashire, England, the now-30-year-old British chef was diagnosed with Lyme disease and forced to take a break from his work. After noticing that heavy, processed foods exacerbated his symptoms, he started experimenting with a vegan diet. \u201cNow I treat myself through food and natural remedies alone; I don\u2019t take any pain medication,\u201d he says. With Plates, a plant-based restaurant he\u2019s opening with his sister Keeley in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood, he\u2019ll share his findings with an increasingly wellness-minded public, though this is hardly another juice-and-avocado-toast joint. Haworth\u2019s complex, cerebral dishes are grounded in classic techniques: In one, beetroot is salt-baked like beef with juniper and thyme, and then topped with fermented berries, avocado and fennel pollen from the nearby Hackney Marshes. Other standouts include a radicchio salad flavored with agave and wild blackberry vinegar (shown above) and a wild mushroom broth with immune-boosting shiitake, kombu and baked celeriac. \u201cIt can take weeks to replicate the richness of a sauce without butter, or to balance acidity without sugar,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be intelligent with vegetables.\u201d \u2014 AIMEE FARRELL\n\nSign up for the Open Thread Newsletter A look from across the New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

Since the 1800s, doctors had been prescribing hydrotherapy, and health resorts were being established across the continent. As the historian David Clay Large has written, \u201cthe grand spas in their heyday amounted to their world\u2019s equivalent of today\u2019s golf and tennis resorts, conference centers, business retreats, political summits, fashion shows, theme parks and sexual hideaways \u2014 all rolled into one.\u201d\n\nPeople afflicted with everything from gout to arthritis came to \u201ctake the waters\u201d at spa towns across Europe, but unlike the sanatoriums with which they were concurrent, their visitors were not always ill. Instead they came to socialize, attend cultural events and negotiate political treaties. The towns themselves \u2014 Aix-les-Bains and Vichy in France; Bath and Buxton in England; Aachen and Baden-Baden in Germany \u2014 built above the rubble of thermal baths established by Roman conquerors centuries earlier, were plotted to maximize what was known as a \u201ctherapeutic landscape,\u201d a kind of aestheticized social engineering that promoted strolling and alfresco mingling. The architectural style of the bathhouses themselves was formal and atavistic, with marble walls, high arches, domed ceilings and mosaic floors. Well-maintained, infrastructurally sophisticated and aggressively promoted, these grand spa complexes were some of the earliest examples of modern tourist destinations.\n\nPhoto\n\nYEARS BEFORE THE concept of a politically and culturally unified Europe gained traction, withdrawing from life (if even for a week) was a recurring feature of Continental existence. Spa culture \u2014 defined by its intentional architecture, geographical remove and somnambulistic ambience \u2014 was experienced in direct opposition to the rapid-paced, sick-making atmosphere of industrialized Europe. Unlike in America, where tuberculosis sanatoriums functioned more like hospitals than lifestyle colonies, the bosky outreaches of central Europe served as a sort of mystical destination where people from kingdoms near and far could live temporarily apart from reality \u2014 intermingling, arguing, falling in love \u2014 even as the security and sovereignty of the world around them remained imperiled. It\u2019s unsurprising that a microcosm containing different types of people with little to do but reflect and cathect provided fiction writers with a generative setting, one which everyone from George Eliot to Henry James to Guy de Maupassant took advantage of.\n\nIndeed, with enough selective reading it can seem as though every 19th-century writer of note spent at least a little time at a spa town. Turgenev and Goethe took the waters at Karlovy Vary in western Bohemia; Dickens and Tennyson visited Yorkshire\u2019s Harrogate. The Black Forest-surrounded Baden-Baden was perhaps the most popular, especially among the Russians: Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky both visited; Chekhov died 90 miles south of there in Badenweiler in 1904 after an injection of camphor, a sip of champagne and a few weeks of writing letters to his sister in which he described his diet (boiled mutton, strawberry tea and \u201cenormous quantities\u201d of butter) and complained about German women\u2019s poor taste in clothing. His body was brought home in a refrigerator car meant for oysters. Mark Twain visited the Bohemian spa town of Marianske Lazne (often referred to by its German name, Marienbad) in 1892 and sarcastically cataloged a spa regimen for a patient suffering from gout that involved rising at 5:30 a.m., drinking \u201cdreadful\u201d water, tramping in the hills, wallowing in the mud and eating as much as possible \u201cso long as he is careful and eats only such things as he doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nMy daily routine in Marianske Lazne wasn\u2019t actually so different. It began with a walk through the small, central part of the village, whose springs have been touted as curative for centuries and which was visited by an almost-laughable list of luminaries that included state heads (Czar Nicholas II, Emperor Franz Josef I), intellectuals (Freud, Edison, Kafka, Nietzsche, Kipling) and composers (Mahler, Wagner, Chopin, Strauss). The town is made up of pale neo-Classical buildings edged with verdigrised turrets and elaborate spires. The public gardens are tidy and politely pretty. Czech couples stroll along camel-colored crushed-granite paths, carrying flattened porcelain spa cups whose handles also serve as straws and which they fill at public fountains. Large groups of Germans walk briskly in excessive hiking gear, stopping at outdoor cafes where they order steins of pilsner and read Der Spiegel. The Russians wear their bathrobes everywhere and keep to the gilded hotel lobbies, where they play chess with one another as mole-removal videos loop on overhead TVs. At the grand hotels, whose convoluted floor plans also house spas, sublimated weight loss strategies are nonexistent, as are the high-tech instruments and the suggestions of pan-Asian wellness (gongs, bamboo) that one sees everywhere in America. In the absence of vanity and hard science and globalism, a sort of generic and primal prewar Europeanness persists, as unsettling as it is soothing.\n\nAnd as Twain himself reported, the meals were indeed curious and the prescriptions harebrained. At the Danubius Health Spa Resort Centralni Lazne, treatments are administered in tiled, cobweb-laced rooms. My first was a \u201cmineral bath with natural CO2\u201d for which I was led into a stainless-steel bathtub by a caustic attendant and told to ignore a half-submerged rusty wire. The water, just above lukewarm and smelling of sulfur, fizzed lightly. I had the impression of floating in rapidly cooling club soda. The attendant came back in, unannounced, wrapped me in a blanket, and discouraged me from trying to remove an arm so I could read my book. Benefits are said to include \u201cimproved blood circulation, heart and kidney activity as well as reduced stress and anxiety.\u201d Later, I dawdled in a Kneipp foot bath, named for a Bavarian priest who advised walking without shoes through morning dew, and the following day spent a disturbing 30 minutes in a tiled alcove, while dry oxygen was delivered into my nostrils via a latex tube. Each evening, a heavy dinner was served (often including hot sauerkraut, beef tongue in cream sauce, pickled herring and, for dessert, whole peeled kiwis), followed by flutes of Bohemian sparkling wine, which one could sip while classical musicians performed.\n\nPhoto\n\nTHE SANATORIUMS OF Europe are now closed, and the spa towns where acute and imagined maladies alike were elevated to a glamorous lifestyle are today visited almost exclusively by the elderly. But medically informed repose \u2014 experienced far and away from the world, quietly and alongside others as sick (or not) as oneself \u2014 can still be had. In Vals, Switzerland, not 70 miles from Davos (once studded with about 40 sanatoriums), thermal waters run through the valley\u2019s granite walls. A beautiful if deliberately sterile-feeling spa hotel sits just above the small village and beckons visitors from all over the world, who come to bathe in silence and eat overpriced pear bread while gazing at verdant pastures. Those seeking wellness today do not want outdoor concerts or lectures or chitchat. They want to be by themselves, ideally in a photogenic location with poor cellphone service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe walls of the Peter Zumthor-designed spa, opened in 1996 under the name Therme Vals and now part of the 7132 Hotel, are made from 60,000 one-meter-long slabs of locally quarried quartzite; the concrete roof is covered with grass. Giant windows overlooking gray mountains somehow don\u2019t do much to brighten what is otherwise a dark and labyrinthine experience. \u201cMoving around this space means making discoveries,\u201d Zumthor has said. \u201cYou are walking as if in the woods. Everyone there is looking for a path of their own.\u201d\n\nI often wondered if I would ever find mine. I spent as much time soaking in various baths as I did wandering around through the mist between them. It was easy to appreciate the solemn beauty of Vals\u2019s imposing modern design, which was clearly plotted with great intention and intellect, while still feeling unpleasant panic each time you rounded a corner only to see a dim hallway coaxing you who knows where. Before the property owner stepped in and insisted otherwise, Zumthor was adamant that his spa have no clocks inside. He wanted bathers to feel not just weightless in the water but timeless too. The twin clocks that were installed are nearly hidden (I only found out about them weeks after I had come home) and the cavernous space succeeds in making the minutes melt into hours.\n\nIn daily life, it\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t know the time down to the minute, and with the tap of a single skeuomorphic button I can find out where I am anywhere in the world, as well as whatever terrible things are happening halfway around it. In previous centuries, those suffering from ailments and ennui could travel through forests and up glaciers, by train and horse, to drink and dip in therapeutic waters. They endured unthinkable hassle to gain access to legendary liquids and dubious expertise. Today, we know better. Sunlight doesn\u2019t kill germs and physical maladies aren\u2019t cured by carbonated water. The best we can hope for is the kind of psychological balm that comes from temporarily removing oneself from the responsibilities of daily life, which lately seem to involve the helpless monitoring of catastrophes we can do nothing about. To travel from one empire in decline to countries whose golden eras were over 100 years in the past is to accept \u2014 and if possible, enjoy \u2014 the undeniable fact that disorientation can be its own kind of decadence.", "keywords": ["europes", "search", "spa", "walls", "town", "towns", "europe", "sanatoriums", "lost", "world", "water", "visited", "waters"], "polarity": 0.08353356276018148, "subjectivity": 0.5007576795706292},

While it was Giacometti who conceived the whimsical bronze pieces dripping with tiny flora and fauna, it was Anthonioz who did most of the fabrication; his spidery chairs, benches and oversize resin chandeliers form a conceptual bridge between the building\u2019s 17th-century architecture and Picasso\u2019s slashing Modernism. \u201cI am proud of what we did, of course,\u201d Anthonioz says, recalling the generosity of the older artist, whom he had first met when he was 13 through his well-connected father. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be defined by that.\u201d\n\nThese days, Anthonioz \u2014 who mostly sculpts in wood and plaster that is often cast in bronze \u2014 is known for his large-scale, abstract public statuary and custom-made lighting and functional objects for architects including Joseph Dirand, the fashion designer Tomas Maier and the interiors brand Ralph Pucci, for which he makes a line of bronze torchieres. Since 1979, he has kept his main studio in Passage Saint Bernard, a two-block-long cobblestone street not far from the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, Afi Nayo, a Togolese mixed-media artist.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he moved in, the alley had been home to generations of the city\u2019s furniture-makers, restorers and ebonizers. For the first 15 years, he occupied the second floor of No. 17, a magnificent 18th-century wooden building that was torn down to make way for an apartment complex in the mid-1990s, part of a short-lived attempt by Paris officials to erect new housing. But Anthonioz, enamored of the neighborhood\u2019s gritty charm \u2014 he compares it to Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, back before the boutiques descended in the early aughts \u2014 remained, moving a few doors down to the 1,600-square-foot ground floor of another 18th-century building, one accessible through an aged oak door. \u201cIf there is no romance in the environment,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to make good things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike the studios of many contemporary artists, which are often minimalist affairs, defiantly ahistorical, his is redolent of the past. The front is an art-book-filled office-cum-salon, with walls hung with antique mirrors and vintage photos, including one of Charles Baudelaire, his lodestar; the back is a workshop crowded with stone arms and torsos, piled alongside pieces of old chandeliers used to construct limited-edition light fixtures for spaces like Loulou, the Dirand-designed restaurant in Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Frosted with fine plaster dust, the space itself seems sepia-toned, like a Eug\u00e8ne Atget photograph.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Anthonioz and Giacometti shared the belief that there should be no dividing line between decoration and fine art, their aesthetics diverged radically. Giacometti was obsessed with figuration and the natural world \u2014 he spent hours studying birds in the city\u2019s Jardin des Plantes, where Henri Rousseau had once found inspiration \u2014 but Anthonioz has always been driven by abstraction. Giacometti was a master of affixing tiny animals and curling leaves to the bronze framework of his designs, lending them a fey quality; Anthonioz eschews ornament, preferring sleek minimalist shapes. \u201cPeople always speak of me in the same breath as Diego, but I think of Carlo Scarpa, David Smith or even the Bauhaus,\u201d he says.\n\nIndeed, his sculptures have become increasingly monumental in recent years \u2014 the eight-foot-tall \u201cLa M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e,\u201d a cast-bronze totem, was installed in Pratt Institute\u2019s Brooklyn sculpture garden in 2016 \u2014 so he now works part-time in a lofty second studio in Ivry-sur-Seine, a southeastern suburb. He is also restoring an 18th-century farmhouse in the south, near Aix-en-Provence, where he plans to make work in his later years, in a barn he\u2019s converting into a studio. There, he hopes his five grown children will bring their own kids to run in the fields. \u201cMy work has gotten more abstract, maybe even more modern, as I\u2019ve gotten older,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dog on a leash \u2014 not in what I create, and not in how I live my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["18thcentury", "parisian", "charles", "sculptors", "works", "bronze", "studio", "work", "wonders", "anthonioz", "inside", "giacometti", "tiny", "world", "sculptor"], "polarity": 0.1389933820968304, "subjectivity": 0.38793414439966156},

For most of history, it did only what it had to: provide a home when you were away from yours. Then, in the last century, a hotel became a place meant not just for shelter, but a destination; a place that embraced its not-homeness by being better than your home could ever be.\n\nNow, a new project is defining the hotel anew. In September, 700,000 Heures will become the world\u2019s first nomadic hotel. The idea is that a hotel is not an actual structure, but a state of mind, a series of experiences, a respite from your life. Every six months, 700,000 Heures (the approximate length of an average human life in the developed world) will change locations, occupying different buildings in different places \u2014 sometimes an existing building will be reimagined or refit for the hotel\u2019s needs; other times, it might even be built from scratch. First up will be a four-room, 19th-century stone palazzo in Gagliano del Capo, a small town in Salento, Italy, known for its wild beaches and groves of knotted olive trees. Then, after this trial run, the palazzo will be returned to its owner, and 700,000 Heures will move to northwestern Cambodia, where guests will stay in a series of locations, among them an ancient Buddhist temple. Most of the structures the company inhabits will be small \u2014 likely no more than eight rooms in any one location \u2014 and first priority will be given to its several hundred members, who\u2019ll pay an annual 500 euro fee and will be able to opt into destinations as they please. (Those wanting to join can apply through one of 700,000 Heures\u2019 50 approved travel agents.) The company is the invention of a French hotelier named Thierry Teyssier, who over the years has operated small, exquisite hotels in Morocco, Portugal and Brazil. \u201cI want to be able to spend real time with my guests,\u201d he says. \u201c700,000 Heures is personal. It\u2019s the hotel I would like to find, if I were the traveler.\u201d\n\nAlthough 700,000 Heures will be the first impermanent hotel, it finds its origins in a dining and hospitality culture that has become ever more attracted to the ephemeral, the rootless and the rare. The past decade or so has seen a proliferation of pop-up restaurants and shops \u2014 Teyssier made his own contribution to this trend in the form of a pop-up hotel in Paraty, in southern Brazil, which operated for six months in 2014 before shutting down. At the same time, there\u2019s been an embrace of what might be called subscription-based hospitality: In London, there\u2019s Carousel, a restaurant with a constantly rotating series of guest chefs and a set menu each night for which tickets must be purchased in advance, or the membership-based Soho House, which now has 18 locations worldwide. Teyssier\u2019s company speaks to a certain kind of traveler\u2019s desire for both novelty and consistency \u2014 the location might be different, but the mood must always feel familiar.\n\nOne of the ways 700,000 Heures plans to achieve this is through Teyssier\u2019s presence; indeed, he\u2019ll act less as hotelier and more as impresario, remaining on-site through each of the hotel\u2019s incarnations, and organizing excursions and events for all of the guests. In Salento, this might mean a fishing-boat ride through hidden coves along the Adriatic, or a sunset picnic at Santa Maria di Leuca, a little-known Roman sanctuary. In Cambodia, destinations will include Tonle Sap Lake, a biosphere reserve with a floating village of wooden houses, or the French colonial city of Battambang, where travelers can train with acrobats at the renowned Phare Circus. The goal, Teyssier says, is for the guest to feel like an actor in a theatrical production: the natural outgrowth of an age in which vacations are presented like biopics on social media. And, as for an actor, 700,000 Heures also provides props: Along with the physical spaces, Teyssier has created a series of leather trunks \u2014 each filled with objects to create a different mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, from cocktail bar to art studio \u2014 that will appear at all of the hotels and will provide an aesthetic through line. The hotel will also present members with a mock passport, which will be stamped after each trip. \u201cSome people make sculpture,\u201d Teyssier says. \u201cI\u2019m in the business of creating memories.\u201d \u2014 GISELA WILLIAMS\n\nImage \u201cCaa Caa\u201d (2017). Credit Bathmat on canvas/photo By Adam Schreiber\n\nHigh-Low\n\nThe artist Andy Coolquitt is always searching through Austin, Tex.\u2019s thrift stores and abandoned lots for eye-catching flotsam, which he then fashions into haute Minimalist sculptures: lamps made of odd loops of metal pipe, or a series of Snuggies, which, stretched across a frame, resemble Blinky Palermo\u2019s fuzzy color fields, but with sleeves. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of focus on craft, technique or finish fetish,\u201d says the 53-year-old artist, who studied at U.C.L.A. and the University of Texas at Austin. Rather, his aim is to poke fun at the imposed distinction between art and life by highlighting an object\u2019s strange journey from useful tool to used-up trash to a thing of value defined by uselessness (art). He even lives inside his longest-running piece \u2014 a multi-building compound in the center of town that, over the course of two decades, he\u2019s filled with work and fellow artists. \u201cInstead of making art about domesticity, I figured I\u2019d just make a house,\u201d he says.\n\nAt an installation opening this spring at the Hotel Indigo in Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 a satellite space of the Santa Barbara Museum of Contemporary Art \u2014 visitors, too, can live among Coolquitt\u2019s work, about 25 pieces of which will fill the building\u2019s lobby and hallways. Coolquitt, who\u2019s shown everywhere from New York\u2019s Marianne Boesky Gallery to the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, believes a show should reflect its context. In this non-gallery setting, he saw an opportunity to be playful \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not really into confronting people with difficult ideas while they\u2019re on vacation,\u201d he says. That means synthetic pink wigs draped over lamps, a canvas affixed with bathrobe belts arrayed in clean vertical stripes and rectilinear wall hangings made of colorful bathmats (shown above) \u2014 the rare study in geometric abstraction where the polygons are plush. \u2014 SAM DEAN\n\nRunway Report: Logos a Go-Go\n\nImage Credit Illustrations by Jean-Michel Tixier\n\nFrom left: Comme des Garc\u0327ons Shirt Boys, $275, (212) 604-9200.

In 2016, after stints at the French Laundry and Northcote, his father\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant in Lancashire, England, the now-30-year-old British chef was diagnosed with Lyme disease and forced to take a break from his work. After noticing that heavy, processed foods exacerbated his symptoms, he started experimenting with a vegan diet. \u201cNow I treat myself through food and natural remedies alone; I don\u2019t take any pain medication,\u201d he says. With Plates, a plant-based restaurant he\u2019s opening with his sister Keeley in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood, he\u2019ll share his findings with an increasingly wellness-minded public, though this is hardly another juice-and-avocado-toast joint. Haworth\u2019s complex, cerebral dishes are grounded in classic techniques: In one, beetroot is salt-baked like beef with juniper and thyme, and then topped with fermented berries, avocado and fennel pollen from the nearby Hackney Marshes. Other standouts include a radicchio salad flavored with agave and wild blackberry vinegar (shown above) and a wild mushroom broth with immune-boosting shiitake, kombu and baked celeriac. \u201cIt can take weeks to replicate the richness of a sauce without butter, or to balance acidity without sugar,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be intelligent with vegetables.\u201d \u2014 AIMEE FARRELL\n\nSign up for the Open Thread Newsletter A look from across the New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

{"title": "\n                    In Search of Lost Time in Europe\u2019s Sanatoriums                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/t-magazine/sanatorium-europe-history.html", "text": "Also connected to that culture was a parallel institution that flourished in Europe around the turn of the century: the thermal spa. Since the 1800s, doctors had been prescribing hydrotherapy, and health resorts were being established across the continent. As the historian David Clay Large has written, \u201cthe grand spas in their heyday amounted to their world\u2019s equivalent of today\u2019s golf and tennis resorts, conference centers, business retreats, political summits, fashion shows, theme parks and sexual hideaways \u2014 all rolled into one.\u201d\n\nPeople afflicted with everything from gout to arthritis came to \u201ctake the waters\u201d at spa towns across Europe, but unlike the sanatoriums with which they were concurrent, their visitors were not always ill. Instead they came to socialize, attend cultural events and negotiate political treaties. The towns themselves \u2014 Aix-les-Bains and Vichy in France; Bath and Buxton in England; Aachen and Baden-Baden in Germany \u2014 built above the rubble of thermal baths established by Roman conquerors centuries earlier, were plotted to maximize what was known as a \u201ctherapeutic landscape,\u201d a kind of aestheticized social engineering that promoted strolling and alfresco mingling. The architectural style of the bathhouses themselves was formal and atavistic, with marble walls, high arches, domed ceilings and mosaic floors. Well-maintained, infrastructurally sophisticated and aggressively promoted, these grand spa complexes were some of the earliest examples of modern tourist destinations.\n\nPhoto\n\nYEARS BEFORE THE concept of a politically and culturally unified Europe gained traction, withdrawing from life (if even for a week) was a recurring feature of Continental existence. Spa culture \u2014 defined by its intentional architecture, geographical remove and somnambulistic ambience \u2014 was experienced in direct opposition to the rapid-paced, sick-making atmosphere of industrialized Europe. Unlike in America, where tuberculosis sanatoriums functioned more like hospitals than lifestyle colonies, the bosky outreaches of central Europe served as a sort of mystical destination where people from kingdoms near and far could live temporarily apart from reality \u2014 intermingling, arguing, falling in love \u2014 even as the security and sovereignty of the world around them remained imperiled. It\u2019s unsurprising that a microcosm containing different types of people with little to do but reflect and cathect provided fiction writers with a generative setting, one which everyone from George Eliot to Henry James to Guy de Maupassant took advantage of.\n\nIndeed, with enough selective reading it can seem as though every 19th-century writer of note spent at least a little time at a spa town. Turgenev and Goethe took the waters at Karlovy Vary in western Bohemia; Dickens and Tennyson visited Yorkshire\u2019s Harrogate. The Black Forest-surrounded Baden-Baden was perhaps the most popular, especially among the Russians: Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky both visited; Chekhov died 90 miles south of there in Badenweiler in 1904 after an injection of camphor, a sip of champagne and a few weeks of writing letters to his sister in which he described his diet (boiled mutton, strawberry tea and \u201cenormous quantities\u201d of butter) and complained about German women\u2019s poor taste in clothing. His body was brought home in a refrigerator car meant for oysters. Mark Twain visited the Bohemian spa town of Marianske Lazne (often referred to by its German name, Marienbad) in 1892 and sarcastically cataloged a spa regimen for a patient suffering from gout that involved rising at 5:30 a.m., drinking \u201cdreadful\u201d water, tramping in the hills, wallowing in the mud and eating as much as possible \u201cso long as he is careful and eats only such things as he doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nMy daily routine in Marianske Lazne wasn\u2019t actually so different. It began with a walk through the small, central part of the village, whose springs have been touted as curative for centuries and which was visited by an almost-laughable list of luminaries that included state heads (Czar Nicholas II, Emperor Franz Josef I), intellectuals (Freud, Edison, Kafka, Nietzsche, Kipling) and composers (Mahler, Wagner, Chopin, Strauss). The town is made up of pale neo-Classical buildings edged with verdigrised turrets and elaborate spires. The public gardens are tidy and politely pretty. Czech couples stroll along camel-colored crushed-granite paths, carrying flattened porcelain spa cups whose handles also serve as straws and which they fill at public fountains. Large groups of Germans walk briskly in excessive hiking gear, stopping at outdoor cafes where they order steins of pilsner and read Der Spiegel. The Russians wear their bathrobes everywhere and keep to the gilded hotel lobbies, where they play chess with one another as mole-removal videos loop on overhead TVs. At the grand hotels, whose convoluted floor plans also house spas, sublimated weight loss strategies are nonexistent, as are the high-tech instruments and the suggestions of pan-Asian wellness (gongs, bamboo) that one sees everywhere in America. In the absence of vanity and hard science and globalism, a sort of generic and primal prewar Europeanness persists, as unsettling as it is soothing.\n\nAnd as Twain himself reported, the meals were indeed curious and the prescriptions harebrained. At the Danubius Health Spa Resort Centralni Lazne, treatments are administered in tiled, cobweb-laced rooms. My first was a \u201cmineral bath with natural CO2\u201d for which I was led into a stainless-steel bathtub by a caustic attendant and told to ignore a half-submerged rusty wire. The water, just above lukewarm and smelling of sulfur, fizzed lightly. I had the impression of floating in rapidly cooling club soda. The attendant came back in, unannounced, wrapped me in a blanket, and discouraged me from trying to remove an arm so I could read my book. Benefits are said to include \u201cimproved blood circulation, heart and kidney activity as well as reduced stress and anxiety.\u201d Later, I dawdled in a Kneipp foot bath, named for a Bavarian priest who advised walking without shoes through morning dew, and the following day spent a disturbing 30 minutes in a tiled alcove, while dry oxygen was delivered into my nostrils via a latex tube. Each evening, a heavy dinner was served (often including hot sauerkraut, beef tongue in cream sauce, pickled herring and, for dessert, whole peeled kiwis), followed by flutes of Bohemian sparkling wine, which one could sip while classical musicians performed.\n\nPhoto\n\nTHE SANATORIUMS OF Europe are now closed, and the spa towns where acute and imagined maladies alike were elevated to a glamorous lifestyle are today visited almost exclusively by the elderly. But medically informed repose \u2014 experienced far and away from the world, quietly and alongside others as sick (or not) as oneself \u2014 can still be had. In Vals, Switzerland, not 70 miles from Davos (once studded with about 40 sanatoriums), thermal waters run through the valley\u2019s granite walls. A beautiful if deliberately sterile-feeling spa hotel sits just above the small village and beckons visitors from all over the world, who come to bathe in silence and eat overpriced pear bread while gazing at verdant pastures. Those seeking wellness today do not want outdoor concerts or lectures or chitchat. They want to be by themselves, ideally in a photogenic location with poor cellphone service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe walls of the Peter Zumthor-designed spa, opened in 1996 under the name Therme Vals and now part of the 7132 Hotel, are made from 60,000 one-meter-long slabs of locally quarried quartzite; the concrete roof is covered with grass. Giant windows overlooking gray mountains somehow don\u2019t do much to brighten what is otherwise a dark and labyrinthine experience. \u201cMoving around this space means making discoveries,\u201d Zumthor has said. \u201cYou are walking as if in the woods. Everyone there is looking for a path of their own.\u201d\n\nI often wondered if I would ever find mine. I spent as much time soaking in various baths as I did wandering around through the mist between them. It was easy to appreciate the solemn beauty of Vals\u2019s imposing modern design, which was clearly plotted with great intention and intellect, while still feeling unpleasant panic each time you rounded a corner only to see a dim hallway coaxing you who knows where. Before the property owner stepped in and insisted otherwise, Zumthor was adamant that his spa have no clocks inside. He wanted bathers to feel not just weightless in the water but timeless too. The twin clocks that were installed are nearly hidden (I only found out about them weeks after I had come home) and the cavernous space succeeds in making the minutes melt into hours.\n\nIn daily life, it\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t know the time down to the minute, and with the tap of a single skeuomorphic button I can find out where I am anywhere in the world, as well as whatever terrible things are happening halfway around it. In previous centuries, those suffering from ailments and ennui could travel through forests and up glaciers, by train and horse, to drink and dip in therapeutic waters. They endured unthinkable hassle to gain access to legendary liquids and dubious expertise. Today, we know better. Sunlight doesn\u2019t kill germs and physical maladies aren\u2019t cured by carbonated water. The best we can hope for is the kind of psychological balm that comes from temporarily removing oneself from the responsibilities of daily life, which lately seem to involve the helpless monitoring of catastrophes we can do nothing about. To travel from one empire in decline to countries whose golden eras were over 100 years in the past is to accept \u2014 and if possible, enjoy \u2014 the undeniable fact that disorientation can be its own kind of decadence.", "keywords": ["europes", "search", "spa", "walls", "town", "towns", "europe", "sanatoriums", "lost", "world", "water", "visited", "waters"], "polarity": 0.08353356276018148, "subjectivity": 0.5007576795706292}
