Or perhaps it was Suzanne Contos, who helped organize the conference in 1971? (It was neither. Ms. Berryman\u2019s age did not seem to match the photo, and Ms. Contos said it was not her.)\n\nThen Dee Allen, the research program officer at the Marine Mammal Commission, saw the photograph on Twitter and contacted some of her mentors.\n\n\u201cI figured it was probably something I could track down pretty easily, and I have an appreciation for the history of the field,\u201d Ms. Allen said. She contacted Don Wilson, the emeritus curator of mammals at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Wilson remembered. He told Ms. Allen that the woman had worked as a museum technician, and her name was Sheila.\n\n\u201cSheila was working at the museum in the Division of Mammals when I first started there in September 1971,\u201d Dr. Wilson said, adding that she was \u201can excellent technician.\u201d\n\nMs. Allen gave the information to Ms. Andersen, who began to look for Sheila on social media.\n\nBy March 12, she had found her. Ms. Andersen revealed that Sheila\u2019s original surname was Minor and posted snippets of their conversation, in which she said she had worked in several federal agencies for 35 years and \u201cloved every moment of my career.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was cheered by Ms. Andersen\u2019s Twitter followers, and by Ms. Shetterly, who said it was \u201ccritically important\u201d to tell the stories of people like Sheila who have historically been underrepresented, \u201cas the leaky pipeline exists in the history of science and technology as well as in its present.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Sunday, Sheila said her full name is Sheila Minor Huff. She is a retired, 71-year-old grandmother of five who belly dances, volunteers at her church and lives in Virginia.\n\nMs. Huff said she began working as an animal technician shortly after graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology. When she applied for her first job at the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, she was asked to work as a typist. \u201cI said, \u2018No, I went to school too long to be your secretary!\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nMs. Huff said she went on to complete a master\u2019s degree while working full time. She went to the Soviet Union to attend a conference for mammalogists. She worked with top government officials on a range of wildlife and environmental projects. By the time she retired, at 58, she had become a GS-14 federal employee \u2014 one of the highest designations possible \u2014 at the Department of the Interior.\n\nShe said she was not too bothered about going unnamed in the 1971 snapshot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like, no big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I try to do good, when I try and add back to this wonderful earth that we have, when I try to protect it, does it matter that anybody knows my name?\u201d", "keywords": ["working", "twitter", "went", "woman", "allen", "sheila", "ms", "shes", "women", "try", "wilson", "worked", "scientists", "identified", "38"], "polarity": 0.18714587566628382, "subjectivity": 0.40124642930765386},

In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.\n\nTo be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.\n\nBut that is changing in some corners, and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.\n\nToday there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma.

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators\u2019 perception of both.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pressure cooker,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the district\u2019s chief of schools. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across America.\u201d\n\nWhile critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.\n\nBernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\n[ALSO READ: Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys]\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "students", "punished", "national", "quandary", "black", "ms", "york", "guidance", "teachers", "confronts", "minnesota", "discipline", "districts", "school"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785},

The Times identified these cases \u2014 many of which are sealed \u2014 through interviews with lawyers, police officers and current and former judges.\n\n[ALSO READ: He Excelled as a Detective, Until Prosecutors Stopped Believing Him]\n\nIn these cases, officers have lied about the whereabouts of guns, putting them in suspects\u2019 hands or waistbands when they were actually hidden out of sight. They have barged into apartments and conducted searches, only to testify otherwise later. Under oath, they have given firsthand accounts of crimes or arrests that they did not in fact witness. They have falsely claimed to have watched drug deals happen, only to later recant or be shown to have lied.\n\nNo detail, seemingly, is too minor to embellish. \u201cClenched fists\u201d is how one Brooklyn officer described the hands of a man he claimed had angrily approached him and started screaming and yelling \u2014 an encounter that prosecutors later determined never occurred. Another officer, during a Bronx trial, accused a driver of recklessly crossing the double-yellow line \u2014 on a stretch of road that had no double-yellow line.\n\nIn many instances, the motive for lying was readily apparent: to skirt constitutional restrictions against unreasonable searches and stops. In other cases, the falsehoods appear aimed at convicting people \u2014 who may or may not have committed a crime \u2014 with trumped-up evidence.\n\nIn still others, the motive is not easy to discern. In October 2016, for example, a plainclothes Brooklyn officer gave a grand jury a first-person account of a gun arrest. Putting herself in the center of the action, the officer, Dornezia Agard, testified that as she approached a man to confront him for littering, he suddenly crouched behind a van, pulled from his waistband a dark object \u2014 later identified as a gun \u2014 and threw it on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cP.O. Agard testified that she heard a hard metal object hit the ground,\u201d according to a letter the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office wrote summarizing her testimony.\n\nBut prosecutors lost faith in her account in July 2017, after learning from other officers that she was not among the first officers on the scene. Officer Agard had arrived later as backup, according to the letter, which noted that the gun charges against the man were later dismissed. The prosecutors did not address why Officer Agard claimed to be a witness, or why the other officers present seem to have allowed her to process the arrest.\n\nPolice lying raises the likelihood that the innocent end up in jail \u2014 and that as juries and judges come to regard the police as less credible, or as cases are dismissed when the lies are discovered, the guilty will go free. Police falsehoods also impede judges\u2019 efforts to enforce constitutional limits on police searches and seizures.\n\n\u201cWe have 36,000 officers with law enforcement power, and there are a small handful of these cases every year,\u201d said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the Police Department, the nation\u2019s largest municipal force. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any of these cases any less troubling. Our goal is always, always zero. One is too many, but we have taken significant steps to combat this issue.\u201d\n\nShrouded, but Persistent\n\nThe 25 cases identified by The Times are almost certainly only a fraction of those in which officers have come under suspicion for lying in the past three years. That\u2019s because a vast majority of cases end in plea deals before an officer is ever required to take the witness stand in open court, meaning the possibility that an officer lied is seldom aired in public. And in the rare cases when an officer does testify in court \u2014 and a judge finds the testimony suspicious, leading to the dismissal of the case \u2014 the proceedings are often sealed afterward.\n\nStill, the cases identified by The Times reveal an entrenched perjury problem several decades in the making that shows little sign of fading.\n\nSo far in 2018, a Queens detective has been convicted of lying in a drug case and a Brooklyn detective has been arrested amid accusations that he fabricated the results of a photo lineup. These cases returned the phenomenon of police lying to the public eye, leaving police officials to defend the integrity of honest officers.\n\nKevin Richardson, the Police Department\u2019s top internal prosecutor, said he believed so-called testilying was nearing its end. \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s very much largely on its way out,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s tempting to think about police lying as a bygone of past eras: a form of misconduct that ran unchecked as soaring street violence left the police overwhelmed during the 1980s and early 1990s and that re-emerged as police embraced stop-and-frisk tactics and covered up constitutional violations with lies.\n\nBut false testimony by the police persists even as crime has drastically receded across the city and as the Police Department has renounced the excesses of the stop-and-frisk years.\n\nSome policing experts anticipate that the ubiquity of cameras \u2014 whether on cellphones, affixed to buildings or worn by officers \u2014 will greatly reduce police lying. For the moment, however, video seems more capable of exposing lies than vanquishing them.\n\nMemory and Manipulation\n\nIn two recent cases, The Times found, officers appear to have given false accounts about witness identifications. These cases are particularly troubling because erroneous identifications by witnesses have been a leading cause of wrongful convictions.\n\nAfter a 2016 mugging near a Brooklyn subway station, the police arrested a group of four people, one of whom was found to be in possession of the victim\u2019s wallet. In preparing the case, prosecutors sought to pin down a few basic facts. Had the police brought the victim, who was punched and had his wallet taken, to positively identify the four suspects after they were taken into custody? If so, what had the victim said?\n\nGetting a straight answer from the arresting officer, Chedanan Naurang, proved nearly impossible. It had been Officer Naurang\u2019s quick thinking that had made the arrest possible: Having lost the suspects at one subway station, he followed a hunch and drove one stop down the line, where he caught up with the four men after they got off the train.\n\nBut certain details Officer Naurang gave prosecutors kept shifting over the next year, according to a February 2017 letter that prosecutors wrote in which they summarized his fluid story.\n\nOfficer Naurang said at one point that the identification had occurred inside a police station when the victim passed by the holding cells, saw the men and confirmed their involvement in the crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ALSO READ: Two NYPD Officers Are Charged With Lying About Suspect]\n\nA few weeks later, he backtracked. No, the victim had actually never gotten to see the suspects at the police station, Officer Naurang explained. Instead, the victim had gotten a chance to view them on the street, shortly after their arrest. That\u2019s when the victim got out of the police vehicle in which he had been waiting, Officer Naurang said, and pointed to one of the four men, identifying him as an attacker.\n\nThis version of events, however, was at odds with the recollection of the police officer who had driven the victim to the scene of the arrest. That officer, Christopher McDonald, told prosecutors that the victim had remained in the back seat while viewing the four suspects. And Officer McDonald said that the victim couldn\u2019t say whether they were his assailants. He thought he recognized their clothing, but wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nBecause of Officer Naurang\u2019s changing story, prosecutors dropped the case against the men as part of a deal in which all four pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a second mugging they were accused of the same night.", "keywords": ["lying", "stubborn", "later", "suspects", "victim", "testilying", "cases", "officer", "problem", "officers", "times", "naurang", "prosecutors"], "polarity": 0.01095650381364667, "subjectivity": 0.37745734657499336},

If a young black man grabs a white woman by the crotch, he\u2019s a thug and deserves to be roughed up by police officers. But if Donald Trump grabs a white woman by the crotch in a nightclub (as he\u2019s accused of doing, and denies), it\u2019s locker-room high jinks.\n\nThis view is also expressed by many of the president\u2019s staff members, supporters and prominent allies. During the same week that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, repeatedly vouched for Rob Porter\u2019s integrity, Mr. Kelly also mused that hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants who did not fill out the paperwork for DACA protections had refused to \u201cget off their asses.\u201d\n\nA political movement that rails against \u201cimmigrant crime\u201d while defending alleged abusers and child molesters is one that has stopped pretending to have any universalist aspirations. The president\u2019s moral framework springs from an American tradition of cultivating fear and contempt among its white citizens against immigrants, indigenous people and people of color, who are placed on the other side of \u201cthe law.\u201d It\u2019s a practice that has taken on new strength at a time when many white people fear they may be outnumbered, outvoted and out of time.\n\nThis is the opposite of what we like to tell ourselves is the traditional American civic creed: one symbolized by a blindfolded Lady Justice who applies the law without fear or favor to whoever may come before her. It is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most insidious victories that he has given his supporters permission to drop any pretense of insisting that their actions and views should conform to this principle.\n\nIf all that matters when it comes to \u201claw and order\u201d is who is a friend and who is an enemy, and if friends are white and enemies are black or Latino or in the wrong party, then the rhetoric around crime and punishment stops being about justice and is merely about power and corruption.\n\nAnd this is what \u201claw and order\u201d means: the preservation of a certain social order, not the rule of law. It shouldn\u2019t have taken this long to see what has always been staring us in the face. After all, the last president to focus so intensely on law and order, Richard Nixon, the man who helped usher in mass incarceration, was also the most infamous criminal to occupy the Oval Office. The history of the United States is the story of a struggle between the desire to establish certain universal rights and the countervailing desire to preserve a particular social order.\n\nWe are now witnessing a president who wholly embraces the latter. America can have that kind of social order, or it can have justice for all.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/california-marijuana-oakland-compton.html", "text": "Several states, including Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are drawing up or have provisions in their marijuana laws to assist communities disproportionately affected by drug interdiction efforts.\n\nIn California, Oakland led the way in framing the legalization as both an opportunity to address past injustice and as a source of revenue. Yet dozens of other cities and towns across the state \u2014 including Bakersfield, Brentwood, Chico, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Mill Valley and Palo Alto \u2014 want nothing to do with recreational marijuana sales.\n\nOnly 14 percent of California\u2019s 482 cities and towns allow retail sales of recreational marijuana, according to Weedmaps, a website that hosts reviews of cannabis businesses. Californians may want access to a marijuana dispensary, just not necessarily down the block from them.\n\nWhen legalization came into effect in California in January, Oakland started a program that offered licenses to those with previous marijuana arrests. The idea, which has been copied in cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, was intended as a sort of redress for the years before legalization when blacks and other nonwhites were arrested at rates that were disproportionate to their share of the population.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs was a very specific war on a very specific community and culture,\u201d said Darlene Flynn, the director of Oakland\u2019s Department of Race and Equity.\n\nOakland\u2019s equity program goes to the heart of a paradox of legal marijuana sales in California: While large numbers of those arrested before legalization were black, most of the cannabis businesses in the post-legalization era are run by white men.\n\nLast year, Oakland produced a report showing that 77 percent of cannabis-related arrests in 2015 were of African-Americans, who make up around 30 percent of the city\u2019s 420,000 residents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of data that demonstrates that white people use and distribute drugs at the same rate as minorities do,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cThere was an extreme tilt with regards to arrests and convictions.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those with marijuana convictions, Oakland\u2019s program is open to people who lived in neighborhoods that had a particularly heavy police presence during the decades of marijuana prohibition.\n\nLike Oakland, Compton has a history of police abuse and high crime rates. In 2012, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department experimented with an aircraft that recorded high-definition images of the city, which allowed it to track everything happening on the streets. The experiment was kept secret from the city\u2019s residents until it was revealed two years later, to much outrage.\n\nBut both cities have had rising fortunes in recent years. Crime has fallen and economic prospects have brightened. The median price of a home in Compton is now $384,000, a 75 percent increase from five years ago, according to Zillow, the real estate data company. The rise has been even more dramatic in Oakland: prices have doubled in five years, to a median of $746,100.\n\nYet when the question of marijuana legalization came to Compton, residents responded with a completely different answer from Oakland.\n\nCivic and church groups in Compton banded together to campaign door-to-door against two ballot measures that would have allowed marijuana dispensaries and other cannabis manufacturing businesses.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working so hard trying to change the image of Compton,\u201d said the Rev. Stanley W. Prince, a leader of the \u201cno\u201d campaign that was victorious in the January vote. \u201cThere is an economy that can be developed without having weed as the main product.\u201d\n\nYoung people in Compton have a much smaller margin of error than people in wealthier places, Mr. Prince said. They could easily be denied jobs or be fired from them because of marijuana use.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are trying to show that it will not work in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late January, a decisive 76 percent of voters in Compton rejected the proposals that would have allowed marijuana businesses.\n\nCompton\u2019s city manager, Cecil W. Rhambo Jr., said the vote underlined the strength of underestimated conservative views on marijuana in the city, which has a population of just under 100,000.\n\nMr. Rhambo said the vote showed that the \u201ccity portrayed in rap videos is different from the values of the older people who live here, the high propensity voters.\u201d\n\nCompton still struggles with violence \u2014 there were 27 murders in 2017. But that is a fraction of the numbers in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nLongtime Compton residents, especially those who live in parts of town with neat rows of ranch houses and citrus trees, emphasize a sense of community and the household names who grew up in the city, among them the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, the actor Kevin Costner, and the former N.F.L. commissioner Pete Rozelle. (The Williams sisters returned to Compton 16 months ago for a ceremony that dedicated a set of municipal tennis courts in their name.)\n\n\u201cIt was just an idyllic place to grow up,\u201d said James Hays, 61, the owner of a medical technology company who moved to Compton as a child in 1961. \u201cYou had nice single-family homes and manicured lawns, clean streets.\u201d\n\nLike many others in the no campaign, Mr. Hays blames the town\u2019s deterioration on drugs, including marijuana.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

{"title": "\n                    Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html", "text": "Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.\n\nWhite boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.\n\nMost white boys raised in wealthy families will stay rich or upper middle class as adults, but black boys raised in similarly rich households will not. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in rich families \u2026 Replay \u21ba Adult outcomes reflect household incomes in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEven when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low poverty and good schools.\n\nAccording to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by what is happening among these boys and the men they become. Though black girls and women face deep inequality on many measures, black and white girls from families with comparable earnings attain similar individual incomes as adults.\n\nLarge income gaps persist between men \u2014 but not women. Black men consistently earn less than white men, regardless of whether they\u2019re raised poor or rich. No such income gap exists between black and white women raised in similar households.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought at some point you escape the poverty trap,\u201d said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study.\n\nBlack boys \u2014 even rich black boys \u2014 can seemingly never assume that.\n\nThe study, based on anonymous earnings and demographic data for virtually all Americans now in their late 30s, debunks a number of other widely held hypotheses about income inequality. Gaps persisted even when black and white boys grew up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar education levels and even similar levels of accumulated wealth.\n\nThe disparities that remain also can\u2019t be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. If such inherent differences existed by race, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to explain to me why these putative ability differences aren\u2019t handicapping women,\u201d said David Grusky, a Stanford sociologist who has reviewed the research.\n\nA more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores don\u2019t accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.\n\nIf this inequality can\u2019t be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home \u2014 in surrounding neighborhoods, in the economy and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.\n\n\u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea,\u201d said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nThe authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.\n\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Chetty said, \u201cis that there are essentially no such neighborhoods in America.\u201d\n\nThe few neighborhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low poverty rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets \u2014 including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx \u2014 were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.\n\nShare of children living in low-poverty neighborhoods with many fathers present\n\nShare of children living in high-poverty neighborhoods with few fathers present\n\n\u201cThat is a pathbreaking finding,\u201d said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist whose books have chronicled the economic struggles of black men. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about the direct effects of a boy\u2019s own parents\u2019 marital status. They\u2019re talking about the presence of fathers in a given census tract.\u201d\n\nOther fathers in the community can provide boys with role models and mentors, researchers say, and their presence may indicate other neighborhood factors that benefit families, like lower incarceration rates and better job opportunities.\n\nThe research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans. But the disparities are widest for black boys.\n\nFor poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys will remain poor as adults. White boys raised in poor families fare far better. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in poor families \u2026 Replay \u21ba\n\n\u201cThis crystallizes and puts data behind this thing that we always knew was there because we either felt it ourselves or we\u2019ve seen it over time,\u201d said Will Jawando, 35, who worked in the Obama White House on My Brother\u2019s Keeper, a mentoring initiative for black boys. Even without this data, the people who worked on that project, he said, believed that individual and structural racism targeted black men in ways that required policies devised specifically for them.\n\nMr. Jawando, the son of a Nigerian father and a white mother, grew up poor in Silver Spring, Md. The Washington suburb contains some of the rare neighborhoods where black and white boys appear to do equally well. Mr. Jawando, who identifies as black, is now a married lawyer with three daughters. He is among the black boys who climbed from the bottom to the top.\n\nWill Jawando was raised in a low-income household in Silver Spring, Md. A lawyer and a former Obama White House staffer, he is among the rare black boys who reached the top fifth of the income distribution as an adult. T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nHe was one of the 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 whose lives are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their parents\u2019 incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.\n\nPrevious research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between women, even though women of color face both sexism and racism.\n\nOther studies show that boys, across races, are more sensitive than girls to disadvantages like growing up in poverty or facing discrimination. While black women also face negative effects of racism, black men often experience racial discrimination differently. As early as preschool, they are more likely to be disciplined in school. They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just being black but being male that has been hyper-stereotyped in this negative way, in which we\u2019ve made black men scary, intimidating, with a propensity toward violence,\u201d said Noelle Hurd, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nShe said this racist stereotype particularly hurts black men economically, now that service-sector jobs, requiring interaction with customers, have replaced the manufacturing jobs that previously employed men with less education.\n\nThe new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent \u2014 by millionaires \u2014 were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about $36,000.\n\nThe sons of black families from the top 1 percent had about the same chance of being incarcerated on a given day as the sons of white families earning $36,000. Share of the men incarcerated on April 1, 2010 Includes men who were ages 27 to 32 in 2010.\n\nAt the same time, boys benefit more than girls from adult attention and resources, as do low-income and nonwhite children, a variety of studies have found. Mentors who aren\u2019t children\u2019s parents, but who share those children\u2019s gender and race, serve a particularly important role for black children, Ms. Hurd has found. That helps explain why the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood, even if not in a child\u2019s home, appears to make a difference.\n\nSome of the widest black-white income gaps in this study appear in wealthy communities. This fits with previous research that has shown that the effects of racial discrimination cross class lines. Although all children benefit from growing up in places with higher incomes and more resources, black children do not benefit nearly as much as white children do. Moving black boys to opportunity is no guarantee they can tap into it.\n\n\u201cSimply because you\u2019re in an area that is more affluent, it\u2019s still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality,\u201d said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent black people.\n\nThis dynamic still weighs on Mr. Jawando. He has a good income, multiple degrees and political aspirations \u2014 he is running for county council in Montgomery County, where he grew up. But in his own community, he is careful to dress like a professional.\n\n\u201cI think if I\u2019m putting on a sweatsuit, if I go somewhere, will I be seen as just kind of a hood black guy?\u201d he said. \u201cOr will people recognize me at all?\u201d Those small daily decisions \u2014 to wear a blazer or not \u2014 follow him despite his success. \u201cI don\u2019t think you escape those things,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Findings From the Research\n\nThis study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.\n\nThere\u2019s a large gap in the marriage rates of white and black Americans, even after accounting for income. Percent of the children married in 2015 Includes men and women who were ages 32 to 37 in 2015.\n\nOne reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and women are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income \u2014 not two. For this reason and others, many point to differences in family structure as a primary driver of racial income inequality. If black children don\u2019t have married parents, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.\n\nThis study found, however, that broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they\u2019re raised in homes with the same incomes and the same family structure.\n\nThe income gap exists for black and white boys if they had one parent in the house or two.\n\nAs this chart shows, a black man raised by two parents together in the 90th percentile \u2014 making around $140,000 a year \u2014 earns about the same in adulthood as a white man raised by a single mother making $60,000 alone.\n\nThe high mobility rate for Asian-Americans is partly about immigration. Based on a sample of the children. Few Native Americans have immigrant mothers; their differences in income are not meaningful.\n\nAsian-Americans earn more in adulthood than whites who were raised in families with similar incomes. But that advantage largely disappears when the researchers look only at children whose parents were born in the United States. Non-immigrant Asian-Americans fare about as well in the economy as whites. (The study did not divide immigrant mothers into smaller groups by origin.)\n\nThe worst places for poor white children are almost all better than the best places for poor black children. Average income of white children from poor families Average income of all children from poor families Average income of black children from poor families\n\nIn previous work, some of these same researchers looked at how the prospects for poor children vary depending on where they grow up. The middle map above shows those earlier results: Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, it\u2019s now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.\n\nPoor white children struggle in parts of the Southeast and Appalachia. But they still fare better there than poor black children do in most of America. In effect, the worst places for whites produce outcomes that are about as good as the best places for blacks. These new maps also suggest that part of the reason the Southeast looks bad for all children, in the middle map, is that the region is home to many black children who fare particularly poorly there.\n\nVery few nonwhite Americans started at the very top. Income distribution of the children in the study Excludes those reporting multiple races and those for whom no race was identified.\n\nAfrican-Americans made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution. They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.\n\nThe Real Starting Positions\n\nThe ladder charts so far have shown equal numbers of black and white boys raised by rich or poor families \u2014 what would happen, in other words, if we started with 10,000 boys, and half were black and half white.\n\nIn reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families.

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators\u2019 perception of both.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pressure cooker,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the district\u2019s chief of schools. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across America.\u201d\n\nWhile critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.\n\nBernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\n[ALSO READ: Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys]\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "students", "punished", "national", "quandary", "black", "ms", "york", "guidance", "teachers", "confronts", "minnesota", "discipline", "districts", "school"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785},

It often meets at odd hours and in rushed circumstances, exacerbating the partisan sniping. Both as chairwoman and the top member of the minority, Ms. Slaughter found ways to keep things on an even keel.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShe was a force to be reckoned with who always brought her spunk, fire and dynamic leadership to every meeting,\u201d said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, who now leads the panel and jousted with Ms. Slaughter for years. \u201cLouise was a fearless leader, deeply committed to her constituents, and a dear friend.\u201d He added that he would always \u201ccherish our friendship, camaraderie and, of course, her rhubarb pie.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps Ms. Slaughter\u2019s biggest moment in the limelight was during House machinations over the health care bill in 2010. The loss of a crucial 60th vote in the Senate with the death of Edward M. Kennedy had handcuffed House Democrats who had no choice but to pass a Senate bill with some provisions they didn\u2019t like if they wanted to send a bill to the White House. To limit the political pain, Democrats cooked up an approach that would have essentially deemed the bill passed under what is known in Congress as a self-executing rule, allowing Democrats to avoid a direct vote on those objectionable provisions.\n\nThough Republicans had done the same thing in the past, they howled and mocked Ms. Slaughter with catchy phrases such as \u201cSlaughter House Rules.\u201d Democrats eventually came up with another approach, but Republicans continued to complain, leading the plain-spoken Ms. Slaughter to fire back that their convoluted dispute over procedure was just subterfuge.\n\n\u201cIn reality, it\u2019s about blocking much-needed health care reform in this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who oppose the process don\u2019t want any debate or votes on health care itself. They just want to make reform go away.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, one of her top priorities was an ethics measure intended to prevent lawmakers and other federal officials from profiting in the stock market from inside knowledge. This was one instance that cost her some friends in the House. Representative Chris Collins, a Republican from a neighboring New York district, described her to Fox News as a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d after she complained to House ethics watchdogs about his efforts on behalf of a biotech company in which he owned stock.\n\nMs. Slaughter, the oldest member of the House at her death, had been weighing re-election and was being encouraged to run again and perhaps regain her chairmanship should Democrats take back the House.

Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation\u2019s vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bol\u00edvar, and quadruple-digit inflation.\n\nSenior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.\n\nWhether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government,\u201d said Cynthia J.

Am\u00e9rico Alex Mata Garc\u00eda is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro\u2019s presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.\n\nThe four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.\n\nThe sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.\n\nOne Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.\n\nVenezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could \u201cexpose U.S. persons to legal risk.\u201d\n\nThe executive order, with its explicit ban, is likely to serve as a warning for other countries that have been looking at issuing virtual currencies to work around international sanctions. Russian government officials have discussed creating a so-called crypto ruble for similar purposes, but have not moved ahead with the plan so far.\n\nRisa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela \u2014 the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro\u2019s grandiose claims, she said \u2014 the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic,\u201d Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday\u2019s measures. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,\u201d both in Venezuela and in the United States.", "keywords": ["white", "digital", "mr", "imposes", "venezuelan", "currency", "trump", "venezuelas", "sanctions", "bans", "maduro", "officials", "petro", "house", "venezuela", "united"], "polarity": 0.04665363046044865, "subjectivity": 0.348984774695002},

By 1968, as David Halberstam wrote in a book at the time, \u201cThe easy old coalition between labor and Negroes was no longer so easy; it barely existed. The two were among the American forces most in conflict.\u201d\n\nBut Kennedy waited to enter the race until March 16, 1968, only after the peace candidate Eugene McCarthy had challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson and locked up the support of many young people and highly educated whites, who were pro-civil rights and skeptical of the war. As a result, Kennedy had to try to appeal simultaneously to minority voters and white working-class constituencies who were part of the backlash against racial progress and the peace movement. This was especially true in Kennedy\u2019s first primary state, Indiana, where Gov. George Wallace of Alabama had shocked observers four years earlier by getting strong support from white ethnic precincts when he challenged Johnson for the Democratic nomination.\n\nKennedy sought to build his unlikely coalition in part by running an economically populist campaign that vilified wealthy tax cheats and earned him the enmity of business leaders. \u201cWe have to convince the Negroes and the poor whites that they have common interests,\u201d he told the journalist Jack Newfield.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Kennedy knew that a populist economic message would not get through to working-class whites unless it was accompanied by a respect for their beliefs on issues like crime, welfare and patriotism. Gerard Doherty, one of his aides, recalled speaking to Kennedy: \u201cI said if he was going to win, he has to conduct a campaign for sheriff of Indiana. And he did.\u201d Coupled with strong support for civil rights, Kennedy\u2019s message about punishing looters got through. At one point during the campaign, Richard Nixon remarked to the reporter Theodore White, \u201cDo you know a lot of these people think Bobby is more a law-and-order man than I am!\u201d\n\nKennedy also campaigned on the dignity of work over welfare. In a TV commercial, he declared, \u201cI think welfare is demeaning and destructive of the human being and of his family.\u201d He didn\u2019t blame \u201cwelfare queens\u201d for cheating the system, as Ronald Reagan later would, but said he envisioned a policy of full employment in which a person could say to himself: \u201cI helped build this country. I am a participant in its greatest public venture.\u201d\n\nOn issues of national security, Kennedy took a principled position in opposition to the Vietnam War \u2014 whose very morality he questioned \u2014 but threaded the needle in a way that also made clear to working-class voters that he differed sharply from upper-middle-class white college students who avoided service or even sympathized with the North Vietnamese Communists. At Notre Dame, Kennedy was booed for saying college draft deferments should be abolished. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the unfair advantage while poor people are being drafted,\u201d he said. Remarkably, in Indiana he polled as well among those who favored Johnson\u2019s conduct of the Vietnam War as he did among those who opposed it.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign to woo working-class voters across racial lines worked. The candidate most identified with advancing civil rights did well not only with black and Hispanic voters but also among working-class whites, some of whom had supported Wallace\u2019s segregationist candidacy in 1964.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA half-century later, how could progressives try to rebuild the Bobby Kennedy coalition? Kennedy\u2019s appeal was based in part on being the brother of a revered and martyred president, of course, and the most salient issues were different in 1968 than they are today. But Kennedy stressed fundamental themes that travel across time and transcend specific policy issues.\n\nFirst, to appeal to a sizable number of white working-class voters in 1968, Kennedy did not forfeit his basic principles or change his positions on civil rights, or war and peace \u2014 and neither should progressives today. Ignoring the rights of women, gay people and people of color is both morally wrong and politically stupid if your aspiration is an inclusive populism.\n\nSecond, progressives should fight for economic justice in a manner that is relentless rather than episodic. On the campaign trail, Kennedy consistently hit themes of economic inequality and named the names of wealthy individuals, like the oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, who paid little in taxes. By contrast, in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton de-emphasized economic issues in favor of attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s qualifications, according to research by Democracy Corps and the Roosevelt Institute, and his support among white non-college voters rose considerably. Progressives also need to vigorously punish Wall Street malfeasance. It is difficult to imagine that Kennedy, a tough prosecutor, would have argued, as some members of the Obama administration did, that some companies are \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d\n\nThird, progressives should explicitly signal the inclusion of working-class whites in their vision for change by applying civil rights laws to issues of class inequality, consistent with Kennedy\u2019s view that \u201cpoverty is closer to the root of the problem than color.\u201d I have long argued that we should extend the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against workers of all races engaged in labor organizing; integrate elementary and secondary schools not only by race but also by socioeconomic status; combat discrimination in housing by economic status as well as race; and adopt affirmative action programs in higher education for economically disadvantaged students of every color.\n\nFourth, progressives could adopt policies that respect the values of working-class people under the banner of patriotic populism, as Kennedy did. They should unapologetically champion a strong American identity around the shared values espoused in the Declaration of Independence as an antidote to exclusionary white nationalism.\n\nAn inclusive patriotic populism would be much more racially tolerant than Mr. Trump\u2019s white nationalism, and it would be tougher on national and domestic security than the populism offered by Mr. Sanders. If Robert Kennedy, the civil rights champion, could attract Wallace voters at a time of national chaos, surely the right progressive candidate with the right message could bring a significant portion of the Obama-Trump voters back home. Doing so would not only bring electoral success but also make it easier to forge a more economically progressive public policy to address America\u2019s dangerous economic divide.", "keywords": ["white", "war", "whites", "kennedy", "voters", "bobby", "economic", "civil", "workingclass", "progressives", "pathway", "rights"], "polarity": 0.1222115912602638, "subjectivity": 0.4557301204203861},

The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.\n\nDr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHe ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data harvesting.

In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook\u2019s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.\n\nBut the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.\n\nWhat is Facebook doing in response?\n\nThe company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan\u2019s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan\u2019s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.\n\nFacebook also said: \u201cSeveral days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted.

It carefully balances the department\u2019s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos.

They are joined in the suit by Turning Point for Women and Families, a nonprofit based in Queens concerned about the impact of police policies on victims of domestic violence who wind up arrested.\n\nMr. Cahn and lawyers from the firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, who represent the plaintiffs, contend that the police practices are unreasonable and violate the plaintiffs\u2019 religious freedom under both the First Amendment and federal law.\n\nThe issue highlights the gulf between criminal justice policy, as it has evolved over time, and the cultural and religious obligations of those in custody. As it stands now, the city\u2019s policy explicitly says \u201cthe arrestee\u2019s head covering must be removed\u201d for the department\u2019s official photograph.

Yet critics say the policy is confounding.\n\nFor one, it only deals with the treatment of civilians in those brief moments when their photographs are being snapped. The accommodations the policy calls for are not consistently practiced, critics say. And when they are, they are often conveyed as a warning by officers who tell arrestees that asking for a private photograph could lengthen the arrest processing time and lead to longer detention, said Mr. Cahn. He said Ms. Aziz took such warnings as a threat.\n\nEven more significantly, Mr. Cahn said, the photograph policy does not address the fact that photos exist, possibly to be cataloged and disseminated in the future.\n\n\u201cEach time someone sees a photo of them uncovered, it feels like a new betrayal of their fundamental rights,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, when the city last month settled three separate cases brought by Muslims who said that removing their hijabs for photos violated their religious rights, it had the effect of papering over important nuances in the department\u2019s ongoing treatment of arrestees while staying silent on whether the policy would be altered. The city gave $60,000 to each woman, but said only that doing so was \u201cin the best interest\u201d of all sides without elaborating.\n\nAlso, the settlements are \u201climited to only those people who have already come forward,\u201d said O. Andrew F. Wilson, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cAnd it does nothing to help those women and men who are forced to remove head coverings in the future, or even in the past who haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cahn added that for New Yorkers of different religions, the undercutting of their faith values offers government only slight benefit since many law enforcement experts believe that effective identification is not reliant on the removal of head coverings.\n\nFor driver\u2019s licenses issued in New York, those sitting for a photo can wear hats, scarves or head coverings as long as their entire face is visible and the covering does not cast a shadow. Likewise, the State Police in New York are unaware of any case where a state trooper made an arrestee remove a hijab if their face was visible, said officials of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration.\n\nFederally, the State Department has no requirement that such religious headwear be removed for passport photos. Several police departments around the country, too, see the removal of religious headwear as unnecessary.\n\nThe lawsuit says the city\u2019s policy only \u201calienates and oppresses faith communities.\u201d In interviews, Ms. Clark and Ms. Aziz said their encounters with officers had eroded their trust in the police.\n\nRobina Niaz, the executive director of Turning Point for Women and Families, said fear among Muslim women of the police was deterring them from stepping forward to report episodes of child abuse and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s post-9/11 climate, New York City is beset with widespread hostility toward and baseless fear of Muslim-Americans,\u201d the suit says. \u201cIn the context of this increasingly polarized setting, it is incumbent on this city\u2019s law enforcement to increase awareness of and sensitivity toward the Muslim-American community.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Aziz, a daughter of Palestinian immigrants who is married and has two adult children, her encounter with police has fed residual pain. \u201cI just felt like I was broken,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broke me.\u201d", "keywords": ["lawsuit", "removal", "prompts", "departments", "head", "women", "taken", "york", "religious", "ms", "cahn", "photograph", "hijab", "policy"], "polarity": 0.07382182211727667, "subjectivity": 0.3865173652105469},

Hopefuls in 2018 Re-Election Poll Image Less than eight months before Election Day, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo holds a commanding lead over his Democratic and Republican challengers, according to a Siena College poll. Credit Dave Sanders for The New York Times\n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo is entering his re-election campaign with a commanding lead over both his Republican rivals and a possible Democratic primary opponent, the actress Cynthia Nixon, according to a new poll from Siena College.\n\n\n\nThe survey shows Mr. Cuomo ahead of Ms. Nixon among Democratic voters by 66 percent to 19 percent. He leads her by a wide margin among every subgroup in the survey: men and women, moderates and liberals, black, white and Latino voters, upstate and New York City residents.\n\nBest known for her role in \u201cSex and the City,\u201d Ms. Nixon entered the contest only Monday, after the poll had been completed, but had said she was exploring a bid and had been in contact with political strategists with experience running progressive campaigns. A longtime education activist in the state, Ms. Nixon has the benefit of name recognition, and yet remains broadly unknown to voters, with 60 percent saying they had no opinion of her.\n\nThe poll showed Mr. Cuomo with a two-to-one advantage over both his potential Republican challengers, State Senator John DeFrancisco and Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, who is expected to formally declare his candidacy at the beginning of April.\n\nMr. Cuomo had a 52 percent approval rating in the survey, essentially unchanged from a month earlier.\n\nThe survey was conducted as the two-month corruption trial of one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s former top aides, Joseph Percoco, ended in a guilty verdict last week. Mr. Cuomo and his team regularly emphasized that the governor himself was not charged with wrongdoing in the case.\n\nThe State Democratic Party also spent $100,000 last week, while the poll was being conducted, on a television ad in the New York City area promoting Mr. Cuomo\u2019s record on gun control.\n\n\u201cMostly, this survey provides the governor with good news,\u201d said Steven Greenberg, who conducted the poll.\n\nImage Cynthia Nixon, the actress best known for her work in the \u201cSex and the City\u201d franchise, is still something of an unknown quantity as a prospective candidate; 60 percent of respondents in a Siena College poll said they had no opinion of her. Credit Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nMr. Greenberg noted that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s job-approval rating did slide to 42 percent, with the percentage of New York voters who said he was doing a poor job rising to 25 percent, equaling the high in a Siena College poll.\n\nSince his 2014 re-election, Mr. Cuomo has tacked to the left politically, passing an increase in the minimum wage, paid family leave and other measures as his political operation has tried to rebrand him as a progressive after a first term in which he emphasized governing from the political center.\n\nIn the poll, more New Yorkers, 46 percent, rated Mr. Cuomo as a \u201cliberal\u201d than in any past survey. That is more than double the 21 percent who said in February 2011, his second month in office, that he was a liberal.\n\nBut among Democratic voters, a majority, 52 percent, still viewed Mr. Cuomo as a moderate, compared with only 34 percent of Democrats who labeled him a liberal.\n\nMs. Nixon is expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the political left. She has been in talks with former advisers to Mayor Bill de Blasio, Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, two architects of his 2013 mayoral bid.\n\n\u201cOne of the ideas that\u2019s out there, that\u2019s floating among the chattering class is that Cuomo has a problem with liberals,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s a canard. The truth is Cuomo has a problem with liberal leadership.\u201d\n\nOver all, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s standing heading into his re-election year appears to have slightly deteriorated from four years ago.\n\nIn March 2014, a Siena College survey had 49 percent of New York voters saying they intended to vote to re-elect Mr. Cuomo, with 41 percent saying they preferred an alternative.\n\nThis month\u2019s poll showed a 48-percent-to-46-percent split on the same question.\n\nThe statewide poll was conducted from March 11 to 16, with 772 registered New York voters, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

He brought a series of people to the podium, including an ICE agent and parents whose eldest son died of a fentanyl overdose, to tell their stories.\n\nThe plan the president described, which was based on recommendations by an opioid commission the president appointed last year, has the goal of reducing the supply of illicit drugs with better interdiction and tougher penalties, reducing opioid prescriptions and overall demand for opioids, and expanding access to treatment and recovery tools like the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.\n\nThe plan seeks to cut the number of opioid prescriptions filled by a third within three years, a restriction that will face opposition from critics who argue it could have unintended consequences for people with chronic and even acute pain, and that it instead could force some users to seek more dangerous drugs, like heroin and synthetic fentanyl.\n\nOfficials were vague about how the prescriptions would be reduced, saying only that a main goal would be for prescribers for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs to follow guidelines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published two years ago. Those guidelines recommended that doctors first try ibuprofen and aspirin to treat pain, and that opioid treatment for short-term pain last no more than a week.\n\nThe plan says little about how addiction treatment would be expanded besides a vague goal of expanding access to \u201cevidence-based addiction treatment\u201d in every state, particularly for members of the military, for veterans and their families and for people leaving jail or prison.\n\nDrug overdoses killed roughly 64,000 people in the United States in 2016, according to initial estimates from the C.D.C., and have become the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Congress recently allotted $6 billion to address the epidemic over the next two years, which public health experts have described as a good start but not anywhere near enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president also called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid to cover much of the addiction treatment provided around the United States over the past few years.\n\nIn his State of the State address last month, Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican who was on hand for the president\u2019s speech, called the opioid crisis the state\u2019s \u201cmost serious challenge.\u201d\n\nVoters have agreed, with 53 percent saying in a Granite State poll last year that drugs were the biggest problem facing the state \u2014 the first time in the poll\u2019s history that a majority labeled a single issue the most important.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s push for the death penalty for drug traffickers could play well with voters here, as New Hampshire is the only state in New England that still allows capital punishment, though it has not executed anyone since 1939.\n\nIn statements after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, the state\u2019s two Democratic senators \u2014 Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan \u2014 said they generally supported many of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals. Neither senator\u2019s statement directly addressed the president\u2019s call for the death penalty for traffickers, but Ms. Hassan\u2019s aides said that in comments earlier in the day, she had opposed the death penalty for traffickers.\n\n\u201cI think it reflects a lack of a broader understanding of the factors in this crisis,\u201d Ms. Hassan told Fosters.com, a news site. \u201cWe have to go after demand as well as supply, and law enforcement have been the first people to tell us we can\u2019t enforce our way out of this.\u201d\n\nAsked for clarification of her view on Monday, Ms. Shaheen \u2014 who, when she was governor of New Hampshire in 2000, vetoed a bill that would have repealed the state\u2019s death penalty \u2014 said through her spokeswoman: \u201cFrankly, whether a drug dealer, after exhausting all of their legal appeals, gets the death penalty 20 years from now has no impact on our immediate crisis.\u201d\n\nShe said Mr. Trump should be providing more money for the police, emergency medical workers and families in need of treatment.\n\nCivil liberties lawyers were highly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of the death penalty for traffickers and said it would be unworkable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere has never been an execution under the one part of United States law that allows the death penalty as a punishment for traffickers,\u201d said Ames Grawert, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York. \u201cThe Supreme Court has consistently refused to sanction the use of the death penalty in crimes other than homicide.\u201d", "keywords": ["details", "unveiling", "state", "plan", "opioids", "offers", "mr", "tough", "combat", "trumps", "trump", "states", "treatment", "talk", "death", "opioid", "traffickers", "penalty"], "polarity": 0.06140849282296653, "subjectivity": 0.3570915926179083},

But many later left their designated homes, gravitating to areas that already had a high concentration of migrants.\n\nEssen, a city of 600,000 people, has seen its Syrian community grow to nearly 11,000 from 1,300 in 2015, said Peter Renzel, who is in charge of social policy at City Hall.

Some have banned young men from signing up \u2014 in theory not to target migrants, but in practice exactly that.\n\nSitting in his crammed office in Essen one recent morning, arms defiantly crossed over his substantial belly, Mr. Sartor scoffed. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not saying it.\u201d\n\nA former coal worker who retired early when his mine shut down, Mr. Sartor has run the food bank for 12 years as a volunteer.\n\nHe has deliberately left the Nazi graffiti on the door and on the charity\u2019s seven delivery vans, which have also been defaced. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil three years ago, roughly one in three food bank users were foreigners, he said. By last November, it was three in four.\n\nPhoto\n\nFood bank users normally sign up for a year\u2019s pass, after demonstrating proof of need. It was Mr. Sartor\u2019s idea to block any more non-Germans from signing up, at least temporarily. The food bank continues to serve those foreigners already on its lists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen a message about the new policy went up on the food bank\u2019s website on Dec. 8, no one complained. It was only when the local newspaper wrote about it last month that the decision suddenly exploded into the national news.\n\nGiven the controversy, representatives from the food bank, the city and migrant groups met over the weekend and agreed that the ban would be lifted \u201cas soon as possible\u201d \u2014 but only after the numbers of migrants and native Germans evened out.\n\nFor now, the share of foreigners among food bank users is still 60 percent, Mr. Sartor said.\n\nOne of his 120 fellow volunteers resigned in protest over the decision. But those handing out bread, fish, vegetables and fruit on a recent afternoon said that something had to be done.\n\nOne of them, Steffi Tamm, had just gotten off the phone with an older woman who was inquiring whether it was \u201csafe\u201d to come back to the food bank. \u201cHave those young men gone?\u201d she asked.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome of the threat, said Ms. Tamm, is more perceived than real.

The charity has grown to 60,000 volunteers and serves 1.5 million people across Germany. Many of them have experienced similar tensions.\n\nSabine Werth, who now runs the Berlin subsidiary, founded the network in 1993, when a wave of homelessness swept across her city. \u201cOne of our founding principles is that we serve according to need, not origin,\u201d said Ms. Werth, 61.\n\nWhat Mr. Sartor has done, she said, amounts to \u201cGermany First.\u201d\n\nBut Germany First is popular with many, as Ms. Werth has learned the hard way in recent days. \u201cCockroach,\u201d \u201cpiece of dirt\u201d and \u201cforeigner\u2019s slut\u201d are some of the insults that have landed in her inbox.

Last year, Australia agreed to pay $53 million in damages to migrants who said they had suffered abuse in the camps.\n\nMr. Dutton has been a staunch defender of the offshore detention policy, and he has argued that Australia should not accept refugees who would be a burden on the country\u2019s social safety net.\n\nIn January, Mr. Dutton blamed African migrants for a rise in crime in Melbourne, claiming in an interview that residents of the city were afraid even to go to restaurants at night \u201cbecause they\u2019re followed home by these gangs.\u201d\n\nCritics of the government said that those remarks were intended to scare voters before an election and that official crime data showed no such correlation with immigration.\n\nAccording to government statistics, more immigrants to Australia are born in South Africa than in any other African country. As of 2016, 181,400 Australian residents were South African natives, according to the latest census. The government does not break down that figure by race, but white South Africans have been moving to Australia in large numbers for decades.\n\nThe question of redistributing white-owned farmland to blacks in South Africa became an issue again in February when Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president.", "keywords": ["white", "visas", "emergency", "calls", "australian", "dutton", "mr", "race", "africa", "york", "african", "australia", "migrants", "official", "farmers", "sign", "south"], "polarity": 0.0395820449391878, "subjectivity": 0.26645923520923526},

The story at the heart of the case was published in The Wall Street Journal in October 2016, just days before the election as the F.B.I. raced to review newly discovered emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server. The Journal revealed a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to handle a separate Clinton investigation, one into her family\u2019s foundation.\n\nMr. McCabe authorized an F.B.I. spokesman and lawyer to speak to The Journal to rebut suggestions that he had put the brakes on the investigation. These types of interactions between journalists and government officials \u2014 known as \u201cbackground calls\u201d \u2014 are common in all federal agencies and administrations as officials try to correct inaccuracies or provide details and nuance before reporters publish information.\n\nThe Journal ultimately reported that while Justice Department officials did not authorize subpoenas, the F.B.I. in fact had pressed ahead with the case \u2014 a detail that if anything was damaging to Mrs. Clinton, not Mr. Trump.\n\nDid the White House Fire Mr. McCabe?\n\nNo. As a career civil servant, Mr. McCabe is not a political appointee who can be summarily dismissed by the president. But this is where the situation gets complicated. Mr. Trump has repeatedly used his Twitter account to attack Mr. McCabe. Months before the firing, he taunted Mr. McCabe about his pension.\n\nAnd he goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against Mr. McCabe.\n\nOn the eve of Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called him a \u201cbad actor.\u201d Taken together, this unusual level of White House commentary created a political backdrop to what should have been an independent government personnel decision. Mr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers seized on that as evidence of improper influence.\n\n\u201cThis distortion of the process begins at the very top, with the president\u2019s repeated offensive, drive-by Twitter attacks on Mr. McCabe.\u201d \u2014 Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer for Mr. McCabe\n\nWhy Was He Fired So Quickly?\n\nThat is one of the big unknowns. F.B.I. disciplinary matters can drag out for extended periods, and it is not uncommon for officials to retire during that process. That did not happen here, and it is not clear why. The workings of the F.B.I.\u2019s disciplinary office are kept confidential.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers say they were given little time to read and respond to the final report and were still receiving new evidence two days before his firing. Why the rush, they ask, if not to make sure that Mr. McCabe was fired?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis concerted effort to accelerate the process, in order to beat the ticking clock of his scheduled retirement, violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,\u201d Mr. Bromwich said.\n\nWhat\u2019s the President\u2019s Beef With Mr. McCabe?\n\nMr. Trump has seized on the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from a political ally of Mrs. Clinton. He says Mr. McCabe never should have been allowed to oversee the Clinton investigation. He says the campaign donations are proof that a pro-Clinton bias within the F.B.I. explains why Mrs. Clinton was never charged.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife on several occasions, including a face-to-face meeting in which the president called her a \u201closer.\u201d\n\nDoes Mr. Trump\u2019s Criticism Have Merit?\n\nYes and no. Mr. McCabe did not begin supervising the Clinton investigation until after his wife had lost the race, and records show that he sought ethics and legal advice inside the F.B.I. before deciding not to recuse himself. But some in the F.B.I. believe he should never have been involved because of his wife\u2019s campaign donations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhen he ultimately recused himself, late in the investigation, it only fueled the argument that he should have stepped aside from the beginning.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s theory of Mr. McCabe as a pro-Clinton partisan, however, is on far shakier ground. Mr. McCabe has identified himself as a lifelong Republican and did not vote in the 2016 election. The newspaper story that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials speak about was not a positive one for Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, in the months before the election, when the F.B.I. publicly disclosed information about its work on the Clinton investigation, it never revealed the existence and scope of a full-throated investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s Russia ties.\n\nWhat Does This Possibly Have to Do with Russia?\n\nLike so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing has become inextricably entangled in presidential politics and the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nMr. McCabe was one of only a handful of F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation from the first days. He supervised it at every step and was involved in the decision to seek a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump foreign adviser. That wiretap application was approved by senior Justice Department officials, was reapproved by Mr. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department and was signed by a federal judge based on evidence that Mr. Page was a Russian agent. Mr. Trump has declared that wiretap to be improper, however, and points to it as evidence of political surveillance by the F.B.I.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McCabe also worked alongside the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who accused Mr. Trump of seeking a loyalty oath and pressing him to end the investigation. Those conversations are now part of an obstruction investigation. Mr. McCabe kept memos on his conversations with Mr. Comey, which could help investigators corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s account.\n\nMr. McCabe argues that the Trump administration is trying to discredit him as a potential witness. The real target, Mr. McCabe said, is Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mr. Trump\u2019s team seemingly gave credence to that argument last weekend when the Daily Beast asked for Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer for a comment on Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing and he responded with a call to end the Mueller investigation.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, if Mr. Trump discredits Mr. McCabe, he can raise questions about everything Mr. McCabe has touched \u2014 including the Russia investigation. Mr. McCabe\u2019s allies have come to his defense.\n\nWell, He Did Lie, Right?\n\nWhat we know right now is that Mr. Sessions found repeated examples in which Mr. McCabe \u201clacked candor.\u201d And career officials \u2014 not Trump appointees \u2014 recommended dismissal. Mr. Sessions accepted that recommendation.\n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.\n\nMr. McCabe denies being untruthful. He says he answered every question honestly and, when he was misunderstood, he reached out to the investigators to correct the record.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to assess the allegations, or Mr. McCabe\u2019s defense, until the inspector general\u2019s report is released. That is expected sometime this spring. Mr. McCabe has seen it but cannot discuss it until it is public. When it is released, his lawyers say, he has a point-by-point rebuttal to offer.", "keywords": ["fbi", "clinton", "political", "mr", "trumps", "know", "trump", "officials", "mccabe", "mccabes", "andrew", "heres", "investigation", "firing"], "polarity": 0.07054808286951143, "subjectivity": 0.4370853947639662},

They have followed requests from immigration authorities to hold detainees suspected of being in the country illegally \u2014 another provision in S.B. 4 \u2014 while reassuring anxious and outraged immigrants in their communities.\n\nAfter the ruling on Tuesday, the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, made an unscheduled appearance at a rally by opponents of the law outside City Hall. \u201cIt remains my position that the Houston Police Department is not U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and H.P.D. should not function as an arm of ICE,\u201d Mr. Turner said later in a statement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nSupporters of the law viewed the ruling as a victory, including conservative leaders in other states seeking to pass similar bans on sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Florida tried but failed to pass a bill banning sanctuary cities this legislative session. But the Republican speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran, who has pushed for a crackdown, said the ruling on Tuesday in the Texas case would help their cause.\n\n\u201cThe linchpin of the sanctuary defenders\u2019 argument was that courts would find such legislation unconstitutional,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said in a statement. \u201cWe knew they were wrong, and today the court agreed. Any elected official who thinks they can choose which laws they will and will not follow is sadly mistaken and this ruling reinforces that fundamental American truth.\u201d\n\nIn addition to prohibiting sanctuary policies, S.B. 4 threatens officials who violate the law with fines, jail time and removal from office. The measure was backed by the state\u2019s Republican governor and lieutenant governor, and passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nAustin, Dallas, Houston and other cities and counties sued Texas to block the law, saying it was unconstitutional, opened the door to racial profiling and would make documented and undocumented immigrants fearful of reporting crimes and cooperating with the police.\n\nThe ruling on Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit only complicates the situation. Parts of the law went into effect after a court ruling in September. The Fifth Circuit opinion allows nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions to kick in, although lawyers for the localities and groups suing the state said they were considering appealing the decision to either the full Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite upholding most of the law\u2019s provisions, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision could narrow the effect of the law. The ruling suggested that local officials who limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement because of limited resources were not necessarily violating the law.\n\n\u201cIt is not 100 percent obvious what is allowed and not allowed as far as policymaking,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents San Antonio and other jurisdictions and groups in the lawsuit. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be put into effect in the field.\u201d\n\nThe Fifth Circuit judges struck down one provision of the law \u2014 a clause that had barred officials even from endorsing policies that limit immigration enforcement, which the judges said violated the First Amendment. But some local leaders are concerned that the free speech rights of city employees remain restricted by the law, because the judges lifted the endorsement prohibition only for elected officials and not for nonelected government personnel.\n\nOn Wednesday in San Antonio, some of those dynamics seemed to be at play. Shortly before the start of a news conference held by groups opposed to the law, Councilman Rey Salda\u00f1a wondered whether the city\u2019s police chief, William McManus, would speak at the event. Mr. Salda\u00f1a invited Chief McManus \u2014 who is an appointed official, not an elected one \u2014 but the chief did not attend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m protected according to the Fifth Circuit, because I\u2019m an elected official, but the police chief is not,\u201d Mr. Salda\u00f1a said. \u201cHe works for the city.

According to the 2016-18 report on Cancer Facts and Figures for African-Americans, \u201cdespite lower incidence rates for breast and uterine cancers, black women have death rates for these cancers that are 42 percent and 92 percent higher, respectively, than white women.\u201d Investigators connect the ghastly numbers to the usual socioeconomic discrepancies but also to biological differences in the malignancies of black women.\n\nWith regard to breast cancer, is the mortality gap related to a greater percentage of black women than white women contending with an aggressive form of the disease that lacks estrogen receptors?\n\nDr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, rejects an explanation based on \u201cbiological difference,\u201d pointing instead to dietary disparities.\n\nDisadvantaged Americans consume more calories and carbohydrates, \u201cthe sort of food that is available in poor areas of inner cities,\u201d Dr. Brawley writes in his book \u201cHow We Do Harm.\u201d Greater body weight means African-American girls menstruate earlier and the number of uninterrupted menstrual cycles increases the risk of breast cancer: \u201cThe black-white gap in the onset of menstruation and body weight has dramatically widened, which means that the disease disparities will widen also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Brawley quotes an all-white study in Scotland that \u201cfound evidence pointing to a correlation between social deprivation and incidence of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptors.\u201d In addition, he cites the insight of his friend Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute: \u201cPoverty is a carcinogen.\u201d\n\nGiven the mortality discrepancies, it is disturbing that African-Americans are underrepresented as subjects in cancer research, as are other minorities.

(pop. 12,000), to big cities like Dallas and Tucson, folkl\u00f3rico is increasingly being embraced by schools as part of performing arts or physical education curriculums. Maria Luisa Colmenarez, president of the nonprofit Danzantes Unidos, a transnational network of dancers, said it is \u201ca declaration that the students are part of the fabric that makes America America.\u201d\n\nIn Grand Prairie, Tex., a town between Dallas and Fort Worth, recruiters from University of Texas of the Permian Basin scout gifted young folkloristas the way their colleagues check out football prospects. In the Dallas Independent School District, folkl\u00f3rico \u201cis on the same plane as ballet and modern,\u201d said Rachel Harrah, the district\u2019s theater and dance director, offered at 19 high schools, 23 middle and two elementary schools, with master classes held four times a year.\n\nJos\u00e9 Tena, a revered dancer and teacher in Las Cruces, N.M., about 45 miles from the border, put it this way: \u201cThe purpose is not to create professional dancers, but to create members of the community who value who they are.\u201d\n\nImage Dancers from Central High in Fresno.

Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times\n\nAs the students from Monache High stepped onstage in Fresno \u2014 the boys in suede over-pants and red kerchiefs, the girls in skirts that become kaleidoscopic swoops of color in motion \u2014 they began \u201cEl Sapo\u201d (\u201cThe Toad\u201d), exchanging side-to-side hops to a marimba beat. As they danced they also stepped into a tradition in which every bandanna, costume, hair ornament, sash, fan, shawl and pair of boots reflects a specific region of Mexico.\n\nMovement and music are vivid partners in folkl\u00f3rico, in which dancers create intricate, energetic patterns onstage that shift and change with lightning speed. The choreography incorporates traditional steps like lazada, which mimics the roping techniques of vaqueros; or, as in Nayarit and other coastal states, aggressive footwork in which men show off their bravado by dancing with machetes, used to harvest sugar cane. Other steps imitate birds, iguanas and snakes, which are walloped with sombreros. Dances from Jalisco, real crowd pleasers, feature dizzying skirt work, in which twirling double layers in riotous colors become presences in their own right.\n\nFlirtation, romance and jostling for a plum partner are prime themes, which makes folkl\u00f3rico a good fit for adolescent dancers. \u201cFolkl\u00f3rico has grown in my heart,\u201d said Michael Herrera, a senior at Lincoln High School in San Jose. \u201cFalling in love, chasing after a girl \u2014 for me, that\u2019s kind of how it is.\u201d\n\nFolkl\u00f3rico rose to national prominence in Mexico during the post-Revolutionary period of the 1920s, when several government agencies and institutions began documenting it. The idea was to preserve the dances as living symbols of national diversity, including in public schools, said Olga N\u00e1jera-Ramirez, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nIn the United States, the Chicano movement of the late-1960s embraced folkl\u00f3rico as a way to promote Mexican identity and push back against cultural assimilation and discrimination. It was then that it gained a toehold at public schools and universities.\n\nImage The team from Fresno High, posing for a picture before performing.

Credit Photographs by Emily Berl for The New York Times\n\nThe appeal of folkl\u00f3rico cuts across cultures. Dancers at Fresno\u2019s Central High, for example, have included Hmong, Russian and Punjabi students. Sumith Goyal, a senior whose father is Indian and mother Cambodian, is the Central group\u2019s vice president. But for students with Mexican roots it resonates most deeply. The Central High troupe, for example, is called Danzantes de Tlaloc, after the Aztec God of rain \u2014 \u201cbecause dance is the water that nourishes the culture,\u201d Rosa A. Gonzalez Madrigal, the group\u2019s director, said.\n\nFor many students, folkl\u00f3rico is an anchor and a source of resilience. Porterville and environs made international news when its wells went dry during California\u2019s five-year drought. Among the families affected was Ms. Ferrer\u2019s; for nearly a year, they showered at relatives\u2019 houses and Ms. Ferrer sometimes resorted to pouring a jug of bottled water over her head. \u201cIt took a toll on us,\u201d she said. \u201cDance was a relief.\u201d\n\nMany of the parents work several jobs to get by, as Mr. Gonzales\u2019s mother did, and some students miss weekend rehearsals to work in the fields, supplementing family income. The cost of costumes \u2014 which can run up to $300 \u2014 and special shoes can be prohibitive. Fund-raisers have become folkl\u00f3rico fixtures, with troupes performing at church fiestas, weddings and even casinos to raise money for stock costumes, and parents selling tamales and T-shirts outside packed auditoriums.\n\nSometimes teachers pick up the slack. Among them is Gustavo Sandoval, a science teacher in Thermal, Calif., where 90 percent of high school students live in poverty, many in ramshackle mobile home parks. Mr. Sandoval and his wife, Gabriela, who works in a school kitchen, subsidize an after-school folkl\u00f3rico program at Desert Mirage High School out of their own pockets \u2014 about $11,000 a year. \u201cWe want to give our youth something positive to do,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Porterville, Mr. Gonzales \u201cmade a decision to give it my all,\u201d he said, by using his own seed money to jump-start the program 15 years ago. His sister, Irma Rios, continues to sew many of the costumes.\n\nThe principal of Porterville High, Jose Valdez, said that when he\u2019s having a bad day he wanders into Mr. Gonzales\u2019s rehearsals, where the effervescence and joy lifts his spirits. \u201cIt gives the students a reason to come to school,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all in. They perfect their dances for him,\u201d he said of Mr. Gonzales, \u201cbecause they see and feel his love for what he does.\u201d\n\nAt the Show Offs, a group of female folkloristas from Porterville performed \u201cLa Bruja\u201d(\u201cThe Witch\u201d), a dance from Veracruz in which women in gossamer white dresses emerge onstage, a glass containing a lit candle balanced atop each of their heads.\n\nThe ethereal glow suggested the transformative power of folkl\u00f3rico.

{"title": "\n                    A Curveball From the New Tax Law: It Makes Baseball Trades Harder                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/baseball-tax-law-.html", "text": "The provision is raising concerns and questions across Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, starting with: How do you value a player?\n\n\u201cThere is no fair-market value of a baseball player. There isn\u2019t,\u201d said Daniel R. Halem, the chief legal officer of Major League Baseball. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what our clubs are going to do to address the issue. We haven\u2019t fully figured it out yet. This is a change we hope was inadvertent, and we\u2019re going to lobby hard to get it corrected.\u201d\n\nThe N.B.A. is similarly perplexed. It sent teams an email this month detailing the disruption of the trading system under the new law, but told executives it was still figuring out how to respond.\n\nThe confusion is only one of many side effects of the new tax law, which sped through the House and Senate in less than two months at the end of last year, resulting in a series of changes that were both intentional and inadvertent. Republicans say they weren\u2019t trying to hamstring sports teams: The change in the like-kind provision, Senate staff members said, was simply an attempt to broaden the United States tax base.\n\nBut that is little consolation to the teams who now join restaurateurs, independent agriculture businesses and multinational corporations on a long list of entities affected by the law in ways they did not see coming, and who now face long odds to secure changes or clarifications.\n\nMajor League Baseball and N.B.A. officials expressed hope that Congress would revisit the provision, which is one of many parts of the law that could raise their taxes or hurt their revenues.\n\nIt is unclear how aggressively the Internal Revenue Service would enforce the provision with sports teams. Mr. Halem, of Major League Baseball, said the league was asking the Treasury Department for guidance on how to come up with valuations for tax purposes. If such a system was the intended result of the law, he said, \u201cthen write some regulations, tell us what you mean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI.R.S. officials declined to comment on whether the agency would issue future rulings on the tax treatment of sports trades. Treasury officials did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike many franchises, the Astros have aggressively worked the baseball trade market to improve their roster. Last year, on their way to their first World Series championship, they engineered a last-minute deal ahead of the league\u2019s trade deadline to acquire Justin Verlander, a veteran starting pitcher midway through a six-year, $162 million contract, from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for three up-and-coming young players. Last month, the Astros acquired the veteran pitcher Gerrit Cole from the Pittsburgh Pirates in a similar trade.\n\nFor decades, teams have not paid taxes on such trades, and thus have not had to account for the value of the assets they are exchanging, for tax purposes. A 1967 ruling from the Internal Revenue Service allowed baseball owners to depreciate the cost of player contracts over several years, thus reducing the team\u2019s taxable income. It declared that \u201ctrades of player contracts owned by major league baseball clubs will be considered exchanges of like-kind property\u201d under a section of the tax code.\n\nThat distinction was crucial. Until this year, the \u201clike-kind\u201d provision allowed owners of similar types of property, such as machinery or fleet vehicles, to swap their assets without paying taxes on either party\u2019s gains until the asset was sold. In a baseball or basketball trade, the assets aren\u2019t players, they are the players\u2019 contracts \u2014 and the I.R.S. was allowing them to be exchanged without fear of taxation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe new law breaks that peace, by limiting like-kind exchanges to \u201creal property,\u201d which is shorthand for land or other real estate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that they thought about baseball when they thought about this change,\u201d said Kari Smoker, an accounting professor at SUNY Brockport who has consulted for the N.B.A. and National Hockey League players\u2019 associations in legislative disputes over sports taxation. \u201cIt raises all kinds of issues, which I think were easier to ignore, probably, when we had a simple rule that it was a like-kind exchange.\u201d\n\nMr. Verlander, for example, was clearly a more immediately valuable asset to the Astros than the three prospects they traded to get him. He gave up only four runs in his five regular-season starts for the team, then won four straight starts to begin the playoffs. In very simple terms, he brought value to the Astros in a trade, and had the new law been in place last year, the team would have owed taxes on that added value.\n\nBut what, exactly, was that value? Was it the size of his contract? Mr. Verlander earned $28 million last year, while the players traded for him drew minor league salaries. Was it the additional wins he brought to the team? Statisticians estimate Mr. Verlander gave the Astros nearly two more wins last season, a value that, depending on the statistician, could reach $20 million. Or was it some calculation of the total future value Mr. Verlander will bring to the team, minus the total future value it gave up in the prospects it traded away \u2014 and possibly adjusted for the amount the team will have to pay Mr. Verlander?\n\nComplicating matters further is that teams value players differently, and one player might help a certain team far more than another team. A struggling club with a surplus of starting pitchers might trade one to a playoff contender in desperate need of one, in exchange for position players who could improve a struggling lineup. In that case, both teams could, reasonably, be considered to have gained value in the trade, and thus would owe taxes on it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is exactly how Adam Guttridge views the trade of Mr. Verlander \u2014 as a win-win for both the Astros and Tigers, which would have resulted in a capital-gains tax bill for each of them. Mr. Guttridge is a former manager of baseball research and development for the Milwaukee Brewers and a co-founder of NEIFI, a consultancy that has developed software to attach a dollar value to every professional ballplayer and his expected future performance.\n\nHow to calculate such value for tax purposes \u201cis the question that somebody has to answer, that nobody in the baseball space has,\u201d Mr. Guttridge said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly no consensus among the 30 teams.\u201d\n\nSeveral baseball executives declined to comment on the change and how it could affect their willingness to trade players in the future, including the general manager of the Astros, Jeff Luhnow.\n\nBasketball could be an even trickier proposition, because it taxes teams if they exceed a certain amount of total player salary for the season. This year, the Portland Trail Blazers traded a player with a modest contract in order to get under the tax threshold, saving themselves millions. The Cleveland Cavaliers made a series of trades that pushed them over the threshold. Some N.B.A. executives \u2014 who would not speak for publication \u2014 wondered if the Trail Blazers would need to pay federal tax on the money they avoided in league taxes as a result of a trade.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, did not return a request for comment on whether he would be inclined to support a bill to change the law for sports teams. Neither did Mr. Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, who reveled in the Astros championship run last year.\n\n\u201cAt my desk,\u201d he posted on Twitter, alongside a picture of himself, on Nov. 1, the day of Game 7 of the World Series, \u201cwearing my #Astros tie, putting final touches on the first bold #TaxReform in 31 years.\u201d", "keywords": ["law", "harder", "tax", "curveball", "teams", "astros", "makes", "mr", "trade", "players", "value", "league", "trades", "baseball"], "polarity": 0.06499281968031968, "subjectivity": 0.3931479978354978},

But they said moving him against his will would require a social worker\u2019s recommendation, plus other legal actions.\n\nWe could not reach his relative by phone, despite multiple attempts.

And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a house he inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans.

He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem.

In a report on digital taxation issued on Friday, which was separate from the European Union proposal, the organization said that more than 110 countries agreed to review the international tax system, parts of which had been rendered obsolete by the digital economy.\n\nOfficials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\n\n\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed.

The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.\n\nAmazon has been the focus of European officials in the past.

European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.\n\nWithin the past few years, the European Commission has ordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes and levied fines against other tech giants for abusing their dominant market positions. In January, European antitrust officials fined Qualcomm, the chip maker, \u20ac997 million for illegally shutting rivals out of the market for certain smartphone and tablet chipsets for more than five years. Qualcomm said it would appeal the ruling.\n\nLast year, the European Commission fined Google \u20ac2.42 billion for using its search engine to favor its own comparison shopping service \u2014 called Google Shopping \u2014 in search results while demoting results of rival services. Google has appealed the ruling.\n\nNow, as the European Union prepares to institute comprehensive new data protection rules in May, European regulators have opened a novel line of attack. They are investigating the tech giants\u2019 vast information-gathering operations as potential anti-competitive abuses.\n\nIn December, Germany\u2019s federal cartel office said Facebook had abused its dominant position by requiring its users to let the social network \u201climitlessly amass\u201d data by tracking them through other online services \u2014 including the Facebook-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. Antitrust regulators said they were \u201cnot convinced that users have given their effective consent\u201d to Facebook\u2019s data practices and that the extent of the data collection violated mandatory European data protection principles.\n\nIn a blog post, Facebook said that it was cooperating with the German agency, but challenged the claim that it had a dominant position, saying that the social network was merely \u201cpopular in Germany.\u201d The company also said it would \u201cbe working directly with relevant data protection officials\u201d to ensure compliance with the upcoming European data regulation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.\n\nThe exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\n\n\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201d\n\nAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.\n\nIn 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.\n\nBut European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.\n\nThere is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.", "keywords": ["europes", "tax", "european", "planned", "digital", "heightens", "companies", "data", "states", "american", "million", "taxes", "tensions", "united"], "polarity": 0.07509460317460316, "subjectivity": 0.30859266955266945},

It urged the justices to turn down the victims\u2019 appeal, saying it did not \u201cwarrant this court\u2019s intervention at this time.\u201d But the brief took no position on whether the plaintiffs\u2019 legal arguments were correct.\n\nThis did not sit well with Theodore B.

To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure.

The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "students", "punished", "national", "quandary", "black", "ms", "york", "guidance", "teachers", "confronts", "minnesota", "discipline", "districts", "school"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785},

Wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, Bannon\u2019s advice is strange. After all, by any normative understanding, \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cxenophobe\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d are negative words from both a moral and rational point of view. Their definitions, taken from any standard dictionary, will bear this out. Racism, xenophobia and nativism embody, in their very meanings, both irrationality and unfairness. Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it. And he recommends presenting such irrationality as virtuous.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The Times identified these cases \u2014 many of which are sealed \u2014 through interviews with lawyers, police officers and current and former judges.\n\n[ALSO READ: He Excelled as a Detective, Until Prosecutors Stopped Believing Him]\n\nIn these cases, officers have lied about the whereabouts of guns, putting them in suspects\u2019 hands or waistbands when they were actually hidden out of sight. They have barged into apartments and conducted searches, only to testify otherwise later. Under oath, they have given firsthand accounts of crimes or arrests that they did not in fact witness. They have falsely claimed to have watched drug deals happen, only to later recant or be shown to have lied.\n\nNo detail, seemingly, is too minor to embellish. \u201cClenched fists\u201d is how one Brooklyn officer described the hands of a man he claimed had angrily approached him and started screaming and yelling \u2014 an encounter that prosecutors later determined never occurred. Another officer, during a Bronx trial, accused a driver of recklessly crossing the double-yellow line \u2014 on a stretch of road that had no double-yellow line.\n\nIn many instances, the motive for lying was readily apparent: to skirt constitutional restrictions against unreasonable searches and stops. In other cases, the falsehoods appear aimed at convicting people \u2014 who may or may not have committed a crime \u2014 with trumped-up evidence.\n\nIn still others, the motive is not easy to discern. In October 2016, for example, a plainclothes Brooklyn officer gave a grand jury a first-person account of a gun arrest. Putting herself in the center of the action, the officer, Dornezia Agard, testified that as she approached a man to confront him for littering, he suddenly crouched behind a van, pulled from his waistband a dark object \u2014 later identified as a gun \u2014 and threw it on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cP.O. Agard testified that she heard a hard metal object hit the ground,\u201d according to a letter the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office wrote summarizing her testimony.\n\nBut prosecutors lost faith in her account in July 2017, after learning from other officers that she was not among the first officers on the scene. Officer Agard had arrived later as backup, according to the letter, which noted that the gun charges against the man were later dismissed. The prosecutors did not address why Officer Agard claimed to be a witness, or why the other officers present seem to have allowed her to process the arrest.\n\nPolice lying raises the likelihood that the innocent end up in jail \u2014 and that as juries and judges come to regard the police as less credible, or as cases are dismissed when the lies are discovered, the guilty will go free. Police falsehoods also impede judges\u2019 efforts to enforce constitutional limits on police searches and seizures.\n\n\u201cWe have 36,000 officers with law enforcement power, and there are a small handful of these cases every year,\u201d said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the Police Department, the nation\u2019s largest municipal force. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any of these cases any less troubling. Our goal is always, always zero. One is too many, but we have taken significant steps to combat this issue.\u201d\n\nShrouded, but Persistent\n\nThe 25 cases identified by The Times are almost certainly only a fraction of those in which officers have come under suspicion for lying in the past three years. That\u2019s because a vast majority of cases end in plea deals before an officer is ever required to take the witness stand in open court, meaning the possibility that an officer lied is seldom aired in public. And in the rare cases when an officer does testify in court \u2014 and a judge finds the testimony suspicious, leading to the dismissal of the case \u2014 the proceedings are often sealed afterward.\n\nStill, the cases identified by The Times reveal an entrenched perjury problem several decades in the making that shows little sign of fading.\n\nSo far in 2018, a Queens detective has been convicted of lying in a drug case and a Brooklyn detective has been arrested amid accusations that he fabricated the results of a photo lineup. These cases returned the phenomenon of police lying to the public eye, leaving police officials to defend the integrity of honest officers.\n\nKevin Richardson, the Police Department\u2019s top internal prosecutor, said he believed so-called testilying was nearing its end. \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s very much largely on its way out,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s tempting to think about police lying as a bygone of past eras: a form of misconduct that ran unchecked as soaring street violence left the police overwhelmed during the 1980s and early 1990s and that re-emerged as police embraced stop-and-frisk tactics and covered up constitutional violations with lies.\n\nBut false testimony by the police persists even as crime has drastically receded across the city and as the Police Department has renounced the excesses of the stop-and-frisk years.\n\nSome policing experts anticipate that the ubiquity of cameras \u2014 whether on cellphones, affixed to buildings or worn by officers \u2014 will greatly reduce police lying. For the moment, however, video seems more capable of exposing lies than vanquishing them.\n\nMemory and Manipulation\n\nIn two recent cases, The Times found, officers appear to have given false accounts about witness identifications. These cases are particularly troubling because erroneous identifications by witnesses have been a leading cause of wrongful convictions.\n\nAfter a 2016 mugging near a Brooklyn subway station, the police arrested a group of four people, one of whom was found to be in possession of the victim\u2019s wallet. In preparing the case, prosecutors sought to pin down a few basic facts. Had the police brought the victim, who was punched and had his wallet taken, to positively identify the four suspects after they were taken into custody? If so, what had the victim said?\n\nGetting a straight answer from the arresting officer, Chedanan Naurang, proved nearly impossible. It had been Officer Naurang\u2019s quick thinking that had made the arrest possible: Having lost the suspects at one subway station, he followed a hunch and drove one stop down the line, where he caught up with the four men after they got off the train.\n\nBut certain details Officer Naurang gave prosecutors kept shifting over the next year, according to a February 2017 letter that prosecutors wrote in which they summarized his fluid story.\n\nOfficer Naurang said at one point that the identification had occurred inside a police station when the victim passed by the holding cells, saw the men and confirmed their involvement in the crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ALSO READ: Two NYPD Officers Are Charged With Lying About Suspect]\n\nA few weeks later, he backtracked. No, the victim had actually never gotten to see the suspects at the police station, Officer Naurang explained. Instead, the victim had gotten a chance to view them on the street, shortly after their arrest. That\u2019s when the victim got out of the police vehicle in which he had been waiting, Officer Naurang said, and pointed to one of the four men, identifying him as an attacker.\n\nThis version of events, however, was at odds with the recollection of the police officer who had driven the victim to the scene of the arrest. That officer, Christopher McDonald, told prosecutors that the victim had remained in the back seat while viewing the four suspects. And Officer McDonald said that the victim couldn\u2019t say whether they were his assailants. He thought he recognized their clothing, but wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nBecause of Officer Naurang\u2019s changing story, prosecutors dropped the case against the men as part of a deal in which all four pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a second mugging they were accused of the same night.", "keywords": ["lying", "stubborn", "later", "suspects", "victim", "testilying", "cases", "officer", "problem", "officers", "times", "naurang", "prosecutors"], "polarity": 0.01095650381364667, "subjectivity": 0.37745734657499336},

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

A parent company is considered a joint employer if it controls their working conditions, although the legal criteria for determining control in this context has shifted in recent years.\n\nA finding that McDonald\u2019s is a joint employer would make the company liable for labor-law violations committed by its franchisees, and would require it to bargain with restaurant workers who unionized.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe workers in the case asserted that their bosses at McDonald\u2019s restaurants had disciplined them, retaliated against them and in some cases fired them for taking part in protests beginning in 2012 in which they demanded a $15 hourly wage and a union.\n\nThe general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, at the time an appointee of President Barack Obama, investigated their charges and issued complaints against McDonald\u2019s and its franchisees in 2014. A trial began in 2015 and continued into this year.\n\nBut in January, the labor board\u2019s new general counsel, appointed by Mr. Trump, was granted a 60-day stay in the case \u2014 which expired Monday \u2014 to pursue settlement talks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Robb, argued that two labor board decisions in December, one of which changed the legal standard for determining joint employment, might have weakened aspects of the case against McDonald\u2019s and made a settlement more likely.\n\nIn his request for a stay, Mr. Robb said a settlement could \u201cfacilitate far more prompt and immediate remedial relief for the employees impacted by the alleged unfair labor practices.\u201d\n\nBefore the December decision by the board, a parent company like McDonald\u2019s could be considered a joint employer if it exerted indirect control over workers at a franchisee, or if it had the right to exercise control over workers that it nonetheless did not exercise.\n\nAfter the board\u2019s decision in December, a company had to have direct and immediate control over workers to be considered a joint employer.\n\nAt the time he sought a stay, labor groups argued that Mr. Robb\u2019s logic was specious because the board\u2019s case against McDonald\u2019s did not hinge on which definition of joint employment applied.\n\nLawyers for the Service Employees International Union argued that even if the general counsel preferred to seek a settlement, it made no sense to stop the trial, which was only days from concluding, in order to do so.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a court filing, they argued that stopping the trial would give McDonald\u2019s an advantage by preventing union lawyers from cross-examining a key witness, and that it fostered \u201ca game of hide-the-ball.\u201d\n\nThen, last month, one of Mr. Robb\u2019s primary arguments for a pause in the trial was upended when the labor board, on a procedural question, reversed its December decision narrowing the definition of a joint employer. At that point, the joint employer definition reverted to what it had been earlier in the trial.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, stated in a March 7 letter that the board\u2019s reversal \u201celiminates whatever support may have existed for your efforts to settle the McDonald\u2019s case so near to the trial\u2019s close.\u201d They urged Mr. Robb to \u201cswiftly resume and finish the trial.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Robb\u2019s office pressed ahead with its efforts to reach a settlement. Last week, lawyers from the labor board\u2019s regional offices abruptly reached out to several former McDonald\u2019s workers involved in the case. In one instance, a labor board lawyer called a worker and asked if she \u201cwas ok with $50k\u201d for back pay as part of the settlement, according to an email between the board and Mr. Wissinger, one of the union lawyers. The offer was conditional on the worker\u2019s waiving her right to be reinstated in her old job.\n\nMr. Wissinger said that the calls created the impression that workers needed to accept the offers before they consulted with him or his colleagues or anyone else, and that at least two did.\n\n\u201cIt was a done deal by the time we found out,\u201d Mr. Wissinger said. \u201cThey were completely cutting us out of the process.\u201d\n\nJennifer Abruzzo, who served as deputy general counsel of the labor board until 2017, said settlement discussions that excluded lawyers who backed the workers were a break with custom.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unusual,\u201d Ms. Abruzzo said. \u201cThe charging party is the one that the regions typically go to. And the charging party in this instance is the S.E.I.U.\u201d", "keywords": ["settle", "employer", "threat", "franchise", "mr", "joint", "push", "model", "settlement", "labor", "workers", "wissinger", "case", "board", "mcdonalds"], "polarity": 0.06610425094031648, "subjectivity": 0.4232683982683981},

That's why I agree with the many others who have called for the appointment of an additional special counsel who, unlike Mueller, has the authority to look into the potential abuses of the FISA system that allowed the Democrat-funded Steele dossier to serve as the basis for the initial F.B.I. investigation.\n\n\u201cThe addition of an outside special counsel will ensure our ability to have full faith in our investigations into the very serious threats Putin's rogue government poses to our elections and nation as a whole.\u201d\n\nHave not commented\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee\n\nSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader\n\nCongressional Intelligence Committees\n\nThe Times reached out to every Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

The president\u2019s boundless benefit of the doubt for the Rob Porters and Roy Moores of the world, combined with off-with-their-heads capriciousness for immigrants accused of even minor crimes, is not a contradiction. It is the expression of a consistent worldview that he campaigned on and has pursued in office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

If a young black man grabs a white woman by the crotch, he\u2019s a thug and deserves to be roughed up by police officers. But if Donald Trump grabs a white woman by the crotch in a nightclub (as he\u2019s accused of doing, and denies), it\u2019s locker-room high jinks.\n\nThis view is also expressed by many of the president\u2019s staff members, supporters and prominent allies. During the same week that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, repeatedly vouched for Rob Porter\u2019s integrity, Mr. Kelly also mused that hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants who did not fill out the paperwork for DACA protections had refused to \u201cget off their asses.\u201d\n\nA political movement that rails against \u201cimmigrant crime\u201d while defending alleged abusers and child molesters is one that has stopped pretending to have any universalist aspirations. The president\u2019s moral framework springs from an American tradition of cultivating fear and contempt among its white citizens against immigrants, indigenous people and people of color, who are placed on the other side of \u201cthe law.\u201d It\u2019s a practice that has taken on new strength at a time when many white people fear they may be outnumbered, outvoted and out of time.\n\nThis is the opposite of what we like to tell ourselves is the traditional American civic creed: one symbolized by a blindfolded Lady Justice who applies the law without fear or favor to whoever may come before her. It is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most insidious victories that he has given his supporters permission to drop any pretense of insisting that their actions and views should conform to this principle.\n\nIf all that matters when it comes to \u201claw and order\u201d is who is a friend and who is an enemy, and if friends are white and enemies are black or Latino or in the wrong party, then the rhetoric around crime and punishment stops being about justice and is merely about power and corruption.\n\nAnd this is what \u201claw and order\u201d means: the preservation of a certain social order, not the rule of law. It shouldn\u2019t have taken this long to see what has always been staring us in the face. After all, the last president to focus so intensely on law and order, Richard Nixon, the man who helped usher in mass incarceration, was also the most infamous criminal to occupy the Oval Office. The history of the United States is the story of a struggle between the desire to establish certain universal rights and the countervailing desire to preserve a particular social order.\n\nWe are now witnessing a president who wholly embraces the latter. America can have that kind of social order, or it can have justice for all. But it can\u2019t have both.", "keywords": ["white", "law", "view", "order", "chris", "mr", "means", "trump", "sign", "presidents", "crime", "justice", "social", "hayes"], "polarity": 0.060737133237133235, "subjectivity": 0.3308874458874459},
{"title": "\n                    Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html", "text": "\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe division within Google spilled into the open last year when James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a memo critical of its diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSome Google employees who are diversity advocates said management had not taken action against people who tried to bait them into making angry statements.\n\nLast month, Tim Chevalier, who had worked at Google as an engineer until November, sued for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired \u201cbecause of his political statements in opposition to the discrimination, harassment and white supremacy he saw being expressed on Google\u2019s internal messaging systems.\u201d He said one employee had suggested that there was a shortage of black and Latino employees at Google because they were \u201cnot as good.\u201d\n\nMr. Chevalier said he had been fired shortly after saying that Republicans were \u201cwelcome to leave\u201d if they did not feel comfortable with Google\u2019s policies. He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["internal", "hard", "lawsuit", "mr", "diversity", "work", "employees", "damore", "trying", "googles", "fired", "diversify", "google"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Stone Jr., one of the president\u2019s oldest confidantes.\n\nProjecting strength, control and power, whether as a New York developer or domineering reality television host, has always been vital to Mr. Trump. But in his first year in the White House, according to his friends, he found himself feeling tentative and anxious, intimidated by the role of president, a fact that he never openly admitted but that they could sense, people close to the president said.\n\nThis, after all, is someone for whom leaving the security of Trump Tower and moving to Washington and the White House was a daunting prospect. Even now, as he has grown more comfortable in the job, he rarely leaves the White House unless he is certain the environment will be friendly, such as at one of his own properties. Rallies are rarely scheduled in areas that could invite large protests.\n\nFor months, aides were mostly able to redirect a neophyte president with warnings about the consequences of his actions, and mostly control his public behavior.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose most able to influence him were John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general turned chief of staff, and Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and director of the National Economic Council. And few people had more ability to blunt the president\u2019s potentially self-destructive impulses than Hope Hicks, his communications director, who has been one of his closest advisers since the earliest days of his 2016 campaign.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have said that Mr. Trump was trapped in a West Wing cage built by Mr. Kelly, and has finally broken loose.\n\nThe reality is more complicated, his closest aides say. They say Mr. Trump now feels he doesn\u2019t need the expertise of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Cohn or Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil executive he made secretary of state. If he once suspected they were smarter or better equipped to lead the country and protect his presidency, he doesn\u2019t believe that now.\n\nTwo of those men are now on their way out. And Mr. Trump has an ambiguous relationship with the third, Mr. Kelly, whom he alternately assures that his job is secure and disparages to other people. Ms. Hicks is leaving the White House in the coming days, a departure that has caused concern among his allies about how he will cope without her in the long term.\n\nOutside the White House, there are few friends the president will listen to. Some of them warned him to back off his tariffs plan, telling him that he would undo what he had accomplished with the tax bill. Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t agree, and that was that.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Contrary to descriptions of a constantly fuming, beleaguered president, friends and advisers say Mr. Trump is more at ease than he has been in some time. What seems like unchecked chaos to almost everyone else is Mr. Trump feeling he is in his element.\n\n\u201cHe seems more relaxed, believe it or not,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who spent several hours with the president during two St. Patrick\u2019s Day events on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a combination of being more relaxed and also being frustrated by the fact that he feels like a lot of what he didn\u2019t succeed at, or what hasn\u2019t worked, is that he wasn\u2019t allowed to be Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nHis close allies, like Representative Mark Meadows, the North Carolina Republican who is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, believe the president is finding his stride and learning how to navigate Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI see it more as a function of just, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve taken a year to understand the different dynamics within a broad array of personalities,\u2019 and so now it\u2019s all about putting together a team to go the distance for the next three years,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nWarnings of dire consequences from his critics have failed to materialize. When Mr. Cohn announced that he was resigning, the predictions were that the stock market would plummet. There was only a minor dip by the end of the next day.\n\nAnd on North Korea, even the grayest of foreign policy beards have conceded that Mr. Trump might be able to accomplish something.\n\n\u201cThe president has his own original style, and it\u2019s unlikely to be changed at this stage of his life,\u201d Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, said in an interview. \u201cBut it also is conducive to bringing forward opportunities like this Korean conversation. It is not what we traditionalists would have recommended in the first place.\n\n\u201cBut I have to say, when I have thought it through, and how it could play out, it could restore a political initiative to us, and could compel a conversation with countries\u201d otherwise disinclined.\n\nSome worried aides are less sanguine. They view the weekend\u2019s attacks on Mr. Mueller and the F.B.I. as a particularly disturbing taste of what they believe could come. They say privately that Mr. Trump does not understand the job the way he believes he does, and that they fear he will become even less inclined to take advice.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether his attacks on Mr. Mueller are anything more than an effort to define the terms of the public conversation about the investigation, and the parameters of an interview with the president that the special counsel is seeking.\n\nBut the possibility that Mr. Trump would be emboldened enough to fire Mr. Mueller was raised on Sunday by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nSuch a move, Mr. Graham said on CNN, would be \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of the Trump presidency.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "mr", "conversation", "aides", "emboldened", "say", "trump", "feels", "york", "house", "kelly", "really", "newly"], "polarity": 0.10543237144799646, "subjectivity": 0.38356803786491295},
{"title": "\n                    Oakland Embraces Marijuana Sales. Compton Bans Them. How Is Justice Best Served?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/california-marijuana-oakland-compton.html", "text": "Several states, including Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are drawing up or have provisions in their marijuana laws to assist communities disproportionately affected by drug interdiction efforts.\n\nIn California, Oakland led the way in framing the legalization as both an opportunity to address past injustice and as a source of revenue. Yet dozens of other cities and towns across the state \u2014 including Bakersfield, Brentwood, Chico, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Mill Valley and Palo Alto \u2014 want nothing to do with recreational marijuana sales.\n\nOnly 14 percent of California\u2019s 482 cities and towns allow retail sales of recreational marijuana, according to Weedmaps, a website that hosts reviews of cannabis businesses. Californians may want access to a marijuana dispensary, just not necessarily down the block from them.\n\nWhen legalization came into effect in California in January, Oakland started a program that offered licenses to those with previous marijuana arrests. The idea, which has been copied in cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, was intended as a sort of redress for the years before legalization when blacks and other nonwhites were arrested at rates that were disproportionate to their share of the population.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs was a very specific war on a very specific community and culture,\u201d said Darlene Flynn, the director of Oakland\u2019s Department of Race and Equity.\n\nOakland\u2019s equity program goes to the heart of a paradox of legal marijuana sales in California: While large numbers of those arrested before legalization were black, most of the cannabis businesses in the post-legalization era are run by white men.\n\nLast year, Oakland produced a report showing that 77 percent of cannabis-related arrests in 2015 were of African-Americans, who make up around 30 percent of the city\u2019s 420,000 residents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of data that demonstrates that white people use and distribute drugs at the same rate as minorities do,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cThere was an extreme tilt with regards to arrests and convictions.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those with marijuana convictions, Oakland\u2019s program is open to people who lived in neighborhoods that had a particularly heavy police presence during the decades of marijuana prohibition.\n\nLike Oakland, Compton has a history of police abuse and high crime rates. In 2012, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department experimented with an aircraft that recorded high-definition images of the city, which allowed it to track everything happening on the streets. The experiment was kept secret from the city\u2019s residents until it was revealed two years later, to much outrage.\n\nBut both cities have had rising fortunes in recent years. Crime has fallen and economic prospects have brightened. The median price of a home in Compton is now $384,000, a 75 percent increase from five years ago, according to Zillow, the real estate data company. The rise has been even more dramatic in Oakland: prices have doubled in five years, to a median of $746,100.\n\nYet when the question of marijuana legalization came to Compton, residents responded with a completely different answer from Oakland.\n\nCivic and church groups in Compton banded together to campaign door-to-door against two ballot measures that would have allowed marijuana dispensaries and other cannabis manufacturing businesses.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working so hard trying to change the image of Compton,\u201d said the Rev. Stanley W. Prince, a leader of the \u201cno\u201d campaign that was victorious in the January vote. \u201cThere is an economy that can be developed without having weed as the main product.\u201d\n\nYoung people in Compton have a much smaller margin of error than people in wealthier places, Mr. Prince said. They could easily be denied jobs or be fired from them because of marijuana use.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are trying to show that it will not work in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late January, a decisive 76 percent of voters in Compton rejected the proposals that would have allowed marijuana businesses.\n\nCompton\u2019s city manager, Cecil W. Rhambo Jr., said the vote underlined the strength of underestimated conservative views on marijuana in the city, which has a population of just under 100,000.\n\nMr. Rhambo said the vote showed that the \u201ccity portrayed in rap videos is different from the values of the older people who live here, the high propensity voters.\u201d\n\nCompton still struggles with violence \u2014 there were 27 murders in 2017. But that is a fraction of the numbers in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nLongtime Compton residents, especially those who live in parts of town with neat rows of ranch houses and citrus trees, emphasize a sense of community and the household names who grew up in the city, among them the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, the actor Kevin Costner, and the former N.F.L. commissioner Pete Rozelle. (The Williams sisters returned to Compton 16 months ago for a ceremony that dedicated a set of municipal tennis courts in their name.)\n\n\u201cIt was just an idyllic place to grow up,\u201d said James Hays, 61, the owner of a medical technology company who moved to Compton as a child in 1961. \u201cYou had nice single-family homes and manicured lawns, clean streets.\u201d\n\nLike many others in the no campaign, Mr. Hays blames the town\u2019s deterioration on drugs, including marijuana.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

On the afternoon of August 2008, a burglar smashed through the window of Mr. McCullough\u2019s home, prompting neighbors to call the police.

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point.

To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses.

That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time.

{"title": "\n                    Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html", "text": "Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.\n\nWhite boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.\n\nMost white boys raised in wealthy families will stay rich or upper middle class as adults, but black boys raised in similarly rich households will not. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in rich families \u2026 Replay \u21ba Adult outcomes reflect household incomes in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEven when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low poverty and good schools.\n\nAccording to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by what is happening among these boys and the men they become. Though black girls and women face deep inequality on many measures, black and white girls from families with comparable earnings attain similar individual incomes as adults.\n\nLarge income gaps persist between men \u2014 but not women. Black men consistently earn less than white men, regardless of whether they\u2019re raised poor or rich. No such income gap exists between black and white women raised in similar households.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought at some point you escape the poverty trap,\u201d said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study.\n\nBlack boys \u2014 even rich black boys \u2014 can seemingly never assume that.\n\nThe study, based on anonymous earnings and demographic data for virtually all Americans now in their late 30s, debunks a number of other widely held hypotheses about income inequality. Gaps persisted even when black and white boys grew up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar education levels and even similar levels of accumulated wealth.\n\nThe disparities that remain also can\u2019t be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. If such inherent differences existed by race, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to explain to me why these putative ability differences aren\u2019t handicapping women,\u201d said David Grusky, a Stanford sociologist who has reviewed the research.\n\nA more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores don\u2019t accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.\n\nIf this inequality can\u2019t be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home \u2014 in surrounding neighborhoods, in the economy and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.\n\n\u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea,\u201d said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nThe authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.\n\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Chetty said, \u201cis that there are essentially no such neighborhoods in America.\u201d\n\nThe few neighborhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low poverty rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets \u2014 including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx \u2014 were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.\n\nShare of children living in low-poverty neighborhoods with many fathers present\n\nShare of children living in high-poverty neighborhoods with few fathers present\n\n\u201cThat is a pathbreaking finding,\u201d said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist whose books have chronicled the economic struggles of black men. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about the direct effects of a boy\u2019s own parents\u2019 marital status. They\u2019re talking about the presence of fathers in a given census tract.\u201d\n\nOther fathers in the community can provide boys with role models and mentors, researchers say, and their presence may indicate other neighborhood factors that benefit families, like lower incarceration rates and better job opportunities.\n\nThe research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans. But the disparities are widest for black boys.\n\nFor poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys will remain poor as adults. White boys raised in poor families fare far better. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in poor families \u2026 Replay \u21ba\n\n\u201cThis crystallizes and puts data behind this thing that we always knew was there because we either felt it ourselves or we\u2019ve seen it over time,\u201d said Will Jawando, 35, who worked in the Obama White House on My Brother\u2019s Keeper, a mentoring initiative for black boys. Even without this data, the people who worked on that project, he said, believed that individual and structural racism targeted black men in ways that required policies devised specifically for them.\n\nMr. Jawando, the son of a Nigerian father and a white mother, grew up poor in Silver Spring, Md. The Washington suburb contains some of the rare neighborhoods where black and white boys appear to do equally well. Mr. Jawando, who identifies as black, is now a married lawyer with three daughters. He is among the black boys who climbed from the bottom to the top.\n\nWill Jawando was raised in a low-income household in Silver Spring, Md. A lawyer and a former Obama White House staffer, he is among the rare black boys who reached the top fifth of the income distribution as an adult. T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nHe was one of the 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 whose lives are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their parents\u2019 incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.\n\nPrevious research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between women, even though women of color face both sexism and racism.\n\nOther studies show that boys, across races, are more sensitive than girls to disadvantages like growing up in poverty or facing discrimination. While black women also face negative effects of racism, black men often experience racial discrimination differently. As early as preschool, they are more likely to be disciplined in school. They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just being black but being male that has been hyper-stereotyped in this negative way, in which we\u2019ve made black men scary, intimidating, with a propensity toward violence,\u201d said Noelle Hurd, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nShe said this racist stereotype particularly hurts black men economically, now that service-sector jobs, requiring interaction with customers, have replaced the manufacturing jobs that previously employed men with less education.\n\nThe new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent \u2014 by millionaires \u2014 were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about $36,000.\n\nThe sons of black families from the top 1 percent had about the same chance of being incarcerated on a given day as the sons of white families earning $36,000. Share of the men incarcerated on April 1, 2010 Includes men who were ages 27 to 32 in 2010.\n\nAt the same time, boys benefit more than girls from adult attention and resources, as do low-income and nonwhite children, a variety of studies have found. Mentors who aren\u2019t children\u2019s parents, but who share those children\u2019s gender and race, serve a particularly important role for black children, Ms. Hurd has found. That helps explain why the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood, even if not in a child\u2019s home, appears to make a difference.\n\nSome of the widest black-white income gaps in this study appear in wealthy communities. This fits with previous research that has shown that the effects of racial discrimination cross class lines. Although all children benefit from growing up in places with higher incomes and more resources, black children do not benefit nearly as much as white children do. Moving black boys to opportunity is no guarantee they can tap into it.\n\n\u201cSimply because you\u2019re in an area that is more affluent, it\u2019s still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality,\u201d said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent black people.\n\nThis dynamic still weighs on Mr. Jawando. He has a good income, multiple degrees and political aspirations \u2014 he is running for county council in Montgomery County, where he grew up. But in his own community, he is careful to dress like a professional.\n\n\u201cI think if I\u2019m putting on a sweatsuit, if I go somewhere, will I be seen as just kind of a hood black guy?\u201d he said. \u201cOr will people recognize me at all?\u201d Those small daily decisions \u2014 to wear a blazer or not \u2014 follow him despite his success. \u201cI don\u2019t think you escape those things,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Findings From the Research\n\nThis study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.\n\nThere\u2019s a large gap in the marriage rates of white and black Americans, even after accounting for income. Percent of the children married in 2015 Includes men and women who were ages 32 to 37 in 2015.\n\nOne reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and women are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income \u2014 not two. For this reason and others, many point to differences in family structure as a primary driver of racial income inequality. If black children don\u2019t have married parents, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.\n\nThis study found, however, that broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they\u2019re raised in homes with the same incomes and the same family structure.\n\nThe income gap exists for black and white boys if they had one parent in the house or two.\n\nAs this chart shows, a black man raised by two parents together in the 90th percentile \u2014 making around $140,000 a year \u2014 earns about the same in adulthood as a white man raised by a single mother making $60,000 alone.\n\nThe high mobility rate for Asian-Americans is partly about immigration. Based on a sample of the children. Few Native Americans have immigrant mothers; their differences in income are not meaningful.\n\nAsian-Americans earn more in adulthood than whites who were raised in families with similar incomes. But that advantage largely disappears when the researchers look only at children whose parents were born in the United States. Non-immigrant Asian-Americans fare about as well in the economy as whites. (The study did not divide immigrant mothers into smaller groups by origin.)\n\nThe worst places for poor white children are almost all better than the best places for poor black children. Average income of white children from poor families Average income of all children from poor families Average income of black children from poor families\n\nIn previous work, some of these same researchers looked at how the prospects for poor children vary depending on where they grow up. The middle map above shows those earlier results: Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, it\u2019s now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.\n\nPoor white children struggle in parts of the Southeast and Appalachia. But they still fare better there than poor black children do in most of America. In effect, the worst places for whites produce outcomes that are about as good as the best places for blacks. These new maps also suggest that part of the reason the Southeast looks bad for all children, in the middle map, is that the region is home to many black children who fare particularly poorly there.\n\nVery few nonwhite Americans started at the very top. Income distribution of the children in the study Excludes those reporting multiple races and those for whom no race was identified.\n\nAfrican-Americans made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution. They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.\n\nThe Real Starting Positions\n\nThe ladder charts so far have shown equal numbers of black and white boys raised by rich or poor families \u2014 what would happen, in other words, if we started with 10,000 boys, and half were black and half white.\n\nIn reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families.

To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "students", "punished", "national", "quandary", "black", "ms", "york", "guidance", "teachers", "confronts", "minnesota", "discipline", "districts", "school"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785},

It often meets at odd hours and in rushed circumstances, exacerbating the partisan sniping. Both as chairwoman and the top member of the minority, Ms. Slaughter found ways to keep things on an even keel.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShe was a force to be reckoned with who always brought her spunk, fire and dynamic leadership to every meeting,\u201d said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, who now leads the panel and jousted with Ms. Slaughter for years. \u201cLouise was a fearless leader, deeply committed to her constituents, and a dear friend.\u201d He added that he would always \u201ccherish our friendship, camaraderie and, of course, her rhubarb pie.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps Ms. Slaughter\u2019s biggest moment in the limelight was during House machinations over the health care bill in 2010. The loss of a crucial 60th vote in the Senate with the death of Edward M. Kennedy had handcuffed House Democrats who had no choice but to pass a Senate bill with some provisions they didn\u2019t like if they wanted to send a bill to the White House. To limit the political pain, Democrats cooked up an approach that would have essentially deemed the bill passed under what is known in Congress as a self-executing rule, allowing Democrats to avoid a direct vote on those objectionable provisions.\n\nThough Republicans had done the same thing in the past, they howled and mocked Ms. Slaughter with catchy phrases such as \u201cSlaughter House Rules.\u201d Democrats eventually came up with another approach, but Republicans continued to complain, leading the plain-spoken Ms. Slaughter to fire back that their convoluted dispute over procedure was just subterfuge.\n\n\u201cIn reality, it\u2019s about blocking much-needed health care reform in this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who oppose the process don\u2019t want any debate or votes on health care itself. They just want to make reform go away.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, one of her top priorities was an ethics measure intended to prevent lawmakers and other federal officials from profiting in the stock market from inside knowledge. This was one instance that cost her some friends in the House. Representative Chris Collins, a Republican from a neighboring New York district, described her to Fox News as a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d after she complained to House ethics watchdogs about his efforts on behalf of a biotech company in which he owned stock.\n\nMs. Slaughter, the oldest member of the House at her death, had been weighing re-election and was being encouraged to run again and perhaps regain her chairmanship should Democrats take back the House. Mr. McGovern said her energy and optimism remained high.\n\n\u201cShe genuinely loved this institution, she loved Congress and she cared deeply about people and policy,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people hang around here and get tired.

Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation\u2019s vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bol\u00edvar, and quadruple-digit inflation.\n\nSenior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.\n\nWhether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government,\u201d said Cynthia J.

Am\u00e9rico Alex Mata Garc\u00eda is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro\u2019s presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.\n\nThe four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.\n\nThe sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.\n\nOne Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.\n\nVenezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could \u201cexpose U.S. persons to legal risk.\u201d\n\nThe executive order, with its explicit ban, is likely to serve as a warning for other countries that have been looking at issuing virtual currencies to work around international sanctions. Russian government officials have discussed creating a so-called crypto ruble for similar purposes, but have not moved ahead with the plan so far.\n\nRisa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela \u2014 the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro\u2019s grandiose claims, she said \u2014 the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic,\u201d Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday\u2019s measures. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,\u201d both in Venezuela and in the United States.", "keywords": ["white", "digital", "mr", "imposes", "venezuelan", "currency", "trump", "venezuelas", "sanctions", "bans", "maduro", "officials", "petro", "house", "venezuela", "united"], "polarity": 0.04665363046044865, "subjectivity": 0.348984774695002},

By 1968, as David Halberstam wrote in a book at the time, \u201cThe easy old coalition between labor and Negroes was no longer so easy; it barely existed. The two were among the American forces most in conflict.\u201d\n\nBut Kennedy waited to enter the race until March 16, 1968, only after the peace candidate Eugene McCarthy had challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson and locked up the support of many young people and highly educated whites, who were pro-civil rights and skeptical of the war. As a result, Kennedy had to try to appeal simultaneously to minority voters and white working-class constituencies who were part of the backlash against racial progress and the peace movement. This was especially true in Kennedy\u2019s first primary state, Indiana, where Gov. George Wallace of Alabama had shocked observers four years earlier by getting strong support from white ethnic precincts when he challenged Johnson for the Democratic nomination.\n\nKennedy sought to build his unlikely coalition in part by running an economically populist campaign that vilified wealthy tax cheats and earned him the enmity of business leaders. \u201cWe have to convince the Negroes and the poor whites that they have common interests,\u201d he told the journalist Jack Newfield.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Kennedy knew that a populist economic message would not get through to working-class whites unless it was accompanied by a respect for their beliefs on issues like crime, welfare and patriotism. Gerard Doherty, one of his aides, recalled speaking to Kennedy: \u201cI said if he was going to win, he has to conduct a campaign for sheriff of Indiana. And he did.\u201d Coupled with strong support for civil rights, Kennedy\u2019s message about punishing looters got through. At one point during the campaign, Richard Nixon remarked to the reporter Theodore White, \u201cDo you know a lot of these people think Bobby is more a law-and-order man than I am!\u201d\n\nKennedy also campaigned on the dignity of work over welfare. In a TV commercial, he declared, \u201cI think welfare is demeaning and destructive of the human being and of his family.\u201d He didn\u2019t blame \u201cwelfare queens\u201d for cheating the system, as Ronald Reagan later would, but said he envisioned a policy of full employment in which a person could say to himself: \u201cI helped build this country. I am a participant in its greatest public venture.\u201d\n\nOn issues of national security, Kennedy took a principled position in opposition to the Vietnam War \u2014 whose very morality he questioned \u2014 but threaded the needle in a way that also made clear to working-class voters that he differed sharply from upper-middle-class white college students who avoided service or even sympathized with the North Vietnamese Communists. At Notre Dame, Kennedy was booed for saying college draft deferments should be abolished. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the unfair advantage while poor people are being drafted,\u201d he said. Remarkably, in Indiana he polled as well among those who favored Johnson\u2019s conduct of the Vietnam War as he did among those who opposed it.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign to woo working-class voters across racial lines worked. The candidate most identified with advancing civil rights did well not only with black and Hispanic voters but also among working-class whites, some of whom had supported Wallace\u2019s segregationist candidacy in 1964.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA half-century later, how could progressives try to rebuild the Bobby Kennedy coalition? Kennedy\u2019s appeal was based in part on being the brother of a revered and martyred president, of course, and the most salient issues were different in 1968 than they are today. But Kennedy stressed fundamental themes that travel across time and transcend specific policy issues.\n\nFirst, to appeal to a sizable number of white working-class voters in 1968, Kennedy did not forfeit his basic principles or change his positions on civil rights, or war and peace \u2014 and neither should progressives today. Ignoring the rights of women, gay people and people of color is both morally wrong and politically stupid if your aspiration is an inclusive populism.\n\nSecond, progressives should fight for economic justice in a manner that is relentless rather than episodic. On the campaign trail, Kennedy consistently hit themes of economic inequality and named the names of wealthy individuals, like the oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, who paid little in taxes. By contrast, in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton de-emphasized economic issues in favor of attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s qualifications, according to research by Democracy Corps and the Roosevelt Institute, and his support among white non-college voters rose considerably. Progressives also need to vigorously punish Wall Street malfeasance. It is difficult to imagine that Kennedy, a tough prosecutor, would have argued, as some members of the Obama administration did, that some companies are \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d\n\nThird, progressives should explicitly signal the inclusion of working-class whites in their vision for change by applying civil rights laws to issues of class inequality, consistent with Kennedy\u2019s view that \u201cpoverty is closer to the root of the problem than color.\u201d I have long argued that we should extend the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against workers of all races engaged in labor organizing; integrate elementary and secondary schools not only by race but also by socioeconomic status; combat discrimination in housing by economic status as well as race; and adopt affirmative action programs in higher education for economically disadvantaged students of every color.\n\nFourth, progressives could adopt policies that respect the values of working-class people under the banner of patriotic populism, as Kennedy did. They should unapologetically champion a strong American identity around the shared values espoused in the Declaration of Independence as an antidote to exclusionary white nationalism.\n\nAn inclusive patriotic populism would be much more racially tolerant than Mr. Trump\u2019s white nationalism, and it would be tougher on national and domestic security than the populism offered by Mr. Sanders. If Robert Kennedy, the civil rights champion, could attract Wallace voters at a time of national chaos, surely the right progressive candidate with the right message could bring a significant portion of the Obama-Trump voters back home. Doing so would not only bring electoral success but also make it easier to forge a more economically progressive public policy to address America\u2019s dangerous economic divide.", "keywords": ["white", "war", "whites", "kennedy", "voters", "bobby", "economic", "civil", "workingclass", "progressives", "pathway", "rights"], "polarity": 0.1222115912602638, "subjectivity": 0.4557301204203861},

The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.\n\nDr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHe ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data harvesting.

The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.\n\nMr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell \u2014 it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.\n\nSCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.\n\n[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]\n\nBut in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\u201cMany of our clients don\u2019t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,\u201d he told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. \u201cWe can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There\u2019s so many options we can look at.\u201d\n\nThe Channel 4 reporter posed as a \u201cfixer\u201d for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put \u201cinto the bloodstream to the internet,\u201d said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.\n\n\u201cThen watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has to happen without anyone thinking, \u2018That\u2019s propaganda.\u2019 Because the moment you think \u2018that\u2019s propaganda,\u2019 the next question is, \u2018Who\u2019s put that out?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix\u2019s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.\n\nAt a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.\n\n\u201cI mean, deep digging is interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true, and make sure that that\u2019s video-recorded, you know.

Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbull \u201chumored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThey left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,\u201d the company said.\n\nFor Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain\u2019s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.\n\nBut following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,\u201d Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.\n\nElizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook said that it had \u201chired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did.\n\n\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. \u201cAre they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.\u201d\n\nMr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company\u2019s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee.

{"title": "\n                    Hijab Removal by New York Police Prompts Lawsuit                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/nyregion/hijab-police-lawsuit-new-york.html", "text": "Being forced to have their photographs taken without headwear violates their sense of privacy, \u201ctheir sense of dignity, and their sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d said Albert Fox Cahn, legal director of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and a lawyer representing the women in the federal suit.\n\nIn addition to seeking damages for those affected by the photograph policy, the lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting the Police Department from following that policy.\n\nThat those photographs can be retrieved from governmental computer systems and viewed repeatedly as part of a paper court file causes \u201cmultiple iterations of the trauma,\u201d said Mr. Cahn.\n\nA spokesman for the city\u2019s Law Department, Nicholas Paolucci, said, \u201cWe will review the complaint, but we are confident that the police department\u2019s religious head covering policy passes constitutional muster. It carefully balances the department\u2019s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos. Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.\u201d\n\nMs. Clark and Ms. Aziz, like many Muslims, observe their faith by keeping their head and hair covered in the presence of anyone but family. They are joined in the suit by Turning Point for Women and Families, a nonprofit based in Queens concerned about the impact of police policies on victims of domestic violence who wind up arrested.\n\nMr. Cahn and lawyers from the firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, who represent the plaintiffs, contend that the police practices are unreasonable and violate the plaintiffs\u2019 religious freedom under both the First Amendment and federal law.\n\nThe issue highlights the gulf between criminal justice policy, as it has evolved over time, and the cultural and religious obligations of those in custody. As it stands now, the city\u2019s policy explicitly says \u201cthe arrestee\u2019s head covering must be removed\u201d for the department\u2019s official photograph. (A separate photograph that is not considered official, and is sometimes snapped in a station house, can be taken with an arrestee wearing a religious head covering.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Yet critics say the policy is confounding.\n\nFor one, it only deals with the treatment of civilians in those brief moments when their photographs are being snapped. The accommodations the policy calls for are not consistently practiced, critics say. And when they are, they are often conveyed as a warning by officers who tell arrestees that asking for a private photograph could lengthen the arrest processing time and lead to longer detention, said Mr. Cahn. He said Ms. Aziz took such warnings as a threat.\n\nEven more significantly, Mr. Cahn said, the photograph policy does not address the fact that photos exist, possibly to be cataloged and disseminated in the future.\n\n\u201cEach time someone sees a photo of them uncovered, it feels like a new betrayal of their fundamental rights,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, when the city last month settled three separate cases brought by Muslims who said that removing their hijabs for photos violated their religious rights, it had the effect of papering over important nuances in the department\u2019s ongoing treatment of arrestees while staying silent on whether the policy would be altered. The city gave $60,000 to each woman, but said only that doing so was \u201cin the best interest\u201d of all sides without elaborating.\n\nAlso, the settlements are \u201climited to only those people who have already come forward,\u201d said O. Andrew F. Wilson, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cAnd it does nothing to help those women and men who are forced to remove head coverings in the future, or even in the past who haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cahn added that for New Yorkers of different religions, the undercutting of their faith values offers government only slight benefit since many law enforcement experts believe that effective identification is not reliant on the removal of head coverings.\n\nFor driver\u2019s licenses issued in New York, those sitting for a photo can wear hats, scarves or head coverings as long as their entire face is visible and the covering does not cast a shadow. Likewise, the State Police in New York are unaware of any case where a state trooper made an arrestee remove a hijab if their face was visible, said officials of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration.\n\nFederally, the State Department has no requirement that such religious headwear be removed for passport photos. Several police departments around the country, too, see the removal of religious headwear as unnecessary.\n\nThe lawsuit says the city\u2019s policy only \u201calienates and oppresses faith communities.\u201d In interviews, Ms. Clark and Ms. Aziz said their encounters with officers had eroded their trust in the police.\n\nRobina Niaz, the executive director of Turning Point for Women and Families, said fear among Muslim women of the police was deterring them from stepping forward to report episodes of child abuse and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s post-9/11 climate, New York City is beset with widespread hostility toward and baseless fear of Muslim-Americans,\u201d the suit says. \u201cIn the context of this increasingly polarized setting, it is incumbent on this city\u2019s law enforcement to increase awareness of and sensitivity toward the Muslim-American community.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Aziz, a daughter of Palestinian immigrants who is married and has two adult children, her encounter with police has fed residual pain. \u201cI just felt like I was broken,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broke me.\u201d", "keywords": ["lawsuit", "removal", "prompts", "departments", "head", "women", "taken", "york", "religious", "ms", "cahn", "photograph", "hijab", "policy"], "polarity": 0.07382182211727667, "subjectivity": 0.3865173652105469},

He brought a series of people to the podium, including an ICE agent and parents whose eldest son died of a fentanyl overdose, to tell their stories.\n\nThe plan the president described, which was based on recommendations by an opioid commission the president appointed last year, has the goal of reducing the supply of illicit drugs with better interdiction and tougher penalties, reducing opioid prescriptions and overall demand for opioids, and expanding access to treatment and recovery tools like the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.\n\nThe plan seeks to cut the number of opioid prescriptions filled by a third within three years, a restriction that will face opposition from critics who argue it could have unintended consequences for people with chronic and even acute pain, and that it instead could force some users to seek more dangerous drugs, like heroin and synthetic fentanyl.\n\nOfficials were vague about how the prescriptions would be reduced, saying only that a main goal would be for prescribers for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs to follow guidelines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published two years ago. Those guidelines recommended that doctors first try ibuprofen and aspirin to treat pain, and that opioid treatment for short-term pain last no more than a week.\n\nThe plan says little about how addiction treatment would be expanded besides a vague goal of expanding access to \u201cevidence-based addiction treatment\u201d in every state, particularly for members of the military, for veterans and their families and for people leaving jail or prison.\n\nDrug overdoses killed roughly 64,000 people in the United States in 2016, according to initial estimates from the C.D.C., and have become the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he did not put a specific price tag on the plan\u2019s cost. Congress recently allotted $6 billion to address the epidemic over the next two years, which public health experts have described as a good start but not anywhere near enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president also called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid to cover much of the addiction treatment provided around the United States over the past few years.\n\nIn his State of the State address last month, Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican who was on hand for the president\u2019s speech, called the opioid crisis the state\u2019s \u201cmost serious challenge.\u201d\n\nVoters have agreed, with 53 percent saying in a Granite State poll last year that drugs were the biggest problem facing the state \u2014 the first time in the poll\u2019s history that a majority labeled a single issue the most important.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s push for the death penalty for drug traffickers could play well with voters here, as New Hampshire is the only state in New England that still allows capital punishment, though it has not executed anyone since 1939.\n\nIn statements after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, the state\u2019s two Democratic senators \u2014 Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan \u2014 said they generally supported many of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals. Neither senator\u2019s statement directly addressed the president\u2019s call for the death penalty for traffickers, but Ms. Hassan\u2019s aides said that in comments earlier in the day, she had opposed the death penalty for traffickers.\n\n\u201cI think it reflects a lack of a broader understanding of the factors in this crisis,\u201d Ms. Hassan told Fosters.com, a news site. \u201cWe have to go after demand as well as supply, and law enforcement have been the first people to tell us we can\u2019t enforce our way out of this.\u201d\n\nAsked for clarification of her view on Monday, Ms. Shaheen \u2014 who, when she was governor of New Hampshire in 2000, vetoed a bill that would have repealed the state\u2019s death penalty \u2014 said through her spokeswoman: \u201cFrankly, whether a drug dealer, after exhausting all of their legal appeals, gets the death penalty 20 years from now has no impact on our immediate crisis.\u201d\n\nShe said Mr. Trump should be providing more money for the police, emergency medical workers and families in need of treatment.\n\nCivil liberties lawyers were highly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of the death penalty for traffickers and said it would be unworkable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere has never been an execution under the one part of United States law that allows the death penalty as a punishment for traffickers,\u201d said Ames Grawert, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York. \u201cThe Supreme Court has consistently refused to sanction the use of the death penalty in crimes other than homicide.\u201d", "keywords": ["details", "unveiling", "state", "plan", "opioids", "offers", "mr", "tough", "combat", "trumps", "trump", "states", "treatment", "talk", "death", "opioid", "traffickers", "penalty"], "polarity": 0.06140849282296653, "subjectivity": 0.3570915926179083},

But many later left their designated homes, gravitating to areas that already had a high concentration of migrants.\n\nEssen, a city of 600,000 people, has seen its Syrian community grow to nearly 11,000 from 1,300 in 2015, said Peter Renzel, who is in charge of social policy at City Hall.

Some have banned young men from signing up \u2014 in theory not to target migrants, but in practice exactly that.\n\nSitting in his crammed office in Essen one recent morning, arms defiantly crossed over his substantial belly, Mr. Sartor scoffed. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not saying it.\u201d\n\nA former coal worker who retired early when his mine shut down, Mr. Sartor has run the food bank for 12 years as a volunteer.\n\nHe has deliberately left the Nazi graffiti on the door and on the charity\u2019s seven delivery vans, which have also been defaced. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil three years ago, roughly one in three food bank users were foreigners, he said. By last November, it was three in four.\n\nPhoto\n\nFood bank users normally sign up for a year\u2019s pass, after demonstrating proof of need. It was Mr. Sartor\u2019s idea to block any more non-Germans from signing up, at least temporarily. The food bank continues to serve those foreigners already on its lists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen a message about the new policy went up on the food bank\u2019s website on Dec. 8, no one complained. It was only when the local newspaper wrote about it last month that the decision suddenly exploded into the national news.\n\nGiven the controversy, representatives from the food bank, the city and migrant groups met over the weekend and agreed that the ban would be lifted \u201cas soon as possible\u201d \u2014 but only after the numbers of migrants and native Germans evened out.\n\nFor now, the share of foreigners among food bank users is still 60 percent, Mr. Sartor said.\n\nOne of his 120 fellow volunteers resigned in protest over the decision. But those handing out bread, fish, vegetables and fruit on a recent afternoon said that something had to be done.\n\nOne of them, Steffi Tamm, had just gotten off the phone with an older woman who was inquiring whether it was \u201csafe\u201d to come back to the food bank. \u201cHave those young men gone?\u201d she asked.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome of the threat, said Ms. Tamm, is more perceived than real.

The charity has grown to 60,000 volunteers and serves 1.5 million people across Germany. Many of them have experienced similar tensions.\n\nSabine Werth, who now runs the Berlin subsidiary, founded the network in 1993, when a wave of homelessness swept across her city. \u201cOne of our founding principles is that we serve according to need, not origin,\u201d said Ms. Werth, 61.\n\nWhat Mr. Sartor has done, she said, amounts to \u201cGermany First.\u201d\n\nBut Germany First is popular with many, as Ms. Werth has learned the hard way in recent days. \u201cCockroach,\u201d \u201cpiece of dirt\u201d and \u201cforeigner\u2019s slut\u201d are some of the insults that have landed in her inbox.

Last year, Australia agreed to pay $53 million in damages to migrants who said they had suffered abuse in the camps.\n\nMr. Dutton has been a staunch defender of the offshore detention policy, and he has argued that Australia should not accept refugees who would be a burden on the country\u2019s social safety net.\n\nIn January, Mr. Dutton blamed African migrants for a rise in crime in Melbourne, claiming in an interview that residents of the city were afraid even to go to restaurants at night \u201cbecause they\u2019re followed home by these gangs.\u201d\n\nCritics of the government said that those remarks were intended to scare voters before an election and that official crime data showed no such correlation with immigration.\n\nAccording to government statistics, more immigrants to Australia are born in South Africa than in any other African country. As of 2016, 181,400 Australian residents were South African natives, according to the latest census.

The story at the heart of the case was published in The Wall Street Journal in October 2016, just days before the election as the F.B.I. raced to review newly discovered emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server. The Journal revealed a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to handle a separate Clinton investigation, one into her family\u2019s foundation.\n\nMr. McCabe authorized an F.B.I. spokesman and lawyer to speak to The Journal to rebut suggestions that he had put the brakes on the investigation. These types of interactions between journalists and government officials \u2014 known as \u201cbackground calls\u201d \u2014 are common in all federal agencies and administrations as officials try to correct inaccuracies or provide details and nuance before reporters publish information.\n\nThe Journal ultimately reported that while Justice Department officials did not authorize subpoenas, the F.B.I. in fact had pressed ahead with the case \u2014 a detail that if anything was damaging to Mrs. Clinton, not Mr. Trump.\n\nDid the White House Fire Mr. McCabe?\n\nNo. As a career civil servant, Mr. McCabe is not a political appointee who can be summarily dismissed by the president. But this is where the situation gets complicated. Mr. Trump has repeatedly used his Twitter account to attack Mr. McCabe. Months before the firing, he taunted Mr. McCabe about his pension.\n\nAnd he goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against Mr. McCabe.\n\nOn the eve of Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called him a \u201cbad actor.\u201d Taken together, this unusual level of White House commentary created a political backdrop to what should have been an independent government personnel decision. Mr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers seized on that as evidence of improper influence.\n\n\u201cThis distortion of the process begins at the very top, with the president\u2019s repeated offensive, drive-by Twitter attacks on Mr. McCabe.\u201d \u2014 Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer for Mr. McCabe\n\nWhy Was He Fired So Quickly?\n\nThat is one of the big unknowns. F.B.I. disciplinary matters can drag out for extended periods, and it is not uncommon for officials to retire during that process. That did not happen here, and it is not clear why. The workings of the F.B.I.\u2019s disciplinary office are kept confidential.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers say they were given little time to read and respond to the final report and were still receiving new evidence two days before his firing. Why the rush, they ask, if not to make sure that Mr. McCabe was fired?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis concerted effort to accelerate the process, in order to beat the ticking clock of his scheduled retirement, violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,\u201d Mr. Bromwich said.\n\nWhat\u2019s the President\u2019s Beef With Mr. McCabe?\n\nMr. Trump has seized on the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from a political ally of Mrs. Clinton. He says Mr. McCabe never should have been allowed to oversee the Clinton investigation. He says the campaign donations are proof that a pro-Clinton bias within the F.B.I. explains why Mrs. Clinton was never charged.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife on several occasions, including a face-to-face meeting in which the president called her a \u201closer.\u201d\n\nDoes Mr. Trump\u2019s Criticism Have Merit?\n\nYes and no. Mr. McCabe did not begin supervising the Clinton investigation until after his wife had lost the race, and records show that he sought ethics and legal advice inside the F.B.I. before deciding not to recuse himself. But some in the F.B.I. believe he should never have been involved because of his wife\u2019s campaign donations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhen he ultimately recused himself, late in the investigation, it only fueled the argument that he should have stepped aside from the beginning.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s theory of Mr. McCabe as a pro-Clinton partisan, however, is on far shakier ground. Mr. McCabe has identified himself as a lifelong Republican and did not vote in the 2016 election. The newspaper story that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials speak about was not a positive one for Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, in the months before the election, when the F.B.I. publicly disclosed information about its work on the Clinton investigation, it never revealed the existence and scope of a full-throated investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s Russia ties.\n\nWhat Does This Possibly Have to Do with Russia?\n\nLike so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing has become inextricably entangled in presidential politics and the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nMr. McCabe was one of only a handful of F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation from the first days. He supervised it at every step and was involved in the decision to seek a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump foreign adviser. That wiretap application was approved by senior Justice Department officials, was reapproved by Mr. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department and was signed by a federal judge based on evidence that Mr. Page was a Russian agent. Mr. Trump has declared that wiretap to be improper, however, and points to it as evidence of political surveillance by the F.B.I.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McCabe also worked alongside the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who accused Mr. Trump of seeking a loyalty oath and pressing him to end the investigation. Those conversations are now part of an obstruction investigation. Mr. McCabe kept memos on his conversations with Mr. Comey, which could help investigators corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s account.\n\nMr. McCabe argues that the Trump administration is trying to discredit him as a potential witness. The real target, Mr. McCabe said, is Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mr. Trump\u2019s team seemingly gave credence to that argument last weekend when the Daily Beast asked for Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer for a comment on Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing and he responded with a call to end the Mueller investigation.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, if Mr. Trump discredits Mr. McCabe, he can raise questions about everything Mr. McCabe has touched \u2014 including the Russia investigation.

They have followed requests from immigration authorities to hold detainees suspected of being in the country illegally \u2014 another provision in S.B. 4 \u2014 while reassuring anxious and outraged immigrants in their communities.\n\nAfter the ruling on Tuesday, the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, made an unscheduled appearance at a rally by opponents of the law outside City Hall. \u201cIt remains my position that the Houston Police Department is not U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and H.P.D. should not function as an arm of ICE,\u201d Mr. Turner said later in a statement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nSupporters of the law viewed the ruling as a victory, including conservative leaders in other states seeking to pass similar bans on sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Florida tried but failed to pass a bill banning sanctuary cities this legislative session. But the Republican speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran, who has pushed for a crackdown, said the ruling on Tuesday in the Texas case would help their cause.\n\n\u201cThe linchpin of the sanctuary defenders\u2019 argument was that courts would find such legislation unconstitutional,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said in a statement. \u201cWe knew they were wrong, and today the court agreed. Any elected official who thinks they can choose which laws they will and will not follow is sadly mistaken and this ruling reinforces that fundamental American truth.\u201d\n\nIn addition to prohibiting sanctuary policies, S.B. 4 threatens officials who violate the law with fines, jail time and removal from office. The measure was backed by the state\u2019s Republican governor and lieutenant governor, and passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nAustin, Dallas, Houston and other cities and counties sued Texas to block the law, saying it was unconstitutional, opened the door to racial profiling and would make documented and undocumented immigrants fearful of reporting crimes and cooperating with the police.\n\nThe ruling on Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit only complicates the situation. Parts of the law went into effect after a court ruling in September. The Fifth Circuit opinion allows nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions to kick in, although lawyers for the localities and groups suing the state said they were considering appealing the decision to either the full Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite upholding most of the law\u2019s provisions, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision could narrow the effect of the law. The ruling suggested that local officials who limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement because of limited resources were not necessarily violating the law.\n\n\u201cIt is not 100 percent obvious what is allowed and not allowed as far as policymaking,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents San Antonio and other jurisdictions and groups in the lawsuit. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be put into effect in the field.\u201d\n\nThe Fifth Circuit judges struck down one provision of the law \u2014 a clause that had barred officials even from endorsing policies that limit immigration enforcement, which the judges said violated the First Amendment. But some local leaders are concerned that the free speech rights of city employees remain restricted by the law, because the judges lifted the endorsement prohibition only for elected officials and not for nonelected government personnel.\n\nOn Wednesday in San Antonio, some of those dynamics seemed to be at play. Shortly before the start of a news conference held by groups opposed to the law, Councilman Rey Salda\u00f1a wondered whether the city\u2019s police chief, William McManus, would speak at the event. Mr. Salda\u00f1a invited Chief McManus \u2014 who is an appointed official, not an elected one \u2014 but the chief did not attend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m protected according to the Fifth Circuit, because I\u2019m an elected official, but the police chief is not,\u201d Mr. Salda\u00f1a said. \u201cHe works for the city.

According to the 2016-18 report on Cancer Facts and Figures for African-Americans, \u201cdespite lower incidence rates for breast and uterine cancers, black women have death rates for these cancers that are 42 percent and 92 percent higher, respectively, than white women.\u201d Investigators connect the ghastly numbers to the usual socioeconomic discrepancies but also to biological differences in the malignancies of black women.\n\nWith regard to breast cancer, is the mortality gap related to a greater percentage of black women than white women contending with an aggressive form of the disease that lacks estrogen receptors?\n\nDr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, rejects an explanation based on \u201cbiological difference,\u201d pointing instead to dietary disparities.\n\nDisadvantaged Americans consume more calories and carbohydrates, \u201cthe sort of food that is available in poor areas of inner cities,\u201d Dr. Brawley writes in his book \u201cHow We Do Harm.\u201d Greater body weight means African-American girls menstruate earlier and the number of uninterrupted menstrual cycles increases the risk of breast cancer: \u201cThe black-white gap in the onset of menstruation and body weight has dramatically widened, which means that the disease disparities will widen also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Brawley quotes an all-white study in Scotland that \u201cfound evidence pointing to a correlation between social deprivation and incidence of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptors.\u201d In addition, he cites the insight of his friend Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute: \u201cPoverty is a carcinogen.\u201d\n\nGiven the mortality discrepancies, it is disturbing that African-Americans are underrepresented as subjects in cancer research, as are other minorities.

In a makeshift dressing room, girls applied lipstick using their reflective cellphones as mirrors. Boys struggled to wedge their feet into pointy boots.\n\nImage The Fresno High School team preparing for Danzantes del Valle: High School Show Offs.

Here, child poverty rates are high and many workers who spend long days harvesting produce have difficulty putting food on their tables.\n\nImage Dancers from Sunnyside High School in Fresno at Danzantes del Valle.

(pop. 12,000), to big cities like Dallas and Tucson, folkl\u00f3rico is increasingly being embraced by schools as part of performing arts or physical education curriculums. Maria Luisa Colmenarez, president of the nonprofit Danzantes Unidos, a transnational network of dancers, said it is \u201ca declaration that the students are part of the fabric that makes America America.\u201d\n\nIn Grand Prairie, Tex., a town between Dallas and Fort Worth, recruiters from University of Texas of the Permian Basin scout gifted young folkloristas the way their colleagues check out football prospects. In the Dallas Independent School District, folkl\u00f3rico \u201cis on the same plane as ballet and modern,\u201d said Rachel Harrah, the district\u2019s theater and dance director, offered at 19 high schools, 23 middle and two elementary schools, with master classes held four times a year.\n\nJos\u00e9 Tena, a revered dancer and teacher in Las Cruces, N.M., about 45 miles from the border, put it this way: \u201cThe purpose is not to create professional dancers, but to create members of the community who value who they are.\u201d\n\nImage Dancers from Central High in Fresno. Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times\n\nImage The team from the Porterville Unified School District. Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times\n\nAs the students from Monache High stepped onstage in Fresno \u2014 the boys in suede over-pants and red kerchiefs, the girls in skirts that become kaleidoscopic swoops of color in motion \u2014 they began \u201cEl Sapo\u201d (\u201cThe Toad\u201d), exchanging side-to-side hops to a marimba beat. As they danced they also stepped into a tradition in which every bandanna, costume, hair ornament, sash, fan, shawl and pair of boots reflects a specific region of Mexico.\n\nMovement and music are vivid partners in folkl\u00f3rico, in which dancers create intricate, energetic patterns onstage that shift and change with lightning speed. The choreography incorporates traditional steps like lazada, which mimics the roping techniques of vaqueros; or, as in Nayarit and other coastal states, aggressive footwork in which men show off their bravado by dancing with machetes, used to harvest sugar cane. Other steps imitate birds, iguanas and snakes, which are walloped with sombreros. Dances from Jalisco, real crowd pleasers, feature dizzying skirt work, in which twirling double layers in riotous colors become presences in their own right.\n\nFlirtation, romance and jostling for a plum partner are prime themes, which makes folkl\u00f3rico a good fit for adolescent dancers. \u201cFolkl\u00f3rico has grown in my heart,\u201d said Michael Herrera, a senior at Lincoln High School in San Jose. \u201cFalling in love, chasing after a girl \u2014 for me, that\u2019s kind of how it is.\u201d\n\nFolkl\u00f3rico rose to national prominence in Mexico during the post-Revolutionary period of the 1920s, when several government agencies and institutions began documenting it. The idea was to preserve the dances as living symbols of national diversity, including in public schools, said Olga N\u00e1jera-Ramirez, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nIn the United States, the Chicano movement of the late-1960s embraced folkl\u00f3rico as a way to promote Mexican identity and push back against cultural assimilation and discrimination. It was then that it gained a toehold at public schools and universities.\n\nImage The team from Fresno High, posing for a picture before performing.

Credit Photographs by Emily Berl for The New York Times\n\nThe appeal of folkl\u00f3rico cuts across cultures. Dancers at Fresno\u2019s Central High, for example, have included Hmong, Russian and Punjabi students. Sumith Goyal, a senior whose father is Indian and mother Cambodian, is the Central group\u2019s vice president. But for students with Mexican roots it resonates most deeply. The Central High troupe, for example, is called Danzantes de Tlaloc, after the Aztec God of rain \u2014 \u201cbecause dance is the water that nourishes the culture,\u201d Rosa A. Gonzalez Madrigal, the group\u2019s director, said.\n\nFor many students, folkl\u00f3rico is an anchor and a source of resilience. Porterville and environs made international news when its wells went dry during California\u2019s five-year drought. Among the families affected was Ms. Ferrer\u2019s; for nearly a year, they showered at relatives\u2019 houses and Ms. Ferrer sometimes resorted to pouring a jug of bottled water over her head. \u201cIt took a toll on us,\u201d she said. \u201cDance was a relief.\u201d\n\nMany of the parents work several jobs to get by, as Mr. Gonzales\u2019s mother did, and some students miss weekend rehearsals to work in the fields, supplementing family income. The cost of costumes \u2014 which can run up to $300 \u2014 and special shoes can be prohibitive. Fund-raisers have become folkl\u00f3rico fixtures, with troupes performing at church fiestas, weddings and even casinos to raise money for stock costumes, and parents selling tamales and T-shirts outside packed auditoriums.\n\nSometimes teachers pick up the slack. Among them is Gustavo Sandoval, a science teacher in Thermal, Calif., where 90 percent of high school students live in poverty, many in ramshackle mobile home parks. Mr. Sandoval and his wife, Gabriela, who works in a school kitchen, subsidize an after-school folkl\u00f3rico program at Desert Mirage High School out of their own pockets \u2014 about $11,000 a year. \u201cWe want to give our youth something positive to do,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Porterville, Mr. Gonzales \u201cmade a decision to give it my all,\u201d he said, by using his own seed money to jump-start the program 15 years ago. His sister, Irma Rios, continues to sew many of the costumes.\n\nThe principal of Porterville High, Jose Valdez, said that when he\u2019s having a bad day he wanders into Mr. Gonzales\u2019s rehearsals, where the effervescence and joy lifts his spirits. \u201cIt gives the students a reason to come to school,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all in. They perfect their dances for him,\u201d he said of Mr. Gonzales, \u201cbecause they see and feel his love for what he does.\u201d\n\nAt the Show Offs, a group of female folkloristas from Porterville performed \u201cLa Bruja\u201d(\u201cThe Witch\u201d), a dance from Veracruz in which women in gossamer white dresses emerge onstage, a glass containing a lit candle balanced atop each of their heads.\n\nThe ethereal glow suggested the transformative power of folkl\u00f3rico. As Mr. Goyal from Central High, put it: \u201cEven though we stomp really hard, we feel light.\u201d\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page AR 10 of the New York edition with the headline: Folkl\u00f3rico With a Promlike Intensity\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["students", "high", "credit", "danzantes", "promlike", "porterville", "emily", "york", "school", "intensity", "folkl\u00f3rico", "berl"], "polarity": 0.1414810223743648, "subjectivity": 0.41684312064746826},

There isn\u2019t,\u201d said Daniel R. Halem, the chief legal officer of Major League Baseball. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what our clubs are going to do to address the issue. We haven\u2019t fully figured it out yet. This is a change we hope was inadvertent, and we\u2019re going to lobby hard to get it corrected.\u201d\n\nThe N.B.A. is similarly perplexed. It sent teams an email this month detailing the disruption of the trading system under the new law, but told executives it was still figuring out how to respond.\n\nThe confusion is only one of many side effects of the new tax law, which sped through the House and Senate in less than two months at the end of last year, resulting in a series of changes that were both intentional and inadvertent. Republicans say they weren\u2019t trying to hamstring sports teams: The change in the like-kind provision, Senate staff members said, was simply an attempt to broaden the United States tax base.\n\nBut that is little consolation to the teams who now join restaurateurs, independent agriculture businesses and multinational corporations on a long list of entities affected by the law in ways they did not see coming, and who now face long odds to secure changes or clarifications.\n\nMajor League Baseball and N.B.A. officials expressed hope that Congress would revisit the provision, which is one of many parts of the law that could raise their taxes or hurt their revenues.\n\nIt is unclear how aggressively the Internal Revenue Service would enforce the provision with sports teams. Mr. Halem, of Major League Baseball, said the league was asking the Treasury Department for guidance on how to come up with valuations for tax purposes. If such a system was the intended result of the law, he said, \u201cthen write some regulations, tell us what you mean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI.R.S. officials declined to comment on whether the agency would issue future rulings on the tax treatment of sports trades. Treasury officials did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike many franchises, the Astros have aggressively worked the baseball trade market to improve their roster. Last year, on their way to their first World Series championship, they engineered a last-minute deal ahead of the league\u2019s trade deadline to acquire Justin Verlander, a veteran starting pitcher midway through a six-year, $162 million contract, from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for three up-and-coming young players. Last month, the Astros acquired the veteran pitcher Gerrit Cole from the Pittsburgh Pirates in a similar trade.\n\nFor decades, teams have not paid taxes on such trades, and thus have not had to account for the value of the assets they are exchanging, for tax purposes. A 1967 ruling from the Internal Revenue Service allowed baseball owners to depreciate the cost of player contracts over several years, thus reducing the team\u2019s taxable income. It declared that \u201ctrades of player contracts owned by major league baseball clubs will be considered exchanges of like-kind property\u201d under a section of the tax code.\n\nThat distinction was crucial. Until this year, the \u201clike-kind\u201d provision allowed owners of similar types of property, such as machinery or fleet vehicles, to swap their assets without paying taxes on either party\u2019s gains until the asset was sold. In a baseball or basketball trade, the assets aren\u2019t players, they are the players\u2019 contracts \u2014 and the I.R.S. was allowing them to be exchanged without fear of taxation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe new law breaks that peace, by limiting like-kind exchanges to \u201creal property,\u201d which is shorthand for land or other real estate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that they thought about baseball when they thought about this change,\u201d said Kari Smoker, an accounting professor at SUNY Brockport who has consulted for the N.B.A. and National Hockey League players\u2019 associations in legislative disputes over sports taxation. \u201cIt raises all kinds of issues, which I think were easier to ignore, probably, when we had a simple rule that it was a like-kind exchange.\u201d\n\nMr. Verlander, for example, was clearly a more immediately valuable asset to the Astros than the three prospects they traded to get him. He gave up only four runs in his five regular-season starts for the team, then won four straight starts to begin the playoffs. In very simple terms, he brought value to the Astros in a trade, and had the new law been in place last year, the team would have owed taxes on that added value.\n\nBut what, exactly, was that value? Was it the size of his contract? Mr. Verlander earned $28 million last year, while the players traded for him drew minor league salaries. Was it the additional wins he brought to the team? Statisticians estimate Mr. Verlander gave the Astros nearly two more wins last season, a value that, depending on the statistician, could reach $20 million. Or was it some calculation of the total future value Mr. Verlander will bring to the team, minus the total future value it gave up in the prospects it traded away \u2014 and possibly adjusted for the amount the team will have to pay Mr. Verlander?\n\nComplicating matters further is that teams value players differently, and one player might help a certain team far more than another team. A struggling club with a surplus of starting pitchers might trade one to a playoff contender in desperate need of one, in exchange for position players who could improve a struggling lineup. In that case, both teams could, reasonably, be considered to have gained value in the trade, and thus would owe taxes on it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is exactly how Adam Guttridge views the trade of Mr. Verlander \u2014 as a win-win for both the Astros and Tigers, which would have resulted in a capital-gains tax bill for each of them. Mr. Guttridge is a former manager of baseball research and development for the Milwaukee Brewers and a co-founder of NEIFI, a consultancy that has developed software to attach a dollar value to every professional ballplayer and his expected future performance.\n\nHow to calculate such value for tax purposes \u201cis the question that somebody has to answer, that nobody in the baseball space has,\u201d Mr. Guttridge said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly no consensus among the 30 teams.\u201d\n\nSeveral baseball executives declined to comment on the change and how it could affect their willingness to trade players in the future, including the general manager of the Astros, Jeff Luhnow.\n\nBasketball could be an even trickier proposition, because it taxes teams if they exceed a certain amount of total player salary for the season. This year, the Portland Trail Blazers traded a player with a modest contract in order to get under the tax threshold, saving themselves millions. The Cleveland Cavaliers made a series of trades that pushed them over the threshold. Some N.B.A. executives \u2014 who would not speak for publication \u2014 wondered if the Trail Blazers would need to pay federal tax on the money they avoided in league taxes as a result of a trade.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, did not return a request for comment on whether he would be inclined to support a bill to change the law for sports teams. Neither did Mr. Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, who reveled in the Astros championship run last year.\n\n\u201cAt my desk,\u201d he posted on Twitter, alongside a picture of himself, on Nov. 1, the day of Game 7 of the World Series, \u201cwearing my #Astros tie, putting final touches on the first bold #TaxReform in 31 years.\u201d", "keywords": ["law", "harder", "tax", "curveball", "teams", "astros", "makes", "mr", "trade", "players", "value", "league", "trades", "baseball"], "polarity": 0.06499281968031968, "subjectivity": 0.3931479978354978},

We let her in, only to discover that our tenant had pulled out his catheter and was incoherent. The nurse practitioner called 911, and the police arrived and did an assessment; they recommended that our tenant be moved to a place where his needs could be met. But they said moving him against his will would require a social worker\u2019s recommendation, plus other legal actions.\n\nWe could not reach his relative by phone, despite multiple attempts.

But I\u2019m worried that our tenant will try to cook something and start a fire, injuring himself and possibly our family.

And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a house he inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans. I really had no recourse but to stay there, as he was my transport to the airport several hours away, and I did. In retrospect, I worry about him and his mental state. What can I do?\n\nName Withheld\n\nHow long has he been in the house? If he\u2019s in the process of discarding the detritus of his parents\u2019 lives, it may just be that this is going slowly, especially if he\u2019s an only child. He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem.

In a report on digital taxation issued on Friday, which was separate from the European Union proposal, the organization said that more than 110 countries agreed to review the international tax system, parts of which had been rendered obsolete by the digital economy.\n\nOfficials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\n\n\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\n\nPascal Saint-Amans, the director of the O.E.C.D.\u2019s Center for Tax Policy and Administration, said that the level of animosity could undermine what had been a coordinated, global effort to crack down on tax avoidance.\n\n\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.\n\nFor example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.\n\nAmazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAmazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.\n\nWithin the past few years, the European Commission has ordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes and levied fines against other tech giants for abusing their dominant market positions. In January, European antitrust officials fined Qualcomm, the chip maker, \u20ac997 million for illegally shutting rivals out of the market for certain smartphone and tablet chipsets for more than five years. Qualcomm said it would appeal the ruling.\n\nLast year, the European Commission fined Google \u20ac2.42 billion for using its search engine to favor its own comparison shopping service \u2014 called Google Shopping \u2014 in search results while demoting results of rival services. Google has appealed the ruling.\n\nNow, as the European Union prepares to institute comprehensive new data protection rules in May, European regulators have opened a novel line of attack. They are investigating the tech giants\u2019 vast information-gathering operations as potential anti-competitive abuses.\n\nIn December, Germany\u2019s federal cartel office said Facebook had abused its dominant position by requiring its users to let the social network \u201climitlessly amass\u201d data by tracking them through other online services \u2014 including the Facebook-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. Antitrust regulators said they were \u201cnot convinced that users have given their effective consent\u201d to Facebook\u2019s data practices and that the extent of the data collection violated mandatory European data protection principles.\n\nIn a blog post, Facebook said that it was cooperating with the German agency, but challenged the claim that it had a dominant position, saying that the social network was merely \u201cpopular in Germany.\u201d The company also said it would \u201cbe working directly with relevant data protection officials\u201d to ensure compliance with the upcoming European data regulation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.\n\nThe exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\n\n\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201d\n\nAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.\n\nIn 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.\n\nBut European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.\n\nThere is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.", "keywords": ["europes", "tax", "european", "planned", "digital", "heightens", "companies", "data", "states", "american", "million", "taxes", "tensions", "united"], "polarity": 0.07509460317460316, "subjectivity": 0.30859266955266945},

In a brief filed last week, Mr. Olson called the administration\u2019s position \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cdisturbingly disingenuous.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Olson said his team had urged the solicitor general\u2019s office to move fast enough to allow a decision this term. \u201cWe got no explanation\u201d for the delay, he said. \u201cIt seemed unconscionably long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 11 families who are victims of terrorism and who have suffered a lot,\u201d Mr. Olson said. \u201cThis is so painful and difficult for them.\u201d\n\nThe families had sued the two Palestinian groups under the Antiterrorism Act of 1992, which was designed to allow such suits by giving federal courts jurisdiction over acts of international terrorism against Americans. After a seven-week jury trial in 2015 in Manhattan, the plaintiffs won $218.5 million, which was automatically tripled under the 1992 law.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, threw out the award, saying the trial court had lacked jurisdiction over the Palestinian groups because they did not have a substantial presence in the United States and had not set out specifically to kill and injure Americans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We will continue to support wherever possible all lawful actions to fight terrorism and provide redress to the victims of terrorist attacks and their families.\u201d\n\nWhen the Supreme Court asks the solicitor general for his or her views on whether to hear an appeal, as it does about 25 times each term, it presumably wants to know both whether the case warrants the justices\u2019 attention and whether the party seeking review is right.\n\nMr. Francisco gave only half an answer, taking no position on whether the appeals court\u2019s decision was correct. According to Mr. Olson\u2019s brief, \u201cresearch revealed only one other instance since 2014 in which the solicitor general did not state a view on the merits\u201d in similar circumstances.\n\nThe two sides disagree about how many cases will be thwarted by the appeals court\u2019s ruling. \u201cIt is far from clear that the court of appeals\u2019 approach will foreclose many claims that would otherwise go forward in federal courts,\u201d Mr. Francisco wrote for the administration.\n\nThe entire House of Representatives and 23 senators disagreed. In briefs filed last April, they said the appeals court\u2019s ruling had cut the heart out of the statute, effectively nullifying it.\n\nWhen a federal court strikes down parts of a federal law, the solicitor general typically defends the statute. In his brief, Mr. Olson, a former solicitor general, used unusually harsh words in criticizing the current one for taking a different approach.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 argument that this court should not address this issue is, to put it bluntly,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca blatant abdication of duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose are harsh words, and they will get the justices\u2019 attention when they meet in private next week to discuss whether to hear the case, Sokolow v.

Wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, Bannon\u2019s advice is strange. After all, by any normative understanding, \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cxenophobe\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d are negative words from both a moral and rational point of view. Their definitions, taken from any standard dictionary, will bear this out. Racism, xenophobia and nativism embody, in their very meanings, both irrationality and unfairness. Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it. And he recommends presenting such irrationality as virtuous.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school.

Robb, argued that two labor board decisions in December, one of which changed the legal standard for determining joint employment, might have weakened aspects of the case against McDonald\u2019s and made a settlement more likely.\n\nIn his request for a stay, Mr. Robb said a settlement could \u201cfacilitate far more prompt and immediate remedial relief for the employees impacted by the alleged unfair labor practices.\u201d\n\nBefore the December decision by the board, a parent company like McDonald\u2019s could be considered a joint employer if it exerted indirect control over workers at a franchisee, or if it had the right to exercise control over workers that it nonetheless did not exercise.\n\nAfter the board\u2019s decision in December, a company had to have direct and immediate control over workers to be considered a joint employer.\n\nAt the time he sought a stay, labor groups argued that Mr. Robb\u2019s logic was specious because the board\u2019s case against McDonald\u2019s did not hinge on which definition of joint employment applied.\n\nLawyers for the Service Employees International Union argued that even if the general counsel preferred to seek a settlement, it made no sense to stop the trial, which was only days from concluding, in order to do so.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a court filing, they argued that stopping the trial would give McDonald\u2019s an advantage by preventing union lawyers from cross-examining a key witness, and that it fostered \u201ca game of hide-the-ball.\u201d\n\nThen, last month, one of Mr. Robb\u2019s primary arguments for a pause in the trial was upended when the labor board, on a procedural question, reversed its December decision narrowing the definition of a joint employer. At that point, the joint employer definition reverted to what it had been earlier in the trial.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, stated in a March 7 letter that the board\u2019s reversal \u201celiminates whatever support may have existed for your efforts to settle the McDonald\u2019s case so near to the trial\u2019s close.\u201d They urged Mr. Robb to \u201cswiftly resume and finish the trial.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Robb\u2019s office pressed ahead with its efforts to reach a settlement. Last week, lawyers from the labor board\u2019s regional offices abruptly reached out to several former McDonald\u2019s workers involved in the case. In one instance, a labor board lawyer called a worker and asked if she \u201cwas ok with $50k\u201d for back pay as part of the settlement, according to an email between the board and Mr. Wissinger, one of the union lawyers. The offer was conditional on the worker\u2019s waiving her right to be reinstated in her old job.\n\nMr. Wissinger said that the calls created the impression that workers needed to accept the offers before they consulted with him or his colleagues or anyone else, and that at least two did.\n\n\u201cIt was a done deal by the time we found out,\u201d Mr. Wissinger said. \u201cThey were completely cutting us out of the process.\u201d\n\nJennifer Abruzzo, who served as deputy general counsel of the labor board until 2017, said settlement discussions that excluded lawyers who backed the workers were a break with custom.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unusual,\u201d Ms. Abruzzo said. \u201cThe charging party is the one that the regions typically go to.

Mueller III, raising questions about whether he is laying the groundwork to try to fire him.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets alarmed some Republicans, who spoke out on Sunday morning talk shows. To assess reaction within the party, The New York Times reached out to Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate, as well as Republican members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and other leading Republicans.\n\nRepublican congressional leadership\n\nSpeaker Paul D.

That's why I agree with the many others who have called for the appointment of an additional special counsel who, unlike Mueller, has the authority to look into the potential abuses of the FISA system that allowed the Democrat-funded Steele dossier to serve as the basis for the initial F.B.I. investigation.\n\n\u201cThe addition of an outside special counsel will ensure our ability to have full faith in our investigations into the very serious threats Putin's rogue government poses to our elections and nation as a whole.\u201d\n\nHave not commented\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee\n\nSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader\n\nCongressional Intelligence Committees\n\nThe Times reached out to every Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

{"title": "\n                    Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html", "text": "\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe division within Google spilled into the open last year when James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a memo critical of its diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["internal", "hard", "lawsuit", "mr", "diversity", "work", "employees", "damore", "trying", "googles", "fired", "diversify", "google"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Stone Jr., one of the president\u2019s oldest confidantes.\n\nProjecting strength, control and power, whether as a New York developer or domineering reality television host, has always been vital to Mr. Trump. But in his first year in the White House, according to his friends, he found himself feeling tentative and anxious, intimidated by the role of president, a fact that he never openly admitted but that they could sense, people close to the president said.\n\nThis, after all, is someone for whom leaving the security of Trump Tower and moving to Washington and the White House was a daunting prospect. Even now, as he has grown more comfortable in the job, he rarely leaves the White House unless he is certain the environment will be friendly, such as at one of his own properties. Rallies are rarely scheduled in areas that could invite large protests.\n\nFor months, aides were mostly able to redirect a neophyte president with warnings about the consequences of his actions, and mostly control his public behavior.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose most able to influence him were John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general turned chief of staff, and Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and director of the National Economic Council. And few people had more ability to blunt the president\u2019s potentially self-destructive impulses than Hope Hicks, his communications director, who has been one of his closest advisers since the earliest days of his 2016 campaign.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have said that Mr. Trump was trapped in a West Wing cage built by Mr. Kelly, and has finally broken loose.\n\nThe reality is more complicated, his closest aides say. They say Mr. Trump now feels he doesn\u2019t need the expertise of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Cohn or Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil executive he made secretary of state. If he once suspected they were smarter or better equipped to lead the country and protect his presidency, he doesn\u2019t believe that now.\n\nTwo of those men are now on their way out. And Mr. Trump has an ambiguous relationship with the third, Mr. Kelly, whom he alternately assures that his job is secure and disparages to other people. Ms. Hicks is leaving the White House in the coming days, a departure that has caused concern among his allies about how he will cope without her in the long term.\n\nOutside the White House, there are few friends the president will listen to. Some of them warned him to back off his tariffs plan, telling him that he would undo what he had accomplished with the tax bill. Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t agree, and that was that.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Contrary to descriptions of a constantly fuming, beleaguered president, friends and advisers say Mr. Trump is more at ease than he has been in some time. What seems like unchecked chaos to almost everyone else is Mr. Trump feeling he is in his element.\n\n\u201cHe seems more relaxed, believe it or not,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who spent several hours with the president during two St. Patrick\u2019s Day events on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a combination of being more relaxed and also being frustrated by the fact that he feels like a lot of what he didn\u2019t succeed at, or what hasn\u2019t worked, is that he wasn\u2019t allowed to be Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nHis close allies, like Representative Mark Meadows, the North Carolina Republican who is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, believe the president is finding his stride and learning how to navigate Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI see it more as a function of just, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve taken a year to understand the different dynamics within a broad array of personalities,\u2019 and so now it\u2019s all about putting together a team to go the distance for the next three years,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nWarnings of dire consequences from his critics have failed to materialize. When Mr. Cohn announced that he was resigning, the predictions were that the stock market would plummet. There was only a minor dip by the end of the next day.\n\nAnd on North Korea, even the grayest of foreign policy beards have conceded that Mr. Trump might be able to accomplish something.\n\n\u201cThe president has his own original style, and it\u2019s unlikely to be changed at this stage of his life,\u201d Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, said in an interview. \u201cBut it also is conducive to bringing forward opportunities like this Korean conversation. It is not what we traditionalists would have recommended in the first place.\n\n\u201cBut I have to say, when I have thought it through, and how it could play out, it could restore a political initiative to us, and could compel a conversation with countries\u201d otherwise disinclined.\n\nSome worried aides are less sanguine. They view the weekend\u2019s attacks on Mr. Mueller and the F.B.I. as a particularly disturbing taste of what they believe could come. They say privately that Mr. Trump does not understand the job the way he believes he does, and that they fear he will become even less inclined to take advice.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether his attacks on Mr. Mueller are anything more than an effort to define the terms of the public conversation about the investigation, and the parameters of an interview with the president that the special counsel is seeking.\n\nBut the possibility that Mr. Trump would be emboldened enough to fire Mr. Mueller was raised on Sunday by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nSuch a move, Mr. Graham said on CNN, would be \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of the Trump presidency.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "mr", "conversation", "aides", "emboldened", "say", "trump", "feels", "york", "house", "kelly", "really", "newly"], "polarity": 0.10543237144799646, "subjectivity": 0.38356803786491295},

That campaign has so far failed to do so, and has instead caused the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crisis, with the worst outbreak of cholera in contemporary history and widespread child malnutrition.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was a tacit acknowledgment of the weaknesses of the Saudi armed forces.\n\nHuman rights groups say that Saudi Arabia has failed to meet its promises. \u201cSaudi Arabia had made pledges to make its engagement in Yemen less deadly and destructive,\u201d said Scott Paul, a policy specialist on Yemen at Oxfam America. \u201cWe do see the stark evidence that the situation has continued to deteriorate \u2014 innocent civilians continue to be caught up and killed in this crisis.\u201d\n\nA report to the United Nations Security Council in January described coalition \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d as \u201clargely inadequate and ineffective,\u201d and said that \u201cthe use of precision-guided weapons is a strong indicator that the intended targets were those affected by the airstrikes.\u201d\n\nWith Saudi Arabia flying as many as 200 missions a day in Yemen, the kingdom is seeking to buy more of those precision-guided weapons. Thomas A. Kennedy, the chief executive of Raytheon, met with State Department officials this month to promote the proposed sale of munitions to Saudi Arabia and the Emirates.\n\n\u201cWe value our 50-year partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and look forward to continuing to help meet their security needs,\u201d said Michael F. Doble, a spokesman for Raytheon.\n\nThe purchase, said William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, would be \u201csubstantial by standards of U.S.-Saudi trade in munitions, certainly one of the largest if not the largest for systems of the kind it likely includes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2017, the United States sold roughly $610 million in weapons and munitions to Saudi Arabia and $48 million in firearms to the Emirates. Bigger equipment, however, such as missile defense systems, made up a large portion of the purchases for both countries over the past year.\n\nDuring his trip to Saudi Arabia last year, his first overseas visit as president, Mr. Trump offered the kingdom a $110 billion arms package.

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators\u2019 perception of both.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pressure cooker,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the district\u2019s chief of schools. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across America.\u201d\n\nWhile critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.\n\nBernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\n[ALSO READ: Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys]\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "students", "punished", "national", "quandary", "black", "ms", "york", "guidance", "teachers", "confronts", "minnesota", "discipline", "districts", "school"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785}
