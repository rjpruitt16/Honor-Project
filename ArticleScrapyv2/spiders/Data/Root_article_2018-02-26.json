It\u2019s one thing to ask teachers to carry guns, but it\u2019s a whole other thing to make believe that you\u2019re a tough guy when you were born a whole bitch.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that he would have charged into the Parkland, Fla., school during the shooting even if he\u2019d been unarmed.\n\n\u201cI really believe I\u2019d run in there even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon,\u201d Trump told governors who were meeting at the White House to discuss school safety, NBC News reports.\n\nBitch, please.\n\nIf the president of PumpFake, Neb., is so \u2019bout it, how about he ditch the security and save taxpayers some money? How about he come to Chicago to talk about gun violence? How about he come to a news station that isn\u2019t Fox News to discuss his broken-down and ineffective policies?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president has always been a bitch. It\u2019s the reason that real decorated war hero Sen.

In fact, he\u2019s not even remotely tough. Trump is the dude who comes to the basketball court in a full official NBA shorts set to talk about how, when he was younger, he used to dunk on guys, but he never plays. He\u2019s the guy at the barbershop who claims that he\u2019s slept with every woman but who everyone knows is really lonely. He\u2019s the guy who goes golfing and cheats.\n\nSeriously, it\u2019s one thing to add a little Lawry\u2019s to your stories when you\u2019re sitting in the barbershop or on the basketball court; it\u2019s another to tip a trough of seasoning onto a national tragedy when you\u2019re the president. This is a time for grieving, and I wish someone would yank the president\u2019s comb-over and hip him to how to behave. Now isn\u2019t the time for this male-bravado bullshit while Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students are still struggling to make it to class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeventeen students and teachers were mercilessly gunned down, and the president has not only defended the National Rifle Association, guns, gun owners and NRA spokespeople but has also called for some teachers to be trained in taking down a school shooter. And now he\u2019s playing cowboy behind his Secret Service.\n\nCut the shit, draft dodger.\n\nAnd Trump didn\u2019t stop there. He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter! The officer could\u2019ve saved lives and he froze up. It happens, and I know that this man is going to beat himself up way more than the president tried to on Monday. He\u2019s already resigned from the force. But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more cowardly\u2014not running into the school when you hear shooting, or beating someone up after the fact when you haven\u2019t done one remotely heroic thing in your life.\n\nIf anything, the officer\u2019s inaction should be proof that the president\u2019s harebrained Acme scheme of arming teachers is really fucking stupid. If an armed officer couldn\u2019t confront the shooter, then what makes the president think that a teacher would? But this is what happens when you\u2019ve lived a lily-white, privileged life on your father\u2019s fortune and never had to really fight for anything: You craft idiotic policies and criticize those in action because, well, that\u2019s what punks do.", "keywords": ["teachers", "school", "officer", "bout", "president", "hes", "wouldve", "trump", "punkass", "gun", "thing", "really", "shooter", "didnt", "florida", "run", "talking"], "polarity": -0.07832539682539683, "subjectivity": 0.5137619047619049},

I want to do that shit. Like, I got desire ... not for nobody else ... it just ... I want something where I can say, \u2018I fucking did that\u2019 ... me personally.\u201d\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nAccording to the complaint, Horry County, S.C., police knew McDowell as someone who had made white supremacist connections while serving prison sentences for various criminal offenses. He posted rambling, expletive-filled white supremacist rants on Facebook, and in early January, requested an \u201ciron\u201d\u2014or gun\u2014from someone through Facebook instant messenger, according to the complaint. Less than a week later, he was in touch with an undercover FBI employee whom McDowell believed handled problems for the Aryan Nations, a group that espouses racist and anti-Semitic beliefs. McDowell\u2019s case is somewhat similar to Roof\u2019s in that Roof, too, expressed frustration that, in his view, white supremacists were not taking enough action. Roof, who was sentenced to death last month for shooting and killing nine black parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, wrote in a journal that he \u201cwould rather live imprisoned knowing I took action for my race than to live with the torture of sitting idle\u201d and suggested he hoped others might follow suit. \u201cIt isn\u2019t up to me anymore,\u201d Roof said. \u201cI did what I could do. I\u2019ve done all I can do. I did what I thought would make the biggest wave, and now the fate of our race sits in the hands of my brothers who continue to live freely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcDowell apparently had not picked a specific target and did not have a plan of attack, but he told the undercover FBI employee that he wanted to target nonwhites at a county outside of where he lived, and he did not want to get caught.\n\n\u201cI got the heart to do this,\u201d McDowell said, according to authorities.\n\nMcDowell, according to officials, asked the undercover FBI employee to buy him a handgun, and that serves as the basis for the criminal charge against him; McDowell is a felon and therefore forbidden from possessing a firearm. The employee and McDowell hatched a plan in which the employee would pick him up from his mother\u2019s house and drive him to his grandfather\u2019s house to get money to pay for the gun and ammunition, authorities say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, McDowell and the employee met as planned, and McDowell purchased a .40-caliber handgun with a shaved-down firing pin for $109, officials say. He was then arrested by federal agents.\n\nInterestingly enough (not), in none of the reports that I\u2019ve read about McDowell has he been described as a terrorist, but had he been brown-skinned and Muslim, the efforts to tar him with that descriptor would have been immediate and endless. Let\u2019s call it what it is: These white supremacists plotting these actions are domestic terrorists, plain and simple.\n\nIt\u2019s also ironic that McDowell would claim to have \u201cthe heart to do this\u201d while simultaneously claiming that he did not want to get caught. You are either down for your cause or you aren\u2019t, you fucking pussy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, how are you plotting an attack you need financing from your grandparents to complete? This is like the Kmart \u201cBlue Light Special\u201d of terror-attack plots.\n\nBut whatever.

Black Lives Matter, a group that many whites want so badly to be considered a terrorist organization, failed to kill a single individual in 2017, as it has during every year of its existence. Antifa, which President Donald Trump condemned as one of the groups in Charlottesville, Va., that had very bad people \u201con both sides,\u201d did not cause a death last year.

In April, Kori Muhammad went on a shooting spree in Fresno, Calif. Muhammad\u2019s father said that he was trying to start a war between black and whites.

He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter! The officer could\u2019ve saved lives and he froze up. It happens, and I know that this man is going to beat himself up way more than the president tried to on Monday. He\u2019s already resigned from the force. But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more cowardly\u2014not running into the school when you hear shooting, or beating someone up after the fact when you haven\u2019t done one remotely heroic thing in your life.\n\nIf anything, the officer\u2019s inaction should be proof that the president\u2019s harebrained Acme scheme of arming teachers is really fucking stupid. If an armed officer couldn\u2019t confront the shooter, then what makes the president think that a teacher would? But this is what happens when you\u2019ve lived a lily-white, privileged life on your father\u2019s fortune and never had to really fight for anything: You craft idiotic policies and criticize those in action because, well, that\u2019s what punks do.", "keywords": ["teachers", "school", "officer", "bout", "president", "hes", "wouldve", "trump", "punkass", "gun", "thing", "really", "shooter", "didnt", "florida", "run", "talking"], "polarity": -0.07832539682539683, "subjectivity": 0.5137619047619049},

According to multiple outlets, court documents that were unsealed on Wednesday reveal that Taylor Michael Wilson had participated in the deadly Unite the Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and expressed a desire to murder black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s more about the terrorism charge from Newsweek:\n\nWilson entered an engineer\u2019s seat of an Amtrak train after midnight on Oct. 22 and started \u201cplaying with the controls\u201d of the train, according to [FBI Special Agent Monte] Czaplewski\u2019s account. No one was injured or killed in the attempted attack.\n\nThe Lincoln Journal Star adds that Wilson was found to be armed, carrying a \u201c.38-caliber handgun in his waistband and a speed loader in this pocket.\u201d He also wore a backpack containing more speed loaders, a box of ammunition, a knife, tin snips, scissors and a ventilation mask, authorities said. More weapons were later found at his home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson also carried a business card for the National Socialist Movement, which Newsweek describes as a neo-Nazi organization with ties to the American Nazi Party.\n\nThis makes Wilson another in a string of \u201calt-right\u201d-affiliated men who have recently committed or been charged in violent and murderous acts. Newsweek lists William Edward Atchison, a regular commenter on the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, who killed two students at his high school last year; Nicholas Giampa, the Virginia teen who allegedly killed his girlfriend\u2019s parents days before Christmas; and Matthew Riehl, the Denver man who ambushed a Douglas County deputy on New Year\u2019s Eve, as just a few examples.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Journal Star reports, an informant told the FBI that Wilson \u201chad expressed an interest in \u2018killing black people\u2019 and others besides whites,\u201d although it\u2019s unclear when the informant alerted the FBI. Wilson is also a suspect in a 2016 road rage incident in St. Charles, Mo., where a man pointed a gun at a black woman while driving on Interstate 70 for \u201cno apparent reason.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s consider for a moment that, according to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, between 2000 and 2016, white supremacists were responsible for more homicides than any other domestic extremist movement (49 homicides in 26 attacks in that 16-year span).\n\nCan we talk about how these white identity extremists were radicalized? Better than talk about it, can we study it? Is there a hotline? Should we determine terrorist-threat levels for WIEs?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonths before Nicholas Giampa allegedly killed his girlfriend\u2019s parents in their home, his neighbors suspected that he had mowed a a 40-foot swastika into a community field. The 17-year-old\u2019s neighbors opted not to call the police but instead talk to Nicholas\u2019 parents. They were assured that the teen was getting treatment for his \u201cbehavioral issues,\u201d as the Washington Post reported.\n\nOne neighbor who came across the swastika told Post reporters, \u201cFor the first time, I was fearful that there was someone living in our neighborhood who was capable of incredibly irrational behavior.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the problem: Nicholas Giampa was not acting irrationally. Neither was Wilson. And in all likelihood, neither was Riehl. They know what they\u2019re doing. They know why they\u2019re doing it. They\u2019re broadcasting, in so many ways and so many mediums, what it is they intend to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen are we going to do something about it?", "keywords": ["parents", "supremacist", "attempting", "accused", "theyre", "attack", "amtrak", "train", "white", "man", "killed", "talk", "nicholas", "surprise", "fbi", "wilson", "missouri", "terror"], "polarity": 0.0638961038961039, "subjectivity": 0.2979045954045954},

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["rick", "school", "yes", "nra", "gov", "enforcement", "trump", "scott", "health", "gun", "ranks", "celebrate", "proposed", "law", "mental", "shouldnt", "florida", "weapons"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

She posted comments about how she wanted to harm people who attended \u201cfree speech\u201d rallies. She talked about radical ideology and even shared pictures, names and addresses of U.S. soldiers.

She hasn\u2019t committed an act of terror; nor has she ever given money to a terrorist organization. But make no mistake about it\u2014in the eyes of the law, Yassin is a terrorist.\n\nAndrew Anglin is the founder and owner of the Daily Stormer\u2014the most popular white supremacist website in the country. Earlier this year he incited his readers into harassing American University Student Government President Taylor Dumpson until she required police protection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a civil lawsuit against Anglin, he also initiated a \u201ctroll storm\u201d of death threats, promises of physical violence and harassment against Tanya Gersh, a Jewish real estate attorney in Whitefish, Mont. The lawsuit states (pdf):\n\n\n\n14. Mr. Anglin and his followers targeted Ms. Gersh\u2019s husband, as well. Mr. Gersh received many threatening, hateful, and harassing phone calls, voicemails, false online reviews of his law firm and emails including this one: \u201cPut your uppity slut wife Tanya back in her cage, you rat-faced kike. Tell your scamming son [name omitted] to kill himself, too. Day of the rope soon for your entire family.\u201d 88. Mr. Anglin also published the Twitter handle of Ms. Gersh\u2019s twelve- year-old son and encouraged readers to take to Twitter and \u201ctell them what you think of his whore mother\u2019s vicious attack on the community of Whitefish.\u201d Mr. Anglin called Ms. Gersh\u2019s son a \u201ccreepy little faggot\u201d and a \u201cscamming little kike.\u201d Mr. Anglin further accused Ms. Gersh\u2019s son of \u201cpushing advertising scams\u201d on his Twitter followers. 89. Mr. Anglin also published Mr. Gersh\u2019s work phone number and work email, and included a link for readers to submit a Google review of Mr. Gersh\u2019s law firm. Mr. Anglin further encouraged readers to \u201cgive him a call or stop by his office and let him know what you think of his wife\u2019s behavior, advise him to get a leash on that hoe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese two cases highlight the disparity in the urgency with which law enforcement agencies treat white supremacists and their organizations. Both people in the above examples essentially threatened and harassed American citizens. Both used the internet, social media and the public domain to intimidate and cause terror.\n\n\n\nYet Anglin is not wanted by law enforcement agencies for terrorism, harassment or any crime. More important, numerous neo-Nazi, white nationalist and white supremacist organizations operate in broad daylight. They perpetuate violence and extremism without impunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they immune?\n\nBefore her arrest, Yassin had been watched by numerous federal agencies responsible for eliminating terrorism, including the FBI. Her allegiance to foreign terrorism was deemed a credible threat because the Islamic State is believed to have inspired the murders of at least 68 Americans.\n\nTo be clear, none of the nearly 70 deaths have been attributed directly to ISIS. Authorities have only linked the group to social media accounts and websites that have \u201cradicalized\u201d perpetrators or \u201cinspired\u201d the incidents of terror. That is enough to land their sympathizers on the list of people who law enforcement agencies train their sights on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report entitled \u201cWhite Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence\u201d (pdf). The agency cited the statistic that white supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 \u2026 more than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201d\n\nWhen these homegrown terrorists staged a May rally in Berkeley, Calif., that grew violent, no one was charged with domestic terror. When police confiscated hundreds of weapons at a Portland, Ore., white supremacist rally in June, it still did not rise to the level of terror.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough white supremacists laid siege to the entire town of Charlottesville, Va., and a woman was killed\u2014despite the warnings of the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2014none of the participants have yet to be called \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d\n\nWhy is that? If these people are not terrorists, worthy of being placed on the government\u2019s terror watch list, then who is?\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center maintains a list of suspected terrorists. Being added to the Terrorist Screening Database is not an arbitrary process. The Intercept uncovered the document (pdf), \u201cWatchlisting Guidance: National Counterterrorism Center 2013 Publication,\u201d that spells out how one lands on this list. It states that:\n\n\n\nFor watchlisting purposes under this Guidance, \u201cTERRORIST and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\u201d combine elements from various federal definitions and are considered to: 1.14.1 involve violent acts or acts that are dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure which are violations of U.S. law, or may have been, if those acts occurred in the United States, and 1.14.2 appear to be intended\u2014 to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n\nto influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\n\nto affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage-taking.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that these organizations espouse violence against human life. Just before he killed Heather Heyer, James Fields marched with the neo-Nazi group Vanguard America in Charlottesville. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Dylann Roof was a regular visitor and commenter on the Daily Stormer before he committed the mass murder at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. The people who beat Deandre Harris with poles and sticks in Charlottesville wore white nationalist gear.\n\nThey undoubtedly converged on Charlottesville to \u201cintimidate a civilian population.\u201d White nationalist Richard Spencer called it a \u201chuge moral victory in terms of the show of force.\u201d They also satisfied the watch list requirement that defines a terrorist activity as intending to \u201cinfluence the policy of a government by intimidation ... or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction.\u201d They said beforehand that they wanted to stop the city government\u2019s already cemented decision to remove the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nAccording to the TSC document, anyone is worthy of being added to the list according to the government\u2019s definition of reasonable suspicion. The report defines \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d as applying to anyone who has \u201crepeated contact with individuals identified by the IC [independent counsel] as teaching or espousing an ideology that includes the justification of the unlawful use of violence or violent extremism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Watchlisting Guidance reads like a thorough explanation of the white supremacist movement. Every federal agency is aware of the existential threat it poses to America. Law enforcement officers know exactly where members can be found, and know their racist, extremist ideology.\n\nYet somehow they are not considered terrorists.\n\nThis is why Heather Heyer is dead. This is why Deandre Harris\u2019 scalp is held together with stitches. This is why the bodies of Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lee Lance, DePayne Middleton, Clementa C. Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel Simmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson rest in Charleston cemeteries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of federal law enforcement\u2019s apathy toward the lives of American citizens. Because no one is willing to call the purveyors of hate a threat to our nation. Because of the unwillingness of people like Donald Trump to condemn the fires of extremism they helped kindle. Because the purveyors of hate know that they can terrorize, threaten and kill without worrying that they will be painted with the broad brush of \u201cterrorist.\u201d\n\nBut mostly because they are white.", "keywords": ["terrorist", "federal", "law", "anglin", "list", "states", "gershs", "mr", "violence", "white", "arent", "supremacists", "watch", "terror"], "polarity": -0.004407051282051284, "subjectivity": 0.3648536559594252},

The president of the United States sympathizes with and will provide aid and comfort to white supremacists, and he\u2019s put together an administration to help those groups achieve goals they can\u2019t accomplish through democratic means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only questions now are how do you live in a terrorist state, how do you resist a terrorist state and, most importantly, can you win? There is a little hope, but it takes a lot of historical digging to find the right plan moving forward.\n\n\n\nAnyone who is shocked or crying on cable networks after Trump\u2019s Charlottesville press conference has either been blind to his entire administration or feels guilty about his or her complicity in normalizing it.\n\nTrump hired Steve Bannon, from the \u201calt-right\u201d and white nationalist website Breitbart; he made Jeff Sessions attorney general; he hired Stephen Miller for his communications team; he hired Sebastian Gorka and Michael Anton\u2014and that is a fairly substantial list of men with strong ties to white nationalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you consider that dozens of positions like ambassadorships and crucial political offices that have still not been staffed by this administration, it really stands out that Trump has made such a concerted effort to get white nationalists set and ensconced in his administration. NFL owners keep drafting and signing players with domestic violence rap sheets, and the public has come to accept that these owners either are actual abusers themselves or have no problems with the abuse of women by their employees.\n\nTrump\u2019s staff selections are no different. Who one hires is a reflection of one\u2019s values, and he\u2019s hired a bunch of white nationalists.\n\nUnderstanding what white supremacy means and how it relates to Trump\u2019s terror advocacy is essential to the survival of the United States and of African Americans in particular. There are \u201clevels to this,\u201d and understanding what level of racial danger he has empowered is important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite supremacy is the American baseline; it\u2019s the idea that white people are just inherently better than everybody else at just about everything. This country was founded on that idea, and there are white supremacists everywhere, with most not even realizing that they are. The social-justice-warrior \u201cally\u201d who keeps tone-policing black people on Twitter; the co-worker who keeps saying that what happened to Trayvon Martin is a \u201ctragedy\u201d but who can\u2019t quite humanize him\u2014that\u2019s white supremacy.\n\nThe next level up is bigotry. These people are white supremacists who actually dislike black people. Bigots join the Ku Klux Klan, kill black people and redline black neighborhoods.\n\nWhite nationalists are the ultimate evolution of white supremacy and bigotry; they are the Hulk to white supremacy\u2019s Bruce Banner, only whiter and more violent. White nationalists believe that America should be a white, Christian ethno-state; and their goal is to remove all non-Christian, nonwhite people from the country in any way they can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is virtually impossible to achieve this goal through democratic means, so white nationalists advocate violence and policies that will marginalize and limit the power and numbers of nonwhite people in America.\n\nSo when Trump says that some of the people in Charlottesville\u2019s Unite the Right march were \u201cgood people,\u201d he\u2019s saying that he thinks terrorism is OK. When he refers to the death of Heather Heyer and the beating of Deandre Harris and dozens of others as \u201ccriminal acts\u201d instead of terrorism, he\u2019s saying that white nationalists broke the law, but they did not threaten his conception of the state.\n\nWhen Jeff Sessions initiates policies to suppress minority voting, he\u2019s pushing white nationalist policies. When Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon develop a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and new immigration policy to limit immigrants from nonwhite countries, they\u2019re working on the white nationalist goal of the white ethno-state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are all terrorist sympathizers, and they know it, and are blatant about it. Question is: What do you do about it?\n\nFirst, recognize that as a person of color, you\u2019re on your own until this man is out of office. That means that protecting ourselves financially, educationally, politically and even physically becomes essential.\n\nThe last time African Americans faced a president who openly sympathized with a terror state was almost 100 years ago with Woodrow Wilson. Wilson\u2019s two terms in office, from 1914 to 1921, were filled with internecine violence against black people by police, aided and abetted by white vigilantes and condoned by a president who threw civil rights leaders out of the White House and reversed existing anti-discrimination policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people responded to Wilson by focusing our money and resources on our own community, supporting black newspapers to provide real information about the community, starting black organizations and supporting black art. We did not retreat to our enclaves, but emboldened and infused them with our money and time. Madam C.J. Walker\u2019s best business years were during the Wilson administration; A. Philip Randolph started The Messenger, a black socialist newspaper; Carter G. Woodson founded the first black think tank.\n\nThese weren\u2019t \u201cfeel good\u201d activities; they were counterterrorism strategies, placing the financial, educational and political power of black people back into our own hands, making alliances where needed, while primarily depending on our own resources.\n\nIn modern times, that means supporting black newspapers and sites, supporting and funding anti-white nationalist fighters and organizations; and yes, it means public actions like getting gun licenses, applying for jobs as police officers, serving on juries, and, believe it or not, even tweeting the hell out of terror-supporting political leaders and policymakers so they don\u2019t get to operate in darkness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory tells us that the Trump terrorism presidency will not be short, it will not be kind and it will not end easily. His allies in the white nationalist movement, emboldened by his tacit consent, will continue to attack and kill all across the nation, with deaths moving from speeding cars to Oklahoma City-level violence.\n\nThe best hope of the black community is to rely upon the strategies and resources of the past to survive and get out of this alive on the other side.\n\nWhich, if we\u2019re lucky, will only take about eight years.", "keywords": ["administration", "terrorist", "nationalist", "states", "hes", "means", "trump", "sympathizer", "white", "nationalists", "violence", "black", "united", "president"], "polarity": 0.06678658008658009, "subjectivity": 0.36941731601731587},

A criminal complaint claims that Varnell had originally wanted to blow up the Federal Reserve Building in Washington, D.C., using a device similar to the one used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people, because he was upset at the government.\n\nVarnell reportedly planned out everything carefully, identifying BancFirst as his target, preparing a statement that would have been posted to social media after the explosion, assembling the device and helping to load it into what he believed was a stolen van.

While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook.

But calling that moment a \u201chate crime\u201d puts the untimely and inexplicable killing of Collins into something isolated, infrequent and somewhat unusual when we already know it\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nInstead, it\u2019s essential that we begin seeing these types of incidents for what they are: acts of domestic terror instigated by the revival of sophisticated white supremacist networks. As a society, collectively, we typically waste little time in using the term \u201cterrorism\u201d to describe tragedies in places like Boston; Orlando, Fla.; and San Bernardino, Calif. Even when there are acts of \u201clone-wolf terrorism\u201d inspired by terrorist organizations abroad, law enforcement and the media are quick to apply that classification in ways that elevate our sense of alertness. Ultimately, it spurs us all into action and a need to maintain public safety for ourselves, our families and our children.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some reason, it\u2019s very difficult to apply the same standard of urgency and general alarm when the victims of racially motivated or ideological terrorism are black citizens. We found this same hesitancy right after the horrific massacre of nine black congregants, including the pastor, of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still terrorism. Even more significant is that Collins was a commissioned military officer at the time of his death, a detail that should warrant additional concern from federal authorities. Collins\u2019 alleged killer appears to have been motivated by extreme political viewpoints, and it\u2019s both confounding and concerning that law-enforcement officials don\u2019t consider acts of violence by individuals aligned with organized white supremacist networks to be on the same level as organized terrorism. Whether domestic terrorism or foreign terrorism, they still share some of the same fundamental behavioral characteristics.\n\n\n\nThis is much more than an intellectual debate over semantics or a professorial war on words. It\u2019s about the need for media and governing institutions that lead discussion and awareness of these tragedies to elevate their importance and, thus, spur better community response against dangerous acts of racism that target historically vulnerable populations.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanging that language also recognizes, and addresses, a fresh and virulent pattern of vicious racism happening right now, especially in the wake of the recent election. In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, where Collins was killed, we\u2019ve seen an increase in these incidents despite the large and very diverse communities of color living in the region.\n\nBefore Collins, there were reports of incidents ranging from scrawled racist epithets aimed at American University\u2019s first black student body president to a hanging noose at a Crofton, Md., middle school; from swastikas spray-painted on local synagogues to profanity scrawled across the home of a Northern Virginia Muslim. In D.C. alone, there has been a 62 percent increase in reported hate crimes.\n\n\n\nOverall in the United States, we\u2019re seeing an explosive increase in these types of incidents and much worse. The pattern is too pronounced to just keep minimizing them as isolated hate crimes. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino found that these hate-filled acts increased 20 percent last year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe killing of Collins stands out because we have evidence directly connecting the alleged killer to a white supremacist network spreading racist ideology online. In a similar tragedy this past March\u2014the fatal stabbing of a black man in New York City by a white man who traveled from Baltimore to \u201cthe media capital of the world\u201d to \u201cmake a statement\u201d\u2014the Manhattan district attorney didn\u2019t hesitate to prosecute it as an \u201cact of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat same standard should be applied to the Collins case. Unequivocal stands from law enforcement\u2014and media\u2014on the definition of terrorism send a clear message not only to individuals looking to copy those acts but also to organized racist networks actively targeting people of color. Ultimately, that\u2019s not just a play on words. Indeed, it\u2019s a major step toward forcefully shutting down those networks and saving people\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge H.

It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun.

If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think that the current administration emboldens this brand of hate and then preys on white America\u2019s fear by pulling out tired tropes about gang violence to avoid the obvious issues of homegrown hate and unbridled access to guns.\n\nWatch below:", "keywords": ["sessions", "school", "know", "jeff", "symphony", "gang", "think", "racist", "laws", "violence", "parkland", "nonsensical", "gun", "speech", "whistles", "shooting", "way", "florida"], "polarity": -0.06926666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.5059333333333333},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["organization", "terrorist", "nra", "right", "directly", "nras", "second", "dont", "gun", "legal", "deaths"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly.

I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence.

If you went to Wakanda, you would:\n\na. Put in an application at the vibranium mine.\n\nb. Head straight to the Foot Locker at the Wakanda Galleria for a pair of kente cloth Jordans.\n\nc.

White people who dress up to see Black Panther:\n\na. Probably dressed up for all of the Marvel movies, so this one is no different.\n\nb. Are hilarious.\n\nc. Are tone-deaf.\n\nd.

T\u2019Challa\u2019s alter ego.\n\nc. A flawed character caught between doing what\u2019s right for his people and owning up to the responsibility of his powerful gift.\n\nd.

The Wakanda Girls School for Science and Technology.\n\nb. The Dora Milaje Institute for Self-Defense.\n\nc. The Frederick Douglass/Killmonger Academy for Black Boys.\n\nd. Morehouse.\n\n5. Erik Killmonger:\n\na. Is a well-rounded antagonist who inspires sympathy while still playing the villain.\n\nb. Needs to put some shea butter on those chicken pox bumps.\n\nc. Wouldn\u2019t have been so angry if he had been invited to the family reunion and met his cousins a long time ago.\n\nd. Is a revolutionary Pan-Africanist who wants to free his people by any means necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Wakandan women:\n\na. Are all on a natural-hair journey.\n\nb. Don\u2019t have to worry about fuckboys because they have spears.\n\nc. Are a\u2019ight, but you prefer \u201credbones.\u201d\n\nd. Will never find a husband because they concentrate on stuff like science, technology and fighting instead of learning how to be submissive.\n\n7. Which one of these people is not a direct descendant of King T\u2019Chaka?\n\na. T\u2019Challa.\n\nb. Shuri.\n\nc. \u201cBrown Panther\u201d\u2014the break baby he had with a Dora Milaje in the \u201980s that no one knows about.\n\nd. Umar Johnson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8.

The traditional Wakandan farewell is:\n\na. Goodbye.\n\nb I\u2019ll holla.\n\nd. Wakanda forever!\n\nd.

Can\u2019t you see you come from kings and queens? My people perish for a lack of knowledge.\n\n71-99: You are woke AF. You use your third eye to overstand the white supremacist structure and would consider going vegan if it weren\u2019t for the fact that you love pork chops and your white girlfriend can fry the fuck outta some bacon.\n\n100 and above: You are too woke. Instead of polluting your mind with movies about fictional superheroes, you\u2019d rather read about real-life things like how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention injected us with AIDS and fills our television programs with subliminal messages that turn us into transsexuals. You have your own personal copy of the Willie Lynch Letter and the gay agenda.

That was a rhetorical question! But just in case you don\u2019t, Ruben won American Idol in 2003, back when that actually mattered, and then later that year released his first album, Soulful, which went platinum. Soulful\u2019s most popular single was \u201cSorry 2004.\u201d Which was a fucking genius song in both conception and execution.\n\nWhy? Well, first, the audacity of a pre-emptive nonapology. In the song, he acknowledges fucking up so much in 2003 that he has used up his apology quota, and since he\u2019s going to do better next year, here\u2019s his apology for the entire year. Which could either be interpreted as \u201cI\u2019m tired of saying I\u2019m sorry, so I\u2019m gonna stop doing fuckshit\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tired of saying I\u2019m sorry. So here today, in 2003, is my sorry for all of 2004. \u2019Cause I just ain\u2019t saying that shit anymore, b.\u201d This is some Jedi-level gaslighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut also, THIS SONG APOLOGIZING FOR 2004 WAS INCLUDED ON AN ALBUM THAT WAS RELEASED IN 2003! This is like a nigga named \u201cTaco Bell\u201d working at Taco Bell.\n\nUltimately, what Ruben wants in the song is a relationship do-over, where sins of the past are forgotten and they\u2019d be able to start fresh. Songs like this\u2014which make up maybe 67 percent of all relationship-related R&B, blues and country tracks\u2014resonate with people because, well, who hasn\u2019t fucked up and wanted to be able to hit a reset button and start anew? Who hasn\u2019t wished for a convenient do-over where you could treat life like an Etch-a-Sketch board and shake it for a new beginning?\n\nAnyway, before I went to bed Sunday night, I read a statement from Kevin Spacey (whom I\u2019d just watched two days earlier in Baby Driver), in which he acknowledged an allegation that he made a sexual advance against a teen by coming out as a gay man, which is like being accused of murder and coming out as a pescatarian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, Monday afternoon, I attempted to follow the labyrinthic network of lies and deceit and whiteness emanating from the president and the people connected to him.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence.

We\u2019ve had a good run here, you and I, over the past couple of years, sharing humorous tomes of blackness and mutually participating in one of the best inside jokes the internet has to offer in the form of Very Smart Brothas. But alas, I fear that my latest offense to the cause of the woke may have been a step too far for even you, dear reader, to let slide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI stand before you today like Jimmy Swaggart to his congregation and ask you for your mercy. I beg you for your understanding. My plea is that you hear me out and allow me to continue to stay in your woke graces henceforth and forever more while you concurrently accept my deepest apologies for my offense. I am so, so very sorry.\n\nThe other night, I took my children to see Santa Claus.\n\nBefore we get too far into the offense, let me start off by explaining how we got here. You see, I hate Christmas. Like, it\u2019s genuinely my least favorite time of year. I hate the cold, I hate the songs, I hate the manufactured generosity that compels me to buy shit for people I don\u2019t really care about, I hate eggnog (because eggnog is basically Satan\u2019s snot), and I hate the very special holiday episodes of TV shows that are topical now but look stupid running in the middle of summer when they go into syndication. I hate it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife, on the other hand, is a bona fide holiday junkie. She eats this Christmas shit up. She decorates the house, bakes the cookies, plays the music, wraps the presents, goes to the parties and wears the fucking sweaters. She\u2019s all in with the cult of Christmas freaks who come around once a year being all merry and shit when you wish they\u2019d all go the holly-jolly hell away. I personally can\u2019t stand it, but there was nothing about Christmas in the wedding vows, so technically, she\u2019s within her rights.\n\nBut as they say, opposites attract, and over the years we\u2019ve worked through our Christmas differences. She decks the halls and I go fa-la-la along with it.\n\n\n\nSince we\u2019ve had kids, I\u2019ve softened my once hardline holiday stance. Children do that with a lot of things, but with Christmas, it\u2019s a big deal because kids really give you context as to why the holiday is so special. Toys. For those of us in the throes of the juvenile playthings-industrial complex, Christmas is basically the one time of year that you know you\u2019re gonna spend a fuckton of money, but it\u2019s also a carrot you can dangle over your children throughout the rest of the year to get them to do things like wash the dishes, clean their rooms and stop trying to stab their sister. That\u2019s all good, but the JPIC also comes with a problematic mascot: Santa Claus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m kinda in a complicated relationship with Santa Claus. On the one hand, I work like a dog all year long to buy the presents that go under the Christmas tree. If you know me, you know I take a certain degree of pride in the work I do, and I especially enjoy sharing the fruits of my labor with my family. I genuinely enjoy seeing them happy, so I bust my ass to make sure I can provide the kind of happiness that money can, in fact, buy.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s especially troubling to me that, after all the work I\u2019ve done to make sure everyone gets exactly what they wanted for Christmas, I\u2019m supposed to cede the credit to some random fat white dude who a) didn\u2019t do shit and 2) doesn\u2019t even exist. As a former barbershop and corner-store Five Percenter, I know this is a clear violation of the \u201cshow and prove\u201d as well as the \u201cmystery god\u201d postulations. By accepting Santa Claus into our family, I\u2019m personally undermining the wokeness that I\u2019m trying to foster in our home by allowing a false avatar of Eurocentric benevolence to occupy a position of significance and respect, superseding me as a parent in delivering to my children that which they have asked for.\n\n\n\nBut on Monday night, there we were: at Macy\u2019s (see: Marshall Field\u2019s in Chicago) in front of the false temple that is Santaland, preparing to codify my 5-year-old\u2019s already cultish beliefs while offering a new worshipper to the red-suited charlatan in the form of my 11-month-old. As we approached the bearded fraud, I could feel the weight of all of the late-night HBCU dorm conversations, Brand Nubian lyrics and DeRay Mckesson tweets hanging around my neck as if to offer me one last moment to grab my children, turn away and run from that den of jolly chicanery. But I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI froze and, in a moment for which I shall repent eternally, I sat my little beautiful girl on that stranger\u2019s lap, asked her to gaze deeply into his eyes and then said: \u201cTell Santa that you\u2019ve been a good girl this year so he\u2019ll bring you all the toys that you want.\u201d\n\nIn that moment, I had given in to (borrowing the words of the apostle Damon Young) Darth Santa.\n\nWe took pictures. We ate dinner. We went home. All the while I knew that, even though I was surrounded by a happy family, I had given up so much of myself that evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s any lesson to be learned here, it\u2019s that Kwanzaa really needs a mascot.", "keywords": ["santa", "know", "holiday", "work", "act", "parenting", "im", "christmas", "children", "shit", "white", "unwoke", "sorry", "weve", "really", "kids", "taking", "hate"], "polarity": 0.027118822735705855, "subjectivity": 0.5936634433387681},

To do so, she constructed what may actually be the stupidest word problem ever created\u2014one that hinged on reporters and beer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not a word problem worth repeating because it\u2019s extremely convoluted and hinges on several factual errors: that drunk reporters know how to do math (most sober ones don\u2019t), that a reporter would have enough energy after settling the bill that she would start arguing over her savings in comparison with her colleagues (what kind of assholes are these reporters?), or that 10 reporters living and working in Washington, D.C., would only spend $100 at a bar.\n\n\n\nDid Someone Say Clinton?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now for the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: when Sanders has to address the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought against former Trump aides Manafort and Gates, as well as former Trump junior foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea.\n\nFrankly, I think this is Sanders\u2019 favorite part. Watch as she proverbially clutches her faux pearls in faux-righteous anger and asks, But why aren\u2019t we talking about Hillary, though?\n\n\u201cThe real collusion scandal, as we\u2019ve said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,\u201d Sanders said, evoking notable criminal investigator O.J. Simpson (emphasis mine).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence [the election],\u201d Sanders continued.\n\n\n\nHuh. Let me shuffle through my papers a bit here\u2014and by papers I mean these stacks of credit card offers that I hold on to as if they were my damn dowry.\n\nOh yes, funny how nann one member of the Clinton campaign has been charged by a federal prosecutor with conspiracy against the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI Don\u2019t Know Her\n\nGet ready\u2014the White House is basically turning into one big Mariah Carey IDontKnowHer.gif.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked directly about Papadopoulos\u2019 specific relationship to Trump and his campaign, Sanders tried to distance him from the administration.\n\n\u201cIt was a volunteer position,\u201d Sanders said, making the former policy adviser sound like a teen doing a Habitat for Humanity project on spring break.\n\n\u201cNo activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign,\u201d Sanders continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManafort has pleaded guilty to making a false statement but has entered pleas of not guilty for the higher charges, including, once again, conspiracy against the whole-ass country. But as the Washington Post notes, even though Papadopoulos is a smaller fish than Manafort, his plea deal is the game changer here because it means he\u2019s actively cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nAs much as Sanders wants to play down the former Trump campaign policy adviser as though he were some transfer student who showed up for one group project meeting and dipped, that plea deal indicates otherwise. You know who receives plea deals?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople who got the dirt and are ready to dish that shit.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["know", "tax", "sarah", "lowlights", "campaign", "playbook", "conspiracy", "houses", "sanders", "trump", "white", "washington", "away", "reporters", "word"], "polarity": 0.09598364598364593, "subjectivity": 0.4353204665704665},

We all have a friend who has pressed pause on their bootleg DVD of Hidden Colors long enough to explain why they aren\u2019t interested in seeing the movie Black Panther because they know how Hollywood poisons the minds of our people, and what we need to do is stop dreaming about vibranium and invest our resources in uplifting our community.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of explaining how you just wanted to see some fictional cool shit with black people on the screen the same way white people get to see Harry Potter, Star Wars and The Passion of the Christ (yes, a Caucasian Jesus is more fantastical than a broom-riding white witch-boy or an evil Jedi with asthma).\n\nYou could engage in an extended argument with your friend, explaining that if black people weren\u2019t capable of separating fiction from reality, we\u2019d be waiting for Blade to kill Donald Trump, believe that the Civil War was about the North\u2019s unwillingness to serve iced tea, and think that Martin Luther King Jr. was a timid little Southern preacher who helped change the minds of the tiny percentage of white Americans who simply wanted to sit in the front seats on public transportation.\n\nLuckily, instead of listening to all that noise, you can just present your faux-tep friend with this short quiz to determine whether or not they are too woke for Black Panther.\n\n1.

T\u2019Challa\u2019s alter ego.\n\nc. A flawed character caught between doing what\u2019s right for his people and owning up to the responsibility of his powerful gift.\n\nd. An attempt by the white supremacist gay agenda to feminize black boys by making them wear tight clothes and ostentatious jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Which of these schools is fictional?\n\na. The Wakanda Girls School for Science and Technology.\n\nb. The Dora Milaje Institute for Self-Defense.\n\nc. The Frederick Douglass/Killmonger Academy for Black Boys.\n\nd. Morehouse.\n\n5. Erik Killmonger:\n\na. Is a well-rounded antagonist who inspires sympathy while still playing the villain.\n\nb. Needs to put some shea butter on those chicken pox bumps.\n\nc. Wouldn\u2019t have been so angry if he had been invited to the family reunion and met his cousins a long time ago.\n\nd.

Can\u2019t you see you come from kings and queens? My people perish for a lack of knowledge.\n\n71-99: You are woke AF. You use your third eye to overstand the white supremacist structure and would consider going vegan if it weren\u2019t for the fact that you love pork chops and your white girlfriend can fry the fuck outta some bacon.\n\n100 and above: You are too woke. Instead of polluting your mind with movies about fictional superheroes, you\u2019d rather read about real-life things like how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention injected us with AIDS and fills our television programs with subliminal messages that turn us into transsexuals.

What did she do? She doubled and tripled down on it. She went so far as to change her name to Nkechi Diallo, while some of you are running around with names like Ashley and Donald. I ... I don\u2019t even know what else to say. Except for never go Eric Ben\u00e9t. You see what I did there? Probably not. Let\u2019s move on.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Rachel\u2014her mama named her Rachel, I\u2019m gon\u2019 call her Rachel\u2014is broke, practicing for the Trollympics or just plain ol\u2019 bored and bought a nice new starter DSLR camera and a quote book, but she has decided to offer herself up as tribute to the comedy gods by putting together and dropping a calendar for 2018 featuring provocative (and slightly awkward) photos of herself and quotes like \u201cStay woke & change the world. You never know when an important opportunity will arise.\u201d I can see you all rushing to RachelDolezal.com right now to buy your own copy. Kidding! Why so serious?!\n\n(Also, the \u201cShop\u201d on her website includes items for sale that you\u2019d find at that local store in your mall that also sells black-Greek-letter-organization paraphernalia and those bad black paintings that everybody\u2019s grandma has a few prints of; it includes \u201cGimme Some Sugar Lollipops,\u201d \u201cMelanin Spectrum Dolls\u201d and \u201cShine On Soy Candles.\u201d)\n\nNow, my first instinct is to point and laugh with pure amusement at the traveshamockery that is this woman\u2019s bag since we all came to know of her existence a few years ago. Who in their right mind would make such a purchase, and for why? Does she have actual fans? Is anybody jackin\u2019 their jollies to Rachel Dolezal and just needed 12 months of pictures to do so? Like, what\u2019s a good reason for any single soul to make this $18.99 purchase?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurns out, I can think of 10 reasons to buy this calendar as part of your Chrimmuh shopping.\n\n1. It\u2019s an amazing conversation starter.\n\nImagine having this calendar hanging up in your home, office or brothel. Who isn\u2019t going to say something about it? Either folks know who she is and will wonder why you have it, or not know who she is and wonder why you have this mediocre white woman with locs performing bad implied lust with nonsensical quotes attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe calendar, or at least the samples she made available, is reminiscent of people I hate most on Instagram who take thirst-trap pictures of themselves in thongs and pasties, then attach some fake-deep inspirational caption telling you to be your best self and love Jesus.\n\n2. It could be a conversation starter ... that\u2019s also a doorstop.\n\nHear me out. On Amazon.com, doorstops range from $3.95 to $24.95, but I mean, those are the ones you expect to see. What if you put this under a door and somebody comes in and sees it? Of course, they\u2019re going to look down and say, \u201cBruh, is that motherfucking Rachel Dolezal on your floor keeping the door open?\u201d Just saying. Think about it. It\u2019s probably meta or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you\u2019ve got a thing for white women, this kills two birds with one stone.\n\nHey, black man, you get to buy a calendar of a white woman, but she has locs and swears that she\u2019s a black woman on the inside. And again, her name is Nkechi now, legally. Sure, you love you some white women, but you get to act like you managed to find the blackest one out there. She\u2019s even a playable card in the race-centric game Trading Races, where the goal is to debate the blackest person in the deck. That\u2019s a win-win.\n\n4. It\u2019s a great gag gift.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t laugh and grant the room an elongated \u201cNiggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\u201d upon receiving this gift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. At $18.99 it might make the best Secret Santa or White Elephant gift of all time ... as long as nobody has to divulge what came from whom.\n\nHow annoyed would you be if you pulled this gift? On the flip side, if you work in a white office, it might be hilarious and telling to see how folks respond to this calendar.\n\n6. It\u2019s also a perfect petty gift. I believe in petty.\n\nYour sister has been acting better than other people? Cool. Catch this December Dolezal, b. Your cousin claims nobody ever gets him anything even though he\u2019s been getting everything he ever wanted from Grandma since he was born? Cool. Catch this January Dolezal, LeDerrick-Joseph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. If you want to support the self-identity-over-everything movement, here\u2019s your chance.\n\nBuying this calendar can prove just how committed you are to living your truest self and not letting society or anybody else tell you who you are, Moana. No one goes beyond the reef? Rachel Dolezal goes beyond the reef.\n\n8. Because maybe you don\u2019t actually find her that problematic.\n\nThere are some folks who actually don\u2019t have a problem with her or her antics. They don\u2019t view them as antics at all, in fact, but as a woman living her truth. Well, this is how you can show your real support for her. Nothing says \u201cI support this motherfucker\u201d like paying for a whole-ass calendar of that person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The calendar is filled with birthdays and black-history facts.\n\nIf nothing else, you have to appreciate her dedication to this plight and life of hers. This calendar adds to that, since I doubt there are any white-history alternative facts in it. If you\u2019re one of those people who are like, \u201cI have to respect her dedication,\u201d then here\u2019s a perfect item for you!\n\n10. It can be turned into a family bonding experience.\n\nYou, as a family, can split the $18.99 (plus HOLY SHIT, SHIPPING IS $10) and pass the Dolezal calendar around the family as a running gag for the whole year. I don\u2019t know how much bonding it creates, but at the very least, the jokes will fly on the first of each month, and what\u2019s better than one billionaire? Two. Especially if they come from the same hue as you.

Just this afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s primary propagandist and agent of misinformation, declared today to be too soon to talk gun control before pivoting, midbreath, to blow a Chicago dog whistle. There have been and will continue to be very passionate rebukes of Sanders and Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association and white maleness, and very smart people will offer possible solutions to this unsolvable problem.\n\nAnd then, when another mass shooting happens next month or next year or tomorrow in Austin, Texas, or Youngstown, Ohio, or Durham, N.C., or Denver, the same thing will happen again. Nothing will change.\n\nIt\u2019s with this context that I\u2019m left to wonder exactly how many white people would have to die in a mass shooting before America\u2019s collective will to stop this from happening again would surpass its zeal and yearning for guns. Which number would serve as the critical mass?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know, after Sandy Hook, that the deaths of 20 young schoolchildren weren\u2019t enough. And if the senseless murder of children affects us, I don\u2019t know, 10 times as much as the murders of adults do, then we can extrapolate and presume that 200 people murdered in a mass shooting wouldn\u2019t be enough, either.\n\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s no accident that the headline of this piece includes a qualifier for whiteness. It\u2019s there because we know exactly how many black people would have to die in a mass shooting before America decided to give a shit about gun control. If there are roughly 40 million black people here, then roughly 40 million black people would have to die. Then, of course, the NRA\u2019s need to be a source of white identification\u2014and the aggressively white affinity to possess the ability to stockpile killing machines\u2014would no longer exist. No need for night-lights if all the bogeymen are dead.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, what is the number? 250? 500? 600? 1,300? 2,200? 57,000?

Nineteen women have come out to claim that before the president became the president, he was sexually inappropriate. The claims of these 19 women run the gamut from unwanted touching to unwanted kissing, and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, a champion of women\u2019s rights and reportedly her father\u2019s moral compass on these issues, believes her father when he says that all of these women\u2014all 19 of them\u2014are lying.\n\n\u201cI believe my father,\u201d Ivanka Trump said Sunday in an exclusive interview with NBC News, claiming that the question posed to her was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know my father. So I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019m unclear how Ivanka Trump believes that the question was inappropriate. She\u2019s in the White House because her father wanted her there. She prides herself on being a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d who helps her father make difficult moral decisions. In fact, Ivanka Trump took her job as Trump whisperer so seriously, she took an official unpaid role in the White House just so she could do that.\n\nI think that these people\u2014and by \u201cthese people,\u201d I mean these Trumps\u2014don\u2019t understand the nature of this public position.

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester.

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["wanna", "getty", "images", "marvel", "wakanda", "veronica", "style", "styles", "wear", "look", "film", "black", "love", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

We have to sit back and be honest with each other. The cops have made some mistakes; that don\u2019t give us the right to riot and shoot cops. We need the cops, especially in the black community. We as black people, we\u2019ve got to do better.\n\nSir, are you assuming that all protesters are rioting and shooting cops? Because that's not what's happening. There's more:\n\n\n\nThere is some reason why there\u2019s racial stereotypes, [because] some black people are crooks. Some of these black people out there are committing crimes. Let\u2019s don\u2019t sit there and act like all our hands are clean. We never get mad when black people kill each other; well, that always has bothered me. \u2026 I\u2019ve always said we as black people, if you want respect, you\u2019ve got to give each other respect.

We're still not as far as we could be as a nation, but we're in the Oval Office, performing on stages and owning many things because someone boycotted for us.\n\n5. Tyga\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTyga decided to get involved in the police-brutality conversation on Twitter in a series of tweets. He was making valid points about police involved in the shooting of unarmed black people and how he doesn't care whether or not they are innocent and that we need to speak up and vote. Then he made the fatal mistake of tweeting #AllLivesMatter. And black journalist Cory Townes went all the way in.\n\n6. Wendy Williams\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWendy Williams made the HBCU comment heard 'round the world when she said, \"I would be really offended if there was a school that was known as a historically white college.

I should just share why Azealia Banks said she lightened her skin:\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to discuss the cultural significance of skin bleaching anymore because i think that just as African-American people or just as black people in this world, you assimilate.

It\u2019s just a continuation of the falsification of self that comes with being a black person in America. That can extend to speaking clear English or doing really well in academia.

Her personality is infectious, her country Chicago accent is adorable and she's got the kind of energy you want to be around. But then Keke Palmer's Twitter fingers got in the way while she was commenting on #BlackLivesMatter. She said that all lives matter because people are being murdered for religion, too. This is like going to an AIDS rally and asking someone to care because you have Parkinson's. Not the time, Keke, not the time.\n\n11. Pastor Darrell Scott\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDarrell Scott is pastor of the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland and burst onto the political scene last November when he pulled together a group of black pastors who were supposed to endorse Donald Trump for president. The Root\u2019s political editor, Jason Johnson, spoke with Scott, and after he realized how giddy the minister was about flying on Trump\u2019s private jet and the gold-plated seat belts he got to buckle, he knew he was dealing with the worst kind of opportunist\u2014one who's willing to sell his soul for gold.\n\n\n\n12. Justice Clarence Thomas\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is Clarence Thomas so \"sleep?\" Is it because he's a self-hating Uncle Ruckus type, who hates affirmative action and racial quotas, even though one could argue it was a form of affirmative action/a quota system that got him on the Supreme Court? (He didn\u2019t have the record to replace a lion like Thurgood Marshall.) Is it the fact that he never asked a question for, like, 10 years, and always sided with now-deceased super-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on everything? Could it have been what happened with Anita Hill? Or could he be sleep because he said this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corollary of that principle is that human dignity cannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away.\n\n13. Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis guy endorses Donald Trump, and even though he's a former brain surgeon, he's an idiot. Do you remember what Ben Carson said about Harriet Tubman on the $20?\n\n\n\nAndrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt. In honor of that we kick him off of the money. I love Harriet Tubman. I love what she did, but we can find another way to honor her. Maybe a $2 bill.\n\n14. Erykah Badu\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sultry singer is a little more Hotep than she is sleep, but Erykah Badu's series of tweets about young girls and the pedophiles who can't stop gawking at them ruffled many feathers, including those of our associate editor, Kirsten West Savali. Badu placed the responsibility on these young women, telling them that they should dress less sexy. Wait, what?\n\nA couple of her tweets are below, but since then, Badu has woken up a bit more and is now donating funds from her upcoming show to the African American 490 Challenge, a partner of Enough SAID, the Michigan Women's Foundation campaign to raise money to test more then 10,000 rape kits found abandoned in storage at the Detroit Police Department.

Raven-Symon\u00e9\n\nI think Raven-Symon\u00e9 had to be the first black celebrity to declare that all lives matter. It was back in 2015 after then-presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley said that all lives matter at a rally and later apologized, Raven-Symon\u00e9 attempted to back him up, claiming that O'Malley didn't need to apologize. On The View she said this:\n\n\n\nI understand what the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d hashtag means. It came in conjunction with everything that was going on with the police in Ferguson. You have to be sensitive in that statement, but he is right, all lives matter. \u2026 I think you have to open yourself up.

How long do you have to be in one country before you\u2019re that?\n\nAnd then this after a TV host said that Michelle Obama looked like an ape (later, Raven-Symon\u00e9 went on to say that the first lady looked like a cat):\n\n\n\n\"I don\u2019t think he was saying it racist \u2026 Michelle, don\u2019t fire me from this right now, but some people look like animals.

Nineteen women have come out to claim that before the president became the president, he was sexually inappropriate. The claims of these 19 women run the gamut from unwanted touching to unwanted kissing, and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, a champion of women\u2019s rights and reportedly her father\u2019s moral compass on these issues, believes her father when he says that all of these women\u2014all 19 of them\u2014are lying.\n\n\u201cI believe my father,\u201d Ivanka Trump said Sunday in an exclusive interview with NBC News, claiming that the question posed to her was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know my father.

We are members of the first historically black Greek collegiate fraternity and are called line brothers because we joined at the same time. He called with a question that, up until then, I\u2019d not considered. He wanted to know what was the mechanism by which we quantify someone\u2019s degree of wokeness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCan a person be woke in one area but sleep in another?\u201d Good question.\n\n\u201cDoes being woke mean I have to agree with what all other woke folks say should be done about issues in the black community?\u201d My L.B. is smart. I\u2019d expect nothing else from an Alpha man.\n\nHis main point of inquiry centered on the illusive nature of ideas and expectations concerning those we identify as woke. He called me because he knows that as a philosopher of race, I teach, write and think about the intersection of race and public policy. To fully unpack his question, I think we need to first examine the contemporaneous use of the word \u201cwoke\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis the movement for black lives.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay Woke\n\nMerriam-Webster defines \u201cwoke\u201d as the past and past participle of \u201cwake.\u201d The Urban Dictionary says woke means \u201c \u2026 being aware. Knowing what\u2019s going on in the community (Relating to Racism and Social Injustice).\u201d\n\nWhile these definitions are helpful, they do not get to the heart of why I think the notion of being \u201cwoke\u201d has gained so much currency of late.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the civil rights movement, black folks in America enjoyed previously unknown levels of upward socioeconomic mobility. While there have always been class divisions and marginal access to privilege based on skin color inside the community, the one unifying oppression with which all struggled was overt interpersonal racism and blatant institutional bias. With gains achieved in the 1960s and 1970s, many middle-class black folks retreated into suburban comfort while poor and working-class black Americans endured mistreatment and exploitation at the hands of a criminal-justice and capitalistic system that was no less racist than before\u2014only slightly less blatant in its execution.\n\nDuring this time of unprecedented opportunity, complacency set in for many. Indeed, there were always those like Louis Farrakhan, Jeremiah Wright and Cornel West who continued to shine a spotlight on racial inequality, but many\u2014dare I say most\u2014fell asleep and dreamed of individualized prosperity at the expense of communal empowerment. Apathy set in. We thought, \u201cAs long as me and mine are taken care of, then I need not concern myself with the concerns of the community.\u201d The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter changed much of that.\n\n\n\n#BlackLivesMatter\n\nAfter the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter began to be used by activists to bring attention to issues black folks are facing in America. The activists behind the movement for black lives have done more to bring attention to areas of racial inequity than, arguably, any other group of activists in the past 10 years. Things like public education funding, housing segregation, environmental racism and police brutality have become part of the national conversation partly because of the persistence these activists have shown in raising awareness of such issues. Inspired by these activists, public protests began to take place across the country. From marches in Baltimore and Chicago to the near boycott of a football game by players at the University of Missouri, race is once again a topic of public conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the heart of what it means to be \u201cwoke.\u201d The masses of black folks who were lulled to sleep by economic opportunity have now awoken to the fact that race is, and will remain, a central part of the black experience. Yet there is disagreement about who is allowed to be woke and what is expected of those who have now entered into this new existential state of being.\n\n\n\nWho Gets Access?\n\nFor me, being woke means awakening to the pervasive, intersectional insidiousness of white supremacy. This awakening is not limited to people of color. Black folks are not the only ones who needed a wake-up call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouls that inhabit white bodies can be allies and accomplices in the fight against oppression, in the same way that black folks can be agents and accomplices in promoting, promulgating and protecting white supremacy. As my grandmother once said, conjuring Zora Neale Hurston, \u201cAll your skinfolk ain\u2019t your kinfolk.\u201d Meaning that you can inhabit a black body and be an agent of white supremacy. Just ask Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, or any of the thousands of black Americans who are more concerned with white feelings than with black lives and bodies. Black folks don\u2019t have the market cornered on being \u201cwoke,\u201d and there is no agreement about how best to actualize the potentiality of the black community.\n\n\n\nLitmus Test\n\nWhite supremacy frames black intellectualism as monolithic. Put another way, to expect black folks to think the same is an assumption filtered through a white conceptual lens. To quote Kanye West\u2019s \u201cNew Slaves,\u201d white supremacy says, \u201cAll you blacks want all the same things.\u201d But this is not true. Black people may all awaken to the reality of institutional, covert and overt racism and still disagree about what is the best response to those ills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Hotep may respond by longing for a return to a mythological past where black men were unquestioned in their authority and black women knew their place. Black libertarians may say that less government is the answer while maintaining that the invisible hand of capitalism will fix economic inequality. Each of these responses has historical precedent in the black community, and each of these positions needs to be challenged.\n\nFrom W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019 beef with Marcus Garvey to Mary Church Terrell\u2019s disagreement with Mary McLeod Bethune, black Americans have never been homogeneous. We have a rich history of intellectualism, which, almost by necessity, means that we have ancestors who thought deeply and critically and, despite unapologetically loving black people, vehemently disagreed.\n\nThere is no litmus test for being woke. Like the libertarian, you can be aware of racism and fail to see how it intersects with economic inequality. Like the Hotep, you can become aware of the racialized nature of class and still hold to the oppressive ideologies of patriarchy or homophobia. To be woke is to be malleable\u2014one can always be more critical, more empathetic and more sensitive to injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy L.B. and I never fully explicated the idea of \u201cwokeness.\u201d We never figured out who was the arbiter of the concept. The best we could do was deepen our dedication and fight injustice wherever and whenever we found it. Really, that\u2019s the best anyone can do.\n\nLawrence Ware is a progressive writer in a conservative state.

She has acknowledged that her tweets crossed that line and has apologized for doing so. We accept her apology.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contrition followed 48 hours in which White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the \u201cSportsCenter\u201d co-host should be fired, the National Association of Black Journalists stood by Hill\u2019s free-speech rights, and others debated the role of ESPN in the media universe, Trump\u2019s stance toward African Americans, particularly black women, the meaning of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and how the reaction to Hill compared with that accorded others who made controversial statements.\n\nAs reproduced Wednesday by David Mack of BuzzFeed, Hill\u2019s since-deleted Monday night tweets included, \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists\u201d and \u201cTrump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about that in the White House briefing room Wednesday, Sanders said, \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something that I think is a fireable offense by ESPN.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 comments were immediately denounced by journalists, who said Sanders had crossed a line. The White House publicly calling for the firing of a private citizen for expressing her views? Other presidents have complained about reporters in private, but not at a news conference.\n\nIt became yet another threshold crossed by the Trump presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Pete Vernon wrote Thursday in his Columbia Journalism Review newsletter, \u201cThough questions about what journalists can and should say on their personal social media feeds didn\u2019t begin with Trump, his rise \u2014 and the politicization of nearly all aspects of American culture \u2014 have forced the issue. Politico\u2019s managing editor recently waded into this larger controversy when he told staffers that the company discards \u2018dozens\u2019 of job applications over inappropriate or partisan tweets.\n\nVernon added, \u201cHill is hardly the first media figure to associate Trump with white supremacy. Last month, both The New Yorker and The Economist featured covers depicting the president and the white hood of the Ku Klux Klan. Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote that Trump\u2019s \u2018ideology is white supremacy\u2019 in last week\u2019s widely read Atlantic story.\n\n\u201cSo why did Hill\u2019s comments become an issue worthy of an official response from the lectern? In part, because conservative media figures like sentient hot-take Clay Travis and perpetually confused Tucker Carlson made it one. Some journalists suggested Sanders\u2019s response was a deliberate attempt by the administration to distract from bigger issues. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Hill is a black woman did not escape Brittney Cooper, associate professor of women\u2019s and gender studies and Africana Studies at Rutgers University. Cooper noted on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In With Chris Hayes\u201d Wednesday that the Trump White House has also disparaged reporter April Ryan and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., other black women.\n\nHas Trump embraced white supremacy? \u201cThere is something Donald Trump did to get into office that we haven\u2019t seen in 150 years,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhere did she lie?\u201d Jason Johnson, theRoot.com\u2019s political editor who joined Cooper in the segment, asked about Hill.\n\nThe accuracy of Hill\u2019s statements and the fear that racism is being even more normalized were enough for many African Americans to support Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur society abounds with white people who are more likely to be disturbed at being called racist than they are to be disturbed by racism,\u201d Jarvis DeBerry wrote for NOLA.com | the Times-Picayune. \u201cConsequently, people will condemn Hill without even pausing to consider the accuracy of her allegation.\u201d\n\nMoreover, some don\u2019t view the meaning of the words \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d as static. Washington journalist John McQuaid argued on Facebook that \u201cThe commonly-accepted meaning used to refer to people espousing an explicit \u2018whites are superior\u2019 ideology \u2013David Duke, et al. But thanks in part to Ta-Nehisi Coates, a broader definition has gained currency \u2013 the structure of white privilege embedded (often non-explicitly or unconsciously) in institutions and attitudes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs Trump promoting this type of white supremacy? Arguably, yes. But the term is still charged and many/most white people (in particular) are going to equate it saying \u2018you are another David Duke.\u2019\u201d\n\nAndy Borowitz, satirist for the New Yorker magazine, said Trump wouldn\u2019t qualify in any case. \u201cUpbraiding the ESPN anchor Jemele Hill for calling Donald Trump a \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Wednesday that \u201cno one has done more than President Trump to prove that white people are not superior,\u2019 \u201d Borowitz wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Hill\u2019s tweets were red meat for right-wingers who love to hate on ESPN \u2014 and Hill.\n\nOn blacksportsonline.com Tuesday, Robert Littal compiled \u201cA Collection of Tweets Just From Today of Trump Supporters Calling Jemele Hill a Nigger.\u201d\n\nHill is a former columnist at the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cSportsCenter\u201d is an opinion show.

Hill, who is black, and her co-host, Michael Smith, who is also black, frequently discuss black culture \u2014 uncommon for an ESPN show.\n\n\u201cESPN is hardly without conservative representation. Hill\u2019s tweets were posted about an hour before the second broadcast of ESPN\u2019s \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 doubleheader. The analyst for that game was Rex Ryan, who introduced President Trump at a rally last year.

The selflessness and deference to the man of the hour, they said, was the power of Vance.\n\n\u201cEvery single one had something to share about their love for this guy,\u201d said Harris, a recent arrival at Vance\u2019s shop from rival WJLA-TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt says so much about this guy. I\u2019m now shaking in my shoes, \u2018cause I realize what this man meant to this town. It\u2019s humbling to walk down the same hallways.\u201d And Vance did it \u201cjust by being himself,\u201d Harris said.\n\nEight hundred people were at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral Tuesday morning for an invitation-only memorial service for Vance, which was televised on NBC\u2019s owned-and-operated WRC-TV.\n\nVance had become such a local icon that in June his image was unveiled on the outdoor wall of Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, a favorite tourist spot. He spent 48 years at WRC before succumbing to lung cancer July 22 at age 75.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe two-hour service at Washington National Cathedral was as close to a party as you could have in such grandiose surroundings,\u201d Roxanne Roberts wrote Tuesday in the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThere was lots of music, laughter and a guest list of Washington\u2019s broadcasting and political elite: the entire Channel 4 family, of course, plus Gordon Peterson, Paul Berry, Arch Campbell, Chris Matthews, Katie Couric, Willard Scott, Mayor Muriel Bowser, former attorney general Eric Holder and Redskins quarterback Sonny Jurgensen. . . .\u201d\n\nVance was proud of his Philadelphia roots even as he and the nation\u2019s capital embraced each other, but he had more than local significance. An inductee into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame, Vance became an example of the importance of local news anchors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything definitive recently that\u2019s been written about the importance of local anchors,\u201d Mike Cavender, then executive director of the Radio Television Digital News Association, told Journal-isms after Vance\u2019s passing.\n\n\u201cNews research, generally, shows they are among the most trusted components of TV News in terms of trustworthiness and believability\u2026.and are a major reason why local TV news is among the most trusted news sources of them all in the United States. Jim Vance is certainly a classic example of that on so many levels\u2026and his tenure at WRC-TV is a major reason why that station for so long has been at the top of the ratings in DC.\u201d\n\nBowser told the crowd, Vance \u201cdidn\u2019t just deliver the news, he engaged in a conversation with us.\u201d His co-anchor Doreen Gentzler reminded the audience that for all Vance\u2019s comfort in his own skin and other personal attributes, he was a skilled reporter who could edit adeptly on the fly as the Teleprompter rolled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome said afterward that they were surprised that the service was \u201cunapologetically black,\u201d as NBC\u2019s Craig Melvin, the master of ceremonies, described Vance himself. That was no small feat in a town once known as \u201cChocolate City\u201d but where gentrification has eroded that sobriquet. A recent book has rechristened D.C. \u201cCappuccino City.\u201d Yet, as the Undefeated writer Mike Wise said of Vance when the service ended, \u201cHe was a hero to all of Washington.\u201d\n\nThe program featured several of Vance\u2019s red-coated Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers from Cheyney State College in the early 1960s. Led by Kenneth \u201cQP\u201d Hamilton, who first met Vance in 1960, they sang the Kappa anthem. They recalled that the late Ed Bradley, who went on to become the noted \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent, was Vance\u2019s roommate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Moonlighters, a doo-wop group all sporting royal blue ties and dark suits, underscored Vance\u2019s love of that genre \u2014 he and his Cheyney football teammates would sing on the bus ride home after inevitably losing away games. The Moonlighters\u2019 song of choice for this occasion was, \u201cYou Gave Me Peace of Mind.\u201d\n\nThe Howard University Gospel Choir represented the black religious tradition, singing \u201cGoin\u2019 Up Yonder\u201d early in the service.\n\nAnd in a voice reminiscent of Paul Robeson, one listener said, Pastor Wintley Phipps, an education activist and founder of the U.S. Dream Academy, which runs an after-school mentoring program, sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Cheney alum Wendell Whitlock noted, Vance and his buddies could also sing challenging operatic passages.\n\nAs befit the occasion, the speakers told anecdotes. Melvin recalled that on arriving to town, Vance invited him to partake of the best steaks in Washington. The establishment turned out to be a strip club. \u201cHe wanted to see what kind of a guy I was,\u201d Melvin related. \u201cWould I freak out?\u201d Melvin said he didn\u2019t.\n\nLongtime radio and television host Donnie Simpson told of the friendship he and Vance developed, with Vance taking the younger man under his wing. At first Simpson was surprised to find that \u201ctheir anchor desk was as black as the Pittsburgh Steelers defensive line. So this is the Chocolate City I\u2019ve heard so much about?\u201d he mused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Vance never knew Simpson\u2019s father, when the anchor heard of his passing, he flew to Detroit to attend the funeral, returning to D.C. in time for his 6 p.m. news broadcast. \u201cThat\u2019s how you tell a brother you love him,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nLater, Simpson told of turning down a radio contract because \u201csometimes when you grab the money on the table, you leave your dignity on the floor.\u201d Vance signaled his approval during his newscast that night.\n\nJohnny Allen alluded to Vance\u2019s public battles with cocaine addiction, declaring, \u201cyou have to find joy in who you are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaya Angelou once said, \u201cI\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s stepson, Brendon Pinkard, echoed that. Of what he gleaned from anecdotes about his father, Pinkard said, what most came through was \u201chow he made them feel when they were around him. He made them feel as though they were the most important person in the room.\u201d\n\nHamilton, Vance\u2019s Kappa comrade, approved of the service. \u201cEven though he said he didn\u2019t want anything like this, he would have been pleased,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI know. I was his buddy. All he said was \u2018have a big party and drink some tequila.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN\u2019s Michael Wilbon, seated behind former attorney general Holder and his wife, Sharon Malone, also was pleased. \u201cIt was uplifting,\u201d Wilbon said after the service. \u201cI\u2019m not in awe of many people,\u201d as he is constantly around celebrities, Wilbon said, \u201cbut Vance is one.\u201d He cited the hometown hero\u2019s charisma and authenticity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have many heroes.

But she\u2019s still trying to win Trump\u2019s favor and she still has the same villainous image she earned on NBC.\n\n\u201cAccording to four sources in and outside the West Wing, the longtime Trump confidant is isolated inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as she quietly plots against her fellow senior officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cColleagues regularly complain about Manigault\u2019s behavior and work ethic. She frequently derails internal meetings with irrelevant or counterproductive interjections and she\u2019s earned a reputation for attempting to micromanage White House communications operations.\n\n\u201cWhite House chief of staff John Kelly has tried to curtail Manigault\u2019s direct access to the president, as The Daily Beast reported earlier this month. But her continued proximity to Trump \u2014 he speaks with her over the phone, even in the middle of the night \u2014 underscores just how thorny her tenure has been for those tasked with managing the administration. . . . .\u201d\n\nMarkay and Suebsaeng also wrote, \u201cWhite House officials say that during meetings that include Manigault, aides will often take out their smartphones and start messaging each other saying they wished she would stop talking or leave the room entirely. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmarosa Newman, her married name, was also mentioned in a Friday story by Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush in the New York Times.\n\n\u201cAt a staff meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, John F.

They winnowed the list to about 340 who they had confidence would be consistent in fulfilling freelance assignment work.\n\n\u201cDiversify Photo . . . whose website is sponsored by Visura, which itself was founded by Adriana Teresa Letorney, a Puerto Rican media entrepreneur \u2014 will create educational, career development and mentorship programs for photographers of color including college students, Mr. Lewis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe also plans to work with like-minded groups like Women Photograph and Reclaim to push for more diverse perspectives in visual storytelling. Broadening perspectives on race, class and gender is a much-needed challenge to traditional approaches that reinforce \u2018a monolithic point of view,\u2019 said Rhea Combs, curator of film and photography at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. . . .\u201d\n\nThe piece includes this passage about this column\u2019s perspective:\n\n\u201cThe desire to have their voices heard \u2014 and the issues that mattered covered \u2014 has long been of concern in the African-American community, said Richard Prince, the editor of Journal-isms, a website devoted to diversity in journalism. He dates it to the country\u2019s first black newspaper, Freedom\u2019s Journal, whose editors declared in 1827: \u2018We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile a similar impulse led to the creation of influential, black-owned newspapers like The Chicago Defender, it was not enough to influence mainstream media. Indeed, among the sobering findings of the Kerner Commission report after urban unrest in the 1960s was a call for more diversity in mainstream media. [PDF, go to Chapter 15]\n\n\u201c \u2018The industry began to stir itself out of complacency in 1978, when the American Society of News Editors started a staff census of newspapers around the country. When the group found that the percentage of minority journalists in American newsrooms was just 3.95 percent in 1978, it set an industry goal to match the percentage of journalists to the percentage of people of color in the general population by the year 2000.\n\n\u201cThe goal was not met, with the percentage of minorities in newsrooms hovering at between 12 to 17 percent for the last decade. Instead, 2025 was set as the new target. This does not surprise Mr. Prince, who had been an editor at The Washington Post. Despite improvements in some newsrooms during the 1980s and 1990s, progress has stalled as the industry faced economic and structural upheaval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The rise of the internet, and the precariousness of the financial condition of newspapers, caused a lot of the owners to forget all about diversity and say, \u201cWe have to worry about own bottom line and survival,\u201d not realizing that what also was happening at the same time were demographic changes in the population that made diversity even more important because the consumer base was changing,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s supposed to be a majority minority country by 2050, I believe.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn addition to bringing about a cultural shift within companies, there needs to be accountability, too. Mr. Prince echoed the sentiment of many when he said that hiring needs to reflect diversity goals, which may come only through the recognition of the power of one particular color: green. \u2018If you don\u2019t produce diversity among the section that you are responsible for, then your salary is affected,\u2019 Mr. Prince said. \u2018That gets people\u2019s attention.\u2019 . . . \u201c\n\nPablo Manriquez, HuffPost: Award-Winning Latina Photojournalist Chronicles Houston\u2019s Undocumented Hurricane Victims\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNina Garcia Named Editor of Elle Magazine\n\n\u201cNina Garcia will be the next editor of Elle magazine, Hearst announced Tuesday morning,\u201d Matthew Schneier reported Tuesday for the New York Times.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUntil now the creative director of Marie Claire magazine, Ms. Garcia has a name and a tart take on style known to millions in her capacity as a longtime judge on \u2018Project Runway.\u2019 She is also the author of four books on fashion.\n\n\u201c \u2018Look at the issue of empowerment around young working women and the obsession with fashion and beauty.

It\u2019s amazing how children can crystallize your beliefs. For years, I have had these conflicting emotions about how and why I cover football \u2014 particularly the NFL \u2014 but one little boy\u2019s comment cut through the mixed feelings.\n\n\u201c \u2018No,\u2019 I thought. \u2018Hell no. I\u2019ll find a way to destroy the game before you invest your mind \u2014 and definitely your body \u2014 in that misguided sport.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Well, Miles, we\u2019ll see,\u2019 I actually said. \u2018That\u2019s a few years away.

If only it were that easy for the rest of us to transition from America\u2019s favorite troubled pastime.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t merely about the dangers of playing football. My son stirred some deeper thoughts. It\u2019s not that I hate the game; it\u2019s that my distrust of its stewards is at an all-time high, and the NFL leads the way with its clumsy, reckless and self-serving leadership. The problem isn\u2019t one thing. It\u2019s the whole buffet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dread the start of another NFL season. I dread it because obsession is about to drown out concern again. I dread that my work is about to help fuel this obsession. Every sport has issues, but the attention the NFL receives and the money it makes allow for blind arrogance to take over every fall and winter. The NFL has suffered some dings to its popularity, but the damage is minor thus far, barely noticeable, which means the league will go on abusing responsibility and creating an awful example for how to maintain the game.\n\n\u201cThe issues are vast and diverse. They include the NFL\u2019s ongoing failure to commit to a more responsible way to do objective research and protect its players from the effects of concussions and brain injuries caused by playing football. And the limited resources and lack of compassion given to retired athletes who wrecked their bodies to provide entertainment.\n\n\u201cAnd the blackballing of Colin Kaepernick and the overall NFL ambivalence toward its players\u2019 legitimate concerns about equality and social justice. And the confusing and contradictory way that the league disciplines its players, from Tom Brady to Ezekiel Elliott, which consistently shows that it is more concerned about perception than fairness or rehabilitation. And the culture of fighting the players over every dime, which leads to contentious contract negotiations even for stars such as Le\u2019Veon Bell and Aaron Donald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of these grievances fall under one huge, disheartening umbrella: The NFL doesn\u2019t respect humanity.

The committee confirmed Tuesday that Bannon would be given another week to comply with the subpoena.\n\nEmily Hytha, spokeswoman for Rep.

We look forward to having him before the Committee once we can assure that he will be able to thoroughly answer all our questions without concerns regarding the scope of executive privilege.\u201d\n\nThe committee is looking to question Bannon about his time in the White House as well as the presidential transition. Bannon did not answer questions on either topic when he was interviewed last month, instead asserting that he would only answer questions about topics pertaining to when he was chief executive of the Trump campaign. His attorney said that the White House had directed Bannon to protect the president\u2019s right to assert executive privilege.\n\nThat stonewalling has caused the committee to delay his appearance twice.\n\nRep.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

No matter where you live, it\u2019s only two blocks from you, nestled between Tiger Dragon Chinese restaurant and Money2Go Check Cashing Service. While this would seem like a dubious place from which to trace history-changing information, thousands of hours of research revealed the gossip to be strongly rooted in fact. Plus, the tenets of journalism and the principles of Black wisdom dictate that one never argues with the brother giving you a tight fade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI now present the evidence for you to judge for yourself:\n\nThe Hair: The scientific community at large generally agrees that the hardest thing to replicate in opposite-race clones is simulating natural hair. There was a saying en vogue during the 1960\u2019s that has since disappeared: \u201cCan\u2019t no nigga with no perm tell me nothing!\u201d For years, Sharpton has said his hairstyle is a tribute to the late James Brown \u2014 who he says raised him. While it has been the source of much of his deriding and side-eye, it is also the lynchpin of this theory.\n\n\n\nMy team of interns (which was really just me in a bear suit) poked through Sharpton\u2019s garbage for over three months without finding a jar of Sportin\u2019 Waves hair grease, a box of relaxer or even a do-rag. How does his hair stay so straight, you ask?\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\nWhat I do know is that it more than likely the same secret technology used in Donald Trump\u2019s combover patterns. Some scientists speculate that both hairdos exhibit the same hypnotizing qualities of movement that cobras use to render their victims inanimate before filling them with their deadly poison.\n\n\n\nThe Voices: Ask yourself this:\n\n\n\nHave you ever heard Al Sharpton whisper? When was the last time you heard Donald Trump use his inside voice?\n\n\n\nI ran recordings of \u201cThe Donald\u201d speeches and Reverend Al\u2019s alliteration-heavy public statements through a voice spectrum analyzer and the results were fascinating. Both use a combination of hyperbole and volume to emphasize statements that would otherwise fit into the category scientifically termed as bullshit. Sharpton would argue his voice is typical of a Black preacher - which brings up another one of my findings: Although he calls himself \u201creverend\u201d I could not find a degree of divinity in his name, or a single person in the United States who said they attend his church.\n\nThe N-Word: When David Dinkins\u2019 stint as New York mayor was the pinnacle of Black success in the political arena, The Master Race-Baiter Sharpton called him a nigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, Trump has never called anyone that word. Well, at least not publicly. But you can be sure, he\u2019s going to call Obama one.\n\n\n\nSoon.\n\n\n\nThen he\u2019ll be forced to apologize\u2026\n\n\n\nTo Al Sharpton.\n\n\n\nBut it will be over the phone, because\u2026 well\u2026 you know.\n\n\n\nMafia ties: There is an unspoken, but widely circulated rumor that Donald Trump\u2019s construction empire was buttressed by his ties with organized crime in the 1980\u2019s. Similarly forgotten, HBO\u2019s Real Sports aired an undercover video of Reverend Al negotiating a cocaine deal with FBI agents posing as mafia henchmen in 1983. Many people have pointed at this video as evidence why Sharpton can\u2019t be trusted. Not because, like Trump, he was willing to get in bed with the Mafia or distribute cocaine in his own community, but because he is wearing a cowboy hat. Anyone who has a perfunctory knowledge of African American history knows that there are two people you can never trust:\n\n\n\nAny Black man with no facial hair\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026and\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2026A nigga in a cowboy hat.\n\nThey ran identical Presidential campaigns: Let\u2019s be clear. Donald Trump has the same chance of winning a Presidential election as Raven Symone has of winning an episode of Jeopardy. Or Wheel of Fortune. Or the Soul Train Scramble board\u2026 if the answer was \u201cRaven Symone.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump and Sharpton are both trolls used by the illuminati, the Bush political machine or the international hairbrush lobby to gin up the batshit, anti-negro vote. Regardless of party affiliation, the mere sight of these bobble-headed blowhards have been shown by Gallup polls to immediately remind rednecks to take a break from stacking shotguns in their doomsday bunkers and go register to vote.\n\n\n\nAlthough they seem like polar opposites, they accomplish the same goal: Stay in the early primaries and scare some of the reasonable, White people into voting for that Bush guy.\n\n\n\nThey both have time machines: Here is where my research uncovered stunning information:\n\n\n\nMany media-watchers have wondered where Donald Trump finds his beautiful wives. They are supposed \u201csupermodels,\u201d but our research has yet to uncover a magazine with Marla, Ivana or Melania on the cover. We looked everywhere, from Vogue Magazine microfiche to discontinued J.C. Penny catalogues. Nothing. Some physicists have hypothesized that the only explanation is that Trump has access to a time machine which allows him to go back in time, kidnap unsuspecting Czechoslovakian teens and raise them in an oxygen-rich environment in an underground lair hidden beneath the Trump Towers until they are marrying age.\n\n\n\nOthers have posited the same theory as an explanation to how Sharpton\u2019s ability to appear at the side of any wronged Black person with more than three news cameras pointed in their direction seems to defy the space/time continuum. This also explains the cache of people who have been victimized and placed calls to Al Sharpton, only to have him \u201cdisappear\u201d when there wasn\u2019t sufficient media coverage \u2014 even if they had actually been discriminated against. Advanced level microeconomics show that race hustling can be honed to a very profitable enterprise when aided by the ability to teleport.\n\n\n\nOther points of similarity uncovered during this investigation include:\n\n1. A water displacement test revealed their sagging face jowls have identical volume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. 84.029% of the garments in the Trump fashion line are made from the material of Al Sharpton\u2019s old velour track suits.\n\n3. 3-D rendering of the baboon-like white tan circles around Donald Trump\u2019s eyes show they are the same shape as Al Sharpton\u2019s bifocals.\n\nAlthough they worked simultaneously at NBC headquarters, they have never been seen in the same room.\n\n\n\nSo what have we learned?\n\n\n\nThis may be the Watergate of the 21st century. I\u2019m sure the mainstream media will dismiss this article as just another wacko conspiracy theory from the left, but when Trump lets the n-word fly or when you find out who\u2019s actually doing the raping, remember \u2014 I called it, because I see through the lies and obfuscation to present the unadulterated facts.\n\n", "keywords": ["exact", "hair", "person", "research", "sharpton", "trumps", "sharptons", "trump", "investigation", "theory", "really", "black", "al", "donald"], "polarity": 0.09614506869941654, "subjectivity": 0.38970175356044917},

Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger.

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\u201d (video)\n\nTime to Recast World of Decision-Making Machines\n\nFirst, the futurist Amy Webb told the audience of journalists, librarians and foundation managers that they could easily be duped by the ever-growing purveyors of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImages of their faces could be affixed to others\u2019 bodies, their voices to impostors. Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks.

If you think of some of these systems as sort of layered, and each new set of experiments and tools builds on what came before, some of the foundations of some of our modern spoken interfaces come from Philadelphia, but it didn\u2019t come from people \u2014 it came from like, white people in Philly. . . . \u201c\n\nMartin G. Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us. I don\u2019t know if I want such a small group of people making decisions for us all. . . . I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re heading in a direction that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, then there are some easy changes to make. Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder. But that\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve got to get comfortable with. . . . We\u2019ve got to get more comfortable being around people with different ideas. If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined. Based on a Knight Foundation survey of 20,000 respondents:\n\n\u201c45% see a great deal of bias in media coverage today, compared to 25% in 1989\n\n\u201c66% say media doesn\u2019t do a good job separating fact from opinion, compared to 58% who thought the media DID do a good job of that in 1984\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLess than half of Americans can name an objective news source\n\n\u201cAnd yet 84% see the media as key to our democracy\n\nPhoto: George Dalton Tolbert IV\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe people are saying, \u2018News and information are important, but we don\u2019t think you are doing it well.\u2019 This is a place where I believe foundations of all sizes can make a difference. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAt one of the breakout sessions, \u201cCommunity-Focused Journalism: Inspiration and How-to for Funders,\u201d Paul Waters of the Democracy Fund and Molly de Agular of the News Integrity Initiative outlined the role foundations can play in shaping community conversations and how funders can influence news operations. No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged. One of the most prominent was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area last summer. News organizations collectively tackled the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area Media Collaborative will strive to stimulate more intensive and ongoing collaboration among news organizations, most of which are hamstrung by small news staffs and reporting budgets,\u201d Jon Funabiki, executive director of Renaissance Journalism, wrote in August. \u201cIn that sense, BAMC will more closely resemble an earlier Renaissance Journalism initiative called the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (DJC), which brought together nine news outlets. As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues.

Well, Mona Scott-Young if Mona Scott-Young were a 71-year-old white man with the intellectual curiosity of Cujo (after Cujo was shot dead), and the emotional intelligence of a raging teenager who just gulped the last bottle of Four Loko in North America. Yes, that\u2019s it.\n\n\n\nThe longer this disaster of an administration goes on, the more it feels as if anyone who chooses to work at the White House faces risks more akin to a rookie reality-television personality than to any political appointee. Usually, a political staffer may be ousted, but at the very least, they can keep their dignity, marriages and spines intact as they go pimp the speaker and TV-pundit circuit. Not so much with Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, no. You enter this bitch, and chances are you will leave with irreparable damage to your reputation. Of course, it\u2019s unsurprising that a reality-TV-star candidate for president runs his White House as if it were a reality show. And considering that 45 cares only about Twitter, various strains of prejudice, golf and yelling at cable news, I imagine that the man would much rather pit his staff against one another and let chaos ensue than read his daily briefs.\n\n\n\nBut at least reality stars walk away from national embarrassment with a new stream of income by way of a mixtape, liquor line, Instagram boutique or invitation to join the cast of the new season of WE tv\u2019s Marriage Boot Camp. What are newly departed fools of Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration leaving with? I almost feel bad for the newly fired fools, who signed up to serve a disloyal, lazy thot who ultimately plays the shit out of each of them. I say \u201calmost\u201d\n\nbecause when you sign up to work for white supremacy\u2019s equivalent of the D-League, this is what your ass gets.\n\n\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\n\nTo that end, let us begin with Anthony Scaramucci, who somehow managed the feat of being fired before he officially started his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal as communications director especially hilarious is that he was just talking cash-money shit to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all be fired by me,\u201d he said. \u201cI fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I\u2019ll fire tomorrow. I\u2019ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus\u2014if you want to leak something\u2014he\u2019ll be asked to resign very shortly.\u201d The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner because he hadn\u2019t been invited. \u201cReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,\u201d Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: \u201c \u2018Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.\u2019\u201d (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I liked Scaramucci, but I did find him entertaining. He also seemed like someone that, too, enjoys Deion Sanders\u2019 underappreciated bop, \u201cMust Be the Money.\u201d (Beyonc\u00e9 likes it, too.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite part of the New Yorker interview:\n\nScaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock,\u201d he said, speaking of Trump\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u201d (Bannon declined to comment.)\n\nSteve Bannon doesn\u2019t appear to be that limber, but I believe Scaramucci. Not long after this interview ran, chief of staff Reince Priebus resigned, only to be replaced by John Kelly, who immediately decided to fire Scaramucci over the New Yorker interview. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can say the choice to can Scaramucci was rooted in the vulgarity displayed in this now iconic interview, but it likely has more to do with Scaramucci getting too much attention. Lord knows 45 is more like Diana Ross and the Supremes than Destiny\u2019s Child after LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson left and the group made sure every single member got a solo on her songs.\n\nNo. 45 is the only soloist, and all his doo-wop pop pop chicks best not get too loud on the mic. Look what happened to the Mooch: He got too loud and was promptly escorted off the White House premises.\n\n\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we find out that Scaramucci\u2019s wife, Deidre Scaramucci, filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant. A source told Page Six, \u201cWhen [the baby] James was born, he sent her a text saying, \u2018Congratulations, I\u2019ll pray for our child.\u2019\u201d This same source added, \u201cShe\u2019s mad. They aren\u2019t really speaking right now. The [pain] runs deep. [Anthony] tells her she\u2019s not that smart, that he\u2019s out of her league.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Scaramucci was out here praising 45 as if he\u2019d nursed him at birth, he put down his pregnant wife while berating his new co-workers. Now he is single, sold his company for naught and has bragging rights as the shortest-serving incoming White House communications director in U.S. history.\n\nThere have been a few saying they feel bad for Scaramucci. Why? He\u2019s a soulless person who forfeited his beliefs, his marriage and his business in order to attain power. His pursuits led him to bend the knee to a con man who behaved exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, fool. You got exactly what you deserved.\n\n\n\nSean Spicer\n\nThat leads me to now-former White House press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer, who resigned in protest over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring. There are some folks asking whether Spicer will rescind his resignation in light of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Lyin\u2019 Spice knows that when you start singing freedom\u2019s song, you don\u2019t suddenly turn mute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather not see the likes of Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, but him dancing off the beat in a poorly fitting suit sounds a lot less humiliating than continuing to watch Lyin\u2019 Spice go on national television and yell at the press for not believing lies we all know even he doesn\u2019t believe. But if Spicer did take the job, that means Kellyanne Conway would seek a similar slot on a future season, so never mind. I\u2019m not sure what Spicer does next, but he would best serve what\u2019s left of his sanity if he left the White House while he still can.\n\n\n\nSpicer used to be an annoying Republican who toed the party line on the Sunday news shows like every other political hack. Maybe he even believed some of the nonsense he used to spew on TV, but as press secretary, he treated the truth as if it were the finest brand of toilet paper he had ever known, and all he got in return was his boss telling him he looked bad in his suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man got so stressed about daily briefings that he turned the cameras off to avoid further roasting from 45. The man made Spicer\u2019s job a living hell, but what\u2019s truly something is that Spicer resigned over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and ended up being right about him, yet both of them are on the outs. Insert laugh track.\n\n\n\nFarewall, Lyin\u2019 Spice. You got what you deserved, too.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nAnd then there is former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who, even after his humiliation, continues to whisper sweet nothings about that orange bag of stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cThe Final Humiliation of Reince Priebus\u201d:\n\nBut the White House is mired in chaos, and all that Republican power has yet to result in a single major policy achievement. Priebus\u2019s critics view him as the man who sold his party out to Donald Trump. Was it really worth it, I asked? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worth it,\u201d Priebus said, pointing to the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice, regulatory reform, and a healthy economy, though he acknowledged health care remained \u201can obstacle.\u201d \u201cThe president has accomplished an incredible amount of things in the last six months,\u201d he added. \u201cThe future can be great, and the past has been pretty good.\u201d Even in exile, he was still committed to spinning the Trump line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cdick too bomb\u201d? That\u2019s Priebus in this interview. I thought about saying more about Priebus, but if 45 decided to treat him like a \u201cnon-motherfucking-factor bitch\u201d for six months, why rock the boat (work the middle)? Next.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInitially, I was a little fearful of a retired general taking the reins of this White House as chief of staff. After all, the only bright side of this ongoing shit show is that as evil and vile as their political ideologies are, they\u2019ve yet to bring as much havoc to the masses because they\u2019re so bad at governing. In theory, the discipline of a military man might whip these suckers into shape. However, 45 is not going to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaddle Tan Nixon is going to continue being the same messy bitch who lives for drama that he\u2019s always been. As fate would have it, on the new chief of staff\u2019s day one of duty, the Washington Post reported that it was 45 who dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer last year.\n\nSo the characters on The Real Housewives of White Supremacy may change, but 45 is still the NeNe Leakes of the bunch, which means that it won\u2019t be long now before Kelly finds the nearest exit or is told that his services are no longer needed. It\u2019s also just as likely that Boy Wonder Kushner and the Favorite Trump Child will bypass Kelly\u2019s authority every chance they get to offer 45 either bad advice or advice like, \u201cDon\u2019t ban trans soldiers, Daddy,\u201d that\u2019ll only get ignored.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso: Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Steve Bannon\n\nIf I were current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, I\u2019d soon be worried about my sweaters, which are always wrinkled on television, or something else superficial. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 45 decided to eventually treat her the way her brother did that family pet of theirs (since she wants to talk about morality). She may be confidently condescending when speaking to reports, but all she does is stand there and essentially say, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the president about that.\u201d That\u2019s going to get old fast for 45, who prefers his lies with remixes (real remixes like you heard in the 1990s, not the bullshit these children get now).\n\n\n\nLastly, if I were chief strategist Steve Bannon, I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable sitting in my chair (and, I don\u2019t know, sucking my own cock?). Yes, you\u2019re the key to his base, Grand Wizard, but haven\u2019t you already been threatened with firing before? No. 45 gon\u2019 get rid of you in due time, too. He\u2019ll just snuggle next to Sinclair Broadcasting soon after.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep laughing at all of them because it\u2019s the only way to deal with the reality that we\u2019re having to suffer with this incredibly terrible American remake of King Ralph solely because white folks wanted to feel good about being white again. #MAGA.\n\n", "keywords": ["chief", "real", "priebus", "turned", "spicer", "im", "white", "man", "scaramuccis", "yalls", "housewives", "supremacy", "house", "45", "president", "scaramucci"], "polarity": 0.05056435958221671, "subjectivity": 0.4611590393733249},

Nineteen women have come out to claim that before the president became the president, he was sexually inappropriate. The claims of these 19 women run the gamut from unwanted touching to unwanted kissing, and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, a champion of women\u2019s rights and reportedly her father\u2019s moral compass on these issues, believes her father when he says that all of these women\u2014all 19 of them\u2014are lying.\n\n\u201cI believe my father,\u201d Ivanka Trump said Sunday in an exclusive interview with NBC News, claiming that the question posed to her was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know my father. So I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019m unclear how Ivanka Trump believes that the question was inappropriate.

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester. OK, I didn\u2019t go there, I mean, hell, I was smart enough to know not to go there, but I don\u2019t know how he makes this shit up! Also, did you know he has another daughter named Tiffany, but no one ever talks about her?! You, want to know why? Because I\u2019m the dominant Trump offspring! I\u2019m better than Fredo and Vampire Boy and Tiffany\u2014who?

What was different in 2017, more so than any other year in recent memory, was how those polarities were laid bare for everyone else to see.\n\n\n\nIt was the year American streets were crowded with both pussy hats and neo-Nazis. It was the year Confederate monuments were torn from their bases and irate NFL fans cursed at their TVs as black players kneeled en masse. Both \u201ccomplicit\u201d and \u201cfeminism\u201d were designated \u201cwords of the year\u201d (the first by Dictionary.com, the second by Merriam-Webster\u2019s) in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a year that saw the careers of dozens of the world\u2019s most powerful men crash and burn while a man accused of multiple instances of sexual abuse continued to tweet from the Oval Office. It was the year a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. It was the year an alleged pedophile was endorsed by the most powerful man in the free world.\n\nLooking back on the year, no one work sums up the horrors and polarities of the year more than Get Out. It was undoubtedly the movie of 2017: a genre-bending film that managed to feel both timely and overdue. But what makes it not just the film of 2017, but emblematic of it, is best captured in audiences\u2019 divergent reactions to it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Seth Meyers on his late-night show, Allison Williams, who plays the film\u2019s surprise villain, Rose Armitage, describes the reaction she received from white people who had trouble believing that her character, a woman who preyed upon black people, was actually evil:\n\nThey\u2019d say, \u201cShe was hypnotized, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s just evil!\u201d How hard is that to accept? She\u2019s bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she\u2019s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That\u2019s so crazy! And they\u2019re still like, \u201cBut maybe she\u2019s also a victim?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNO! No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence. To break the hypnosis that continues to bind and betray us all.", "keywords": ["virtue", "supremacy", "shes", "women", "innocence", "rose", "armitage", "2017", "white", "violence", "black"], "polarity": 0.06526736813871553, "subjectivity": 0.3853764921946739},

While it\u2019s great to have discussions on how important the film is to the African Diaspora and even the film industry, it can be just as important and fun to talk about certain aspects of it that shed light on how careful and successful director Ryan Coogler was in communicating the many messages that he used Black Panther to deliver.\n\nBecause I enjoy talking about film, and in particular this one, so much, I invited my friend and fellow writer Clarkisha Kent to chat with me about Black Panther and its characters. Below is part of our discussion, which I hope you will enjoy and use it to generate more dialogue with other fans.\n\nCarolyn Hinds: For me the duality within Black Panther is first noticeable with M\u2019Baku and Erik. In the beginning of the film, we\u2019re shown M\u2019Baku\u2019s Jabari ancestors walking away from the other Wakandan tribes because the Jabari were afraid of where technology would take Wakanda, whereas Erik came to Wakanda not only for revenge against T\u2019Challa but to use his country\u2019s tech against him and the rest of the world and create what he calls an \u201cempire\u201d (boy, please).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarkisha Kent: But unlike his ancestors, M\u2019Baku isn\u2019t strictly against the use of technology\u2014he\u2019s just wary of it taking precedence over tradition. And fears that if that were to happen, Wakanda and her people would lose their way.\n\nCH: During the challenge ceremony, M\u2019Baku chastises Shuri (because what he sees as a child who is in charge of all the tech in Wakanda and thereby the future of Wakanda) for showing disregard for traditions that T\u2019Challa himself is taking part in. What I also appreciated about that scene was when T\u2019Challa told M\u2019Baku to yield, he did because he realized that his people still needed his leadership.\n\nNow, what Ryan Coogler did so brilliantly with the challenge scene is that at the climax of the film, T\u2019Challa and Killmonger are practically in the same situation, but instead of yielding, Killmonger chooses death later on instead of yielding to T\u2019Challa. When he said that he\u2019d rather be thrown into the sea instead of being in bondage, I felt like someone had punched me in the gut, and started to cry because that imagery and history is so real to me that I didn\u2019t pick up on his other reason. Over time, I came to realize that in his mind, Killmonger would rather be dead than owe T\u2019Challa anything\u2014including a life. He chose death over possibly being locked up for what he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: This shows that while M\u2019Baku and Killmonger provide very useful foils to T\u2019Challa, M\u2019Baku is willing to put pride aside in regards to T\u2019Challa for the greater good of Wakanda. This is not the case for Killmonger, who shows more and more throughout the movie that not only does he not care for Wakanda and sees it as a means to an end, but he is only in it for himself. Killmonger allegedly operates under the guise of liberation for what audiences assume to be black people all around the world, but we figure out right away that he\u2019s really not for the people when he burns the fricking mystical herb.\n\nEven with their tech, Wakanda is still very in tune with the traditional, the mystical and their ancestors in particular. What he did hurt me because it reminded me of Legend of Korra, where the Avatar at the time (Korra) screws up the whole cycle to where she severs the connection between her and the past Avatars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn burning the heart-shaped herb, Erik does a few things that establish who he really is as a person and what his true motives are: 1) It lets you know right away that he doesn\u2019t respect Wakanda or any of its traditions; 2) It shows us that what M\u2019Baku and his elders feared would happen did, that in a sense the connection to the ancestors would be lost; and 3) By doing what he did, Erik also showed that he doesn\u2019t even care about his own future and lineage.\n\nCH: Yes, it makes you question what kind of leader would someone like Erik be when he has no clear goal for his own personal future. How is he going to create an empire when revenge against T\u2019Challa (for something that [he] had absolutely nothing to do with, by the way) is all that Erik cares about? While the heart-shaped herb gives powers to whoever takes it, I also see it as a literal symbol for their lineage. As we have family trees, Wakandans have the heart-shaped herb, each bloom representing a branch in the royal family. By burning it, Erik is literally saying that \u201cthe family line ends with me; I\u2019m the last.\u201d\n\nHis actions also show that Erik isn\u2019t thinking about the future of Wakanda; he was essentially saying that Wakanda as it was would end with him, and when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an empire,\u201d I was thinking, \u201cIn order to have an empire you have to be thinking about the future.\u201d As the old saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t understand your future unless you understand your past.\u201d Erik didn\u2019t want to understand or respect Wakanda\u2019s past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the differences of M\u2019Baku and Killmonger, there is a similar duality that occurs between Nakia and Okoye. In my opinion Nakia is the better version of Erik in that she advocates for using Wakanda\u2019s tech and capabilities to help the world and those who have been disenfranchised. On the other hand, Okoye, like M\u2019Baku, is about tradition. She\u2019s for respecting and defending the throne with the Dora Milaje.\n\nCK: I\u2019m just fascinated with them because they mirror each other. For Okoye, her love manifests as what she considers to be her duty; to paraphrase her: \u201cI am loyal to the throne, loyal to the country and give my service to the throne no matter what.\u201d You can put a cactus on the throne, and Okoye would yield to the cactus [for] this reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Now, I had to question what Okoye said. How can you swear fealty to someone just because they\u2019re sitting in a chair, especially when it\u2019s obvious they are possibly unhinged? Yes, the throne is important, but it\u2019s what it symbolizes that really matters.\n\nThis particular plot point reminded me of Donald Trump, and as I sat there in the cinema, all I could think was, \u201cDon\u2019t be like the GOP, Okoye.\u201d You have to see the person you\u2019re serving for what they really are, especially when they\u2019re not fit for the position, and thankfully, she saw Killmonger for what he was in the end.\n\nFor Nakia, her love manifests in helping everyone. Whereas to me the Dora Milaje is about helping one, while Nakia\u2019s personal philosophy is \u201cone for all,\u201d and the perfect example of this was shown in our introduction to Nakia. In showing her helping young girls who were held hostage in a caravan by men (who I believe were representative of Boko Haram), we learn that she will put her own life on the line to help others who are in danger, even if they\u2019re not Wakandan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a line that Okoye says after T\u2019Challa \u201cdies,\u201d that her \u201cduty is to serve Wakanda,\u201d and Nakia said her \u201cduty is to save Wakanda,\u201d and I said, \u201cLadies, it is literally one and the same.\u201d But to Okoye and Nakia, they saw saving and serving as two separate actions.\n\nCK: This comes to a head when Okoye sees T\u2019Challa is still alive later in the film, and she thinks that that is enough for everyone to realize the challenge is not over and that everyone would yield to that tradition. But when Erik basically says that he ain\u2019t \u2019bout that challenge life, she sees that tradition isn\u2019t going to be enough in this situation to fix it because this fool doesn\u2019t care about tradition. And she then decides that \u201cI\u2019m gonna save my country, too.\u201d\n\nWith all of the talk about claiming and protecting thrones, I drew parallels to Game of Thrones. People who love Game of Thrones will make the connection between the dilemma that Jamie faced when the Mad King was on the throne. It\u2019s one of these things where technically, as the Kingsguard, he should\u2019ve been 100 percent down with the Mad King no matter what, but after seeing all that the Mad King was doing, he just said, \u201cFuck it, you\u2019re corrupt, so you gotta die.\u201d So with that in mind, I wondered what would\u2019ve happened in the middle of the movie if Okoye just said \u201cFuck it\u201d as well prior to finding out T\u2019Challa was alive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Following on the GoT reference: Killmonger reminds me of Cersei; they both want the throne but actually know nothing about ruling. Cersei has proven on multiple occasions that she\u2019s not fit to rule, doesn\u2019t respect the position and also doesn\u2019t engender respect from others.\n\nCK: Cersei literally blamed the Dothraki for the lack of food her people had, and I wanted to know how they were even connected and what do they have to do with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Essentially, she pulled a Donald Trump\u2014blame everybody but yourself, which is again like Killmonger, and that\u2019s one of my biggest issues with him. Killmonger wants to rule; he \u201cwants it all,\u201d but my question was: What\u2019s his endgame? How are you going to improve the economy? Once the wars he helps to start are over, people will be starving and will need aid. What is his plan to provide food?\n\nHe says he wants to liberate, which is what people are getting all caught up in, but you can\u2019t \u201cliberate\u201d unless you have a plan of what your end goal for liberation is. There\u2019s a line from a Bob Marley song that goes, \u201cRelease yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds,\u201d and to me, Erik has himself so enslaved mentally with the idea of revenge that he can\u2019t see past it.\n\nOn the contrary, with T\u2019Challa, I\u2019ve been seeing people say in tweets that he discredited what Nakia was saying, but then listened to what Killmonger said. But that\u2019s simply not true. The way I see it, T\u2019Challa understood what Nakia was saying, but initially he just wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to deal with what she was asking. I\u2019m not sure how often T\u2019Challa leaves Wakanda, but in the MCU, the first time we see him outside Wakanda, T\u2019Chaka dies, and when Nakia is telling him that the world needs help, T\u2019Challa is still grieving for his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: Wakanda has been so insular for so long, and the moment that his father tries to get involved in the outside world, he dies. I can understand why T\u2019Challa is like, \u201cYou know what? The ancestors had the right idea all along. Maybe there are benefits to staying isolated.\u201d He then goes from burying his father to dealing with the whole Klaue situation, so he hasn\u2019t had time to breathe. Give the man a break. He\u2019s been through a lot, and it\u2019s why his anger at T\u2019Chaka is so palpable.\n\nPhoto: Marvel\n\nCH: That\u2019s why I love what Rachel Morrison did with the visuals, because she translated T\u2019Challa\u2019s emotions beautifully. When T\u2019Challa first sees his father in the ancestral plane, everything is all hazy and dreamlike, with the shades of blues and purples, the colors synonymous with Black Panther. But then when T\u2019Challa becomes disillusioned with the mythology of the former panthers, he took off his purple-tinted glasses\u2014so to speak\u2014and sees his ancestors for what they were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you notice in that scene, they\u2019re in their human forms, and this took place during the daytime, so he finally sees them for who they were and not mythological panthers, as in the first scene. I have to give credit to Rachel for that because it was subtle, but very powerful. The way I see it, what was done in the night was revealed in the light. T\u2019Challa no longer saw them as being on a pedestal; they were level and on the same ground as him.\n\nCK: And perhaps those ancestral scenes in themselves function as the perfect extended allegory for the film. With all the dichotomies at play in the film, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in hidden and/or deeper meanings. But in the end, this film at every level functions as an example that there is always going to be a different way of looking at things or a different way of doing things. And oftentimes, things that we may see as oppositional may, in fact, be two sides of the same coin. Of course, this would mean that both Black Panther, life and blackness at large is layered and ultimately complex.

Keep in mind that this was the first time in weeks that the White House had allowed the press briefing to be televised. I\u2019m not sure when the press became such wimps, but one reporter, Brian Karem, a correspondent for Playboy, had enough.\n\n\n\nSuckabee was pushing as proof of fake news the resignation of three CNN employees over their work on a Russia-Trump investigative piece. Now, CNN stated in announcing the resignations that the story didn\u2019t meet its journalistic standards, but there has been no proof that the story itself was false. But in any case, Karem had heard enough, and in a room full of media, he interrupted Suckabee to accuse her of making inflammatory remarks. Watch the heated exchange below:\n\nIn that moment, Karem stood up not only for CNN but for all the journalists who have been dying for someone to push back against this fake-news narrative the White House \u201ctrumpets\u201d whenever stories are written of which President Vladimir Trumpelstiltskin doesn\u2019t approve.\n\nOn Wednesday, Karem told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski that the confrontation was a long time coming.\n\n\u201cWe are bullied and browbeaten every day, and I pretty much have had enough of it,\u201d Karem said. \u201cThere\u2019s really only two ways to deal with a bully: turn them into your friend, [but] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a possibility, or let them know exactly what\u2019s up, and you\u2019re not going to take the bullying anymore. We can\u2019t take the bullying anymore. It\u2019s undermining the Fourth Estate, it\u2019s undermining the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nKarem added that the president\u2019s relentless pursuit of the fake-news narrative was, at its core, an assault on democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe reporters I know in that room\u2014even Breitbart, those people are responsible; for the government to sit there and undermine, essentially, what is an essential checks and balances in the system, it\u2019s a bit disheartening,\u201d Karem said, Raw Story reports. \u201cIt\u2019s unnerving. I can\u2019t take it anymore, it\u2019s nuts.\u201d\n\nKarem is right. Since Russia handed Trumpelstiltskin the election, the president has bullied the media, and his tactics have proved to be effective. When it was announced that press briefings wouldn\u2019t be televised, the media did not protest the decision; instead they complied with the White House\u2019s request and bitched about it on social media.\n\n\u201cWhat it speaks to is dissolving the independent media, and that\u2019s what\u2014it\u2019s trying to co-opt the media, make us, if we don\u2019t print what they want or broadcast what they like, we\u2019re automatically fake media,\u201d Karem said on Morning Joe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarem added that the fake-news narrative is arguably one of the only strategies the White House has, and it\u2019s been consistent.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few strategies i\u2019ve seen from this White House, and it has been ongoing,\u201d Karem said. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t lump everybody in with that. They\u2019ve done some things that are incredibly open\u2014adding Skype to their press briefings, bringing in members of the Cabinet for briefings\u2014but at the same time, when the president of the United States, even [Wednesday] morning, is tweeting out \u2018fake media,\u2019 and telling us we\u2019re the enemy of the people, he\u2019s enflaming the very people who got him in office. He\u2019s speaking to his base, and he\u2019s trying to undermine the very essence of what we do, and that\u2019s not good for this republic, it\u2019s not good for this country.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["rick", "school", "yes", "nra", "gov", "enforcement", "trump", "scott", "health", "gun", "ranks", "celebrate", "proposed", "law", "mental", "shouldnt", "florida", "weapons"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

But the reality is that Black Panther\u2019s female characters are engaged in a much more nuanced, and ultimately more interesting, dialogue about the film\u2019s ideas.\n\nThough he\u2019s the film\u2019s titular hero, T\u2019Challa is, in a lot of ways, kind of a cipher for the audience throughout most of the film. We\u2019re introduced to Wakanda through his eyes at a point in his life where he\u2019s unsure of exactly who he is, both as a hero and as a king; these are pieces of his identity that he looks to the women closest to him to help him work through and understand. In that very first scene where we meet Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), T\u2019Challa\u2019s quite literally gone out of his way to interrupt her mission abroad specifically because he needs her support in the wake of his father\u2019s recent death and his impending coronation.\n\nWhile Nakia and T\u2019Challa\u2019s romantic past undoubtedly factors into why he seeks her out, it\u2019s important to read somewhat deeper into T\u2019Challa\u2019s impulse to immediately reach out to Nakia, given her ideas about what role Wakanda plays in the world in the wake of T\u2019Chaka\u2019s death.\n\nUnlike Killmonger, who comes to argue in favor of a radical, expansionist Wakanda that subjugates the rest of the world for its own good and as a kind of payback for centuries of black disenfranchisement, Nakia champions a more complicated and humanitarian sort of diplomacy. It\u2019s telling that Nakia is the person we see T\u2019Challa conferring with at such a pivotal moment in Wakanda\u2019s political history, because by the end of the film, it\u2019s her perspective that T\u2019Challa chooses to see things from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, because T\u2019Challa is something of a cipher, he doesn\u2019t exactly spend much of the film trying to argue against Nakia. Rather, he listens to what she has to say, takes her words to heart, and asks that she stay close to him as they embark on Black Panther\u2019s larger epic adventures around the globe. Here, it\u2019s T\u2019Challa\u2019s respect for Nakia (and all of the women around him) that makes him strong and introduces us to the chorus of powerful voices that do, in their way, clash with Nakia\u2019s.\n\nThe ideological gap between Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira), the general of the royal bodyguard/special forces unit the Dora Milaje, is without a doubt the source of Black Panther\u2019s most narratively-fascinating and well-thought-out debate. In them, we see the merits of both sides of the argument about whether Wakanda should reveal itself to the world. Nakia, who spends time out in the larger world because of her duties as a Wakandan spy, intimately understands the potential her nation has to become a transformative agent of empowerment and liberation for countries in need. Okoye (and to a lesser extent Queen Mother Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett) is the staunchest of traditionalists whose beliefs represent the reality that Wakanda\u2019s might is the direct result of their isolationism. Where Killmonger sees Wakanda as having committed an unforgivable sin by closing itself off from the world, Okoye understands the fundamental necessity of the country\u2019s secrecy.\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to argue that Wakanda could and should have intervened in the world\u2019s affairs long before the events of Black Panther, the difficult truth of the matter is that Wakanda was not always and perhaps still isn\u2019t entirely invulnerable. There\u2019s no way of knowing at which point in history Wakanda leapfrogged the rest of the world in terms of technology, or when it could have safely revealed itself and potentially gone to war with other nations. The ancient vibranium pickaxe Klaue and Killmonger steal from the fictional British museum is invaluable, but it\u2019s a snapshot of where Wakanda was at the time. The weapon was undoubtedly formidable, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Wakanda was in a position to wage open war with the world with any hope of emerging as the victor. In shrouding itself in secrecy, Wakanda was able to become the formidable force we know it to be, and Okoye keenly understands that. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that stance is the morally right one\u2014and we see Okoye coming to grips with the difficulty of that truth when she\u2019s torn by her compulsion to remain loyal to the throne after Killmonger takes it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scene toward the end of the film when Okoye and Nakia voice their ideological differences is self-contained, but it\u2019s also an encapsulation of the debates that T\u2019Challa has been subtextually party to throughout the entire film. Their discourse is the foundation upon which T\u2019Challa\u2014and by extension, the rest of Wakanda\u2014builds his new ideology. What\u2019s most profound about the split between the two women is that the film goes out of its way to make sure the audience understands that neither of them is really in the wrong and that their parting of ways ends up being the right decision. Were it not for Nakia, Ramonda, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman), T\u2019Challa would without a doubt have been murdered. But Okoye staying close to the throne with the other Dora Milaje ends up putting her in the perfect position to rally her troops to rise up against Killmonger in Black Panther\u2019s climactic battle.\n\nBlack Panther wants us to listen to its women both because it\u2019s the right thing to do and because that\u2019s part of the egalitarian political society that it depicts Wakanda as being. A number of the other tribes that make up Wakanda\u2019s ruling elites are shown as being led by women, and Nakia herself is the appointed champion of the River Tribe who, should they choose to do so, would challenge T\u2019Challa in ritual combat for the throne. T\u2019Challa has faith in Nakia because of his personal relationship with her (and because she\u2019s right), but no matter what, Wakanda\u2019s culture still would have elevated her as a rightful potential claimant to the throne because she\u2019s the woman for the job.\n\nEven outside of Wakanda\u2019s politics or Black Panther\u2019s message about Wakanda\u2019s responsibilities, the women in the film are the force that propels the story forward. Shuri is the not only the scene-stealer of the film, but she\u2019s also the driving force behind Wakanda\u2019s most recent technological innovations. These end up not only saving her brother\u2019s life, directly and indirectly, on multiple occasions, but also all of Wakanda; without her, T\u2019Challa (and Ross) would be dead, Killmonger would rule Wakanda, and the entire world would be engulfed in vibranium-powered conflict. Meanwhile, the warriors of Okoye\u2019s Dora Milaje are the primary force that keeps Wakanda from collapsing entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s the voices of Black Panther\u2019s women that ultimately make the movie so dynamic and help the movie lay a larger groundwork for future additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I don\u2019t have any issue with him being a black Republican. I think many black Democrats, independents and definitely Hoteps fall into this trap of placing black Republicans at the heel of the white man, but I am not one of them. I believe that you can be a black Republican who just views things differently.\n\nBut beneath all of that is Pastor Mark Burns, a man so scorned that he is living in a bizarro Wakanda in which black people are living on sharecropped land that they believe they own but is really in the master\u2019s yard.\n\nOn the surface, Burns is an easily dismissible figure; he\u2019s a black pastor stumping for Donald Trump. If that isn\u2019t enough, he wears really short, fat Laurel-and-Hardy-esque ties (see below), and if you can make it past his tie, which looks like a cutoff sweatpants leg, then don\u2019t forget that he also lied about his entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and when he was called out on it during a live interview, he walked out. For all his heavy breathing and pastoral pauses, Burns could easily be labeled a huckster and placed into a box along with the rest of the sunken-place Trump supporters.\n\nBut we live in a social media world that trades likes and follows as digital currency, and in this sense, Burns is balling. To date, Burns has some 87,300 followers on Twitter and an additional 4,500 on Instagram. Not to mention, he pastors a church, which means he\u2019s preaching his love of Trump and all things Trumpian to rooms full of black people. And. They. Are. Listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to two points: 1) We cannot dismiss Burns, and 2) What the fuck happened to him? Like, what level of self-hatred must you endure to fall this far? He\u2019s 38 years old, which means that someone in his life had to love him enough to induce him to the revolutionary sounds of N.W.A. Where was he during the No Limit movement? Has he ever been \u201cBout It, Bout It\u201d?\n\nDid he not watch the Diff\u2019rent Strokes episode where Dudley was almost molested by the bicycle-store owner, but for a quick-thinking Arnold? That kind of television changes a kid. I can\u2019t imagine the kind of woodsy upbringing that allows a black man in 2018, the year of our lord and savior Sterling K.

I don\u2019t understand how a Southern black man becomes this way, but it has me thinking that it was beaten out of him. And if so, that means that the whipping of blacks is still alive\u2014but I just can\u2019t imagine a world where you not only voluntarily allow yourself to be whipped but also actually sell it to your own people.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if Burns didn\u2019t have an audience, but someone is paying attention to his message, and it isn\u2019t just Southern whites and Russian bots.

In those memos, Comey wrote about each time the president attempted to manipulate, dominate, bully and outright obstruct the federal investigation into Russian involvement in the election.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after a memo written by Comey revealed that the president had attempted to get him to put an end to the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was appointed to both investigate the Russian collusion and look into whether or not the president had obstructed justice.\n\nObstruction of justice appears to be the larger part of Mueller\u2019s focus at this time, but he is still gathering information on possible Russian interference. Sessions, who was head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team, can answer questions on the campaign\u2019s ties to the Russians as well as on whether or not Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.\n\nRemember, Trump was very upset when Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation last year and even said in an interview that he never would have given Sessions the job of attorney general if he had known that was going to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, Sessions has tea to spill.\n\nThis is all leading up to the eventual interview between Trump and Mueller, during which the president will likely be questioned about his decisions to send both Flynn and Comey packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s team are already preparing themselves for the inevitable.

Instead, there exists a dual tendency to whitewash and masculinize the people pulling long hours to support themselves and their families, with lawmakers still fixated on coal mines and the factory floor while largely ignoring the cash register and American household as scenes of actual labor.\n\nAs an antidote to the multiple erasures that obscure what most women\u2019s labor actually looks like, Splinter is running a series of interviews with women who work in industries \u2014healthcare, service, education\u2014that are common among and dominated by women. A failure to understand women\u2019s actual work is a failure to understand the policies they need in place to better support themselves and their families.

It\u2019s a lot of physical labor and a lot of emotions. There\u2019s a lot of lifting, a lot of physical work to take care of the patients, whether in-home or in a facility. In-home care work is more on a personal level: You cook for the patient, you make sure their house is clean, you make sure that the family is also able to take care of the client after you leave their home. It\u2019s the same in the facility\u2014you may not have to cook, but you feed them, you dress them, you make sure there are no skin problems if they\u2019re bed-bound and you\u2019re changing them.

I was unemployed for over a year and I had a best friend who knew I was looking for work. She told me about this field.\n\nWhat are your wages like? I make less than $20,000 a year.\n\nHow many people do you support on your income? I have a family of four. My children are ages 15 to 23. I also have a granddaughter, and I help my son with her. You just pray to get by. You make other decisions, you donate plasma. I do braids on the side, I make wigs. Whatever ways you can make an extra dollar, then that\u2019s what you do. Right now I receive supplemental assistance for food, but it\u2019s not enough. I have boys, and those boys eat. They have friends who come over who also have to eat. These food stamps are not just for my family\u2014I am a member of my community, I want my house to be a safe ground. You may not have any food today, and I may not have any food tomorrow.

There\u2019s a lot of variables of just getting to work\u2014if it\u2019s pouring down rain, it\u2019s too hot. It varies day to day, but I always try to go to work with a positive attitude. Some days, you don\u2019t want to be positive, but in the field I work in, you need a smile on your face. They need to know you\u2019re there to take care of them, not just for a paycheck. I work from 3pm to 11pm, sometimes 11:30. When I get home depends on what the patient needs\u2014if they need a little extra care at the end of the night, or if they\u2019re hurt, then I stay a little later. It all depends on what happens on the job. The latest I get home is about 12:20 a.m., after midnight. I also organize with We Dream In Black, which is part of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. It makes a difference to go to the politicians, speak to city council members, and talk about working class women\u2014about black working women. We are out here, we\u2019re protesting, we\u2019re getting signatures, we\u2019re going to the council board meetings. We are speaking out for our women. All of that makes a difference. I\u2019m not able to make every meeting, but I\u2019m there in my heart.\n\nAre you able to save money on your income? No, I don\u2019t have any savings.\n\nDoes it worry you? It\u2019s a deep concern. Just this morning I had to ask someone for a ride so my son could go to the doctor. I didn\u2019t have any money for a cab. If I was able to have a savings account, I could have something to fall back on. Every penny I get goes into my household or supporting my community. It\u2019s not just my family that I support on this income. Having a savings is having a backbone\u2014rainy day money, as my father would say. I want to make sure I can pay the doctor bill if my son has an emergency and not be scared about the bill that\u2019s coming later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have health insurance? Right now my insurance is through Medicaid, it\u2019s a family plan. We pay a certain percentage out of pocket and if Medicaid doesn\u2019t cover whatever is going on at a particular doctor\u2019s visit, they will bill you.\n\nWhat do you think it means to be a woman who works? I believe most women are struggling. We are not respected as working people, most of us. They want to pay us the very least they can pay us, no matter what the job, from secretary to construction worker, because women work it all. There are so many variables out there being faced by working class women. We have to be able to properly take care of ourselves and properly take care of our loved ones.\n\n\n\nWhat does success mean to you? For me to be successful, I want to be debt free. I want to own my property, own my own land. My taxes are paid, my children are taken care of. I want to open the doors to other young people, help them come up. I want to give back to my community. I feel like if I\u2019m successful, then I can build someone else up. To me, being successful means being able to build.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWant to talk about your work life for the series?

According to a scathing bit of news from Vanity Fair, not only is Kelly\u2019s time coming to an end, but Ivanka is already looking for his replacement.\n\nHere\u2019s how Vanity Fair breaks it down:\n\nTwo prominent Republicans in frequent contact with the White House told me that Trump has discussed choosing Kelly\u2019s successor in recent days, asking a close friend what he thought about David Urban, a veteran Washington lobbyist and political operative who helped engineer Trump\u2019s victory in Pennsylvania. Ivanka is also playing a central role in the search, quietly field-testing ideas with people. \u201cIvanka is the most worried about it. She\u2019s trying to figure who replaces Kelly,\u201d a person who\u2019s spoken with her said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the magazine, the only reason Kelly hasn\u2019t been tossed out of the White House like Uncle Phil used to do Jazzy Jeff is that Trump knows that firing another senior staff member would do nothing but bring more trouble to his wobbly tenure.\n\nSources told Vanity Fair that Kelly doesn\u2019t want to be in the White House anymore and is only holding on to stay longer than Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff.\n\nThe seam started to split between Kelly and Trump after Kelly did an interview noting that the president\u2019s position had evolved since campaigning for office. The president was reportedly furious that Kelly would leak that truth on national television, since anyone with working ears and a decent set of eyes knows that his positions have moved more than an air hockey puck. Shortly after Kelly\u2019s interview, Trump took to Twitter, as he\u2019s been known to do, tweeting: \u201cThe Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who didn\u2019t see all of this coming? In fact, many people were surprised that Kelly, a four-star Marine general, who was highly respected, would agree to work with a president who\u2019s been a hot button and arguably on the wrong side of history since running for office.\n\nKelly has been credited with streamlining who has access to the president and was instrumental in kicking hangers-on Omarosa Manigault Newman and Steve Bannon out of the White House. But Trump can\u2019t stand it when someone else is seen as the adult to his petulant-child antics, so of course this was never going to work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe more Kelly plays up that he\u2019s being the adult in the room\u2014that it\u2019s basically combat duty and he\u2019s serving the country\u2014that kind of thing drives Trump nuts,\u201d a Republican close to the White House told Vanity Fair.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has fumed to friends that Kelly acts like he\u2019s running the government while Trump tweets and watches television.\n\nAlso, Trump reportedly told one friend: \u201cI\u2019ve got another nut job here who thinks he\u2019s running things,\u201d referring to Kelly, Vanity Fair reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the White House will tell you that this is more fake news and that there\u2019s nothing wrong between Kelly and Trump. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what the White House did.\n\nA White House official told Vanity Fair: \u201cIt\u2019s categorically false that Trump is unhappy with Kelly. He\u2019s only ever referred to him as the general, tough, can be rough, and commands respect.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t believe anything that comes out of the White House. If they were a pair of pants, they\u2019d be on fire. If they were a journalist, they\u2019d be BuzzFeed Benny. If they were a black woman, they\u2019d be Rachel Dolezal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, basically, it\u2019s just a matter of time until Kelly announces that he\u2019s leaving the White House for a job in the mainstream, where he can better serve the Trump administration\u2014which is starting to be the company line.\n\nRead more at Vanity Fair.", "keywords": ["vanity", "staff", "welcome", "chief", "theyd", "fair", "running", "hes", "trumps", "trump", "john", "white", "kelly", "report", "told", "house", "worn"], "polarity": 0.10879365079365076, "subjectivity": 0.48612698412698396},

Nineteen women have come out to claim that before the president became the president, he was sexually inappropriate. The claims of these 19 women run the gamut from unwanted touching to unwanted kissing, and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, a champion of women\u2019s rights and reportedly her father\u2019s moral compass on these issues, believes her father when he says that all of these women\u2014all 19 of them\u2014are lying.\n\n\u201cI believe my father,\u201d Ivanka Trump said Sunday in an exclusive interview with NBC News, claiming that the question posed to her was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know my father. So I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019m unclear how Ivanka Trump believes that the question was inappropriate. She\u2019s in the White House because her father wanted her there. She prides herself on being a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d who helps her father make difficult moral decisions.

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester.

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

But I find myself getting teary-eyed at the randomest things now: book passages (I actually got teary-eyed twice yesterday when reading Brittney Cooper\u2019s Eloquent Rage). Commercials about dog food. Kendrick Lamar songs. A memory about a parking meter. And I don\u2019t need to voluntarily engage with shit that\u2019s intended to induce tears. Because I might just spontaneously combust into a tub of saline solution.\n\nSterling K. Brown, however, is relentless. He knew of my edict not to watch shit that I know will make me cry; he knew I avoided This Is Us for that specific reason; and he knew that I planned to see Black Panther. But like the trickster and scoundrel that he is, he pulled a \u201cGotcha, bitch!\u201d on me during the movie. And then there I was, sitting in a packed theater and bawling like a baby when Daddy Killmonger came back from the grave to counsel his son. It wasn\u2019t a full ugly cry. I wasn\u2019t this guy. But it definitely was a \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t even play this off as something in my eye\u201d cry.\n\nI hate Sterling K. Brown.\n\nAs devious as he is, though, I know that even if I hadn\u2019t seen the movie, he\u2019d still somehow try to find a way to make me cry. Perhaps he\u2019d track me down in an elevator and show me some pictures of orphan puppies getting adopted. Or maybe he\u2019d send me a text saying, \u201cHey, Damon. I just went to a medium and was able to communicate with your mom. She said she\u2019s very proud of you. And that you\u2019ll always be her \u2018Dae.\u2019\u201d Or maybe he\u2019d invite me to a school where a bunch of kids just learned that they were accepted to college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, I\u2019m on to his tricks now. Which is why from this point on, I\u2019m going to carry a clip of Fergie singing the national anthem with me everywhere I go.

Obama\u2019s soaring speech, followed by Springsteen\u2019s song, offered a momentary respite from the grief, dread and shock many Americans experienced after the election of Donald Trump.\n\nAs the night came to a close and Michelle and Barack Obama walked off the stage hand in hand, one era was ending and another was coming into sharper view. Obama\u2019s and Springsteen\u2019s messages blended together to reassure listeners that everything would be all right: \u201cLeave behind your sorrows/Let this day be the last/Tomorrow there\u2019ll be sunshine/And all this darkness past.\u201d\n\nOne year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a majority of Americans know that everything is not all right. The darkness that Springsteen sang about has not passed. Instead, it has surrounded and battered us on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. Just when we think things can\u2019t get any worse, news breaks of another ill-informed, inappropriate and unpresidential tweet.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s lead role in escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea created mass hysteria in Hawaii when an emergency message was sent in error about a ballistic missile threat. Hawaiians and tourists ran to seek shelter and wrote frantic goodbyes via text message to their loved ones. Pick your nightmare. Anything is possible\u2014even nuclear holocaust\u2014with Trump as president.\n\nWe have serious cause to question whether our democratic principles will endure. Let\u2019s face the facts: The president of the United States is a racist, a xenophobe, a sexual predator, a chauvinist, and a thin-skinned and small-minded man who lacks empathy, morality and competence. He knows too little history to recognize that he is on the wrong side of it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not only naive but it is dangerous to excuse Trump\u2019s words and actions with a wave of the hand and an assertion, as House Speaker Paul Ryan made after \u201ccandid conversations\u201d with Trump, that \u201chis heart is in the right place.\u201d\n\nIt is equally wrongheaded to claim that we could not have known that Trump would disparage women and people of color as viciously as he has. Recall Trump\u2019s comments before the election about grabbing women\u2019s genitalia or his view that Mexico was sending \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d to America. Indeed, Trump catapulted himself into the political arena by ruthlessly questioning the citizenship status and the birth certificate of the country\u2019s first black president.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s racist deeds did not begin with his run for president or his decision to absolve neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., for their hateful acts this summer. For the last 40 years, Trump has actively engaged in stoking this country\u2019s racist fires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Department sued Trump in 1973 for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in some of his housing developments to African Americans. In 1989 Trump spent $85,000 on full-page advertisements in New York City newspapers that called for the death penalty for the African-American and Latino teenagers who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in the city\u2019s Central Park.\n\nAmericans knew who they were voting for, and still, they elected Trump.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the past two years, Trump has dishonored the day that celebrates the life of Martin Luther King Jr. While former presidents\u2014Republicans and Democrats alike\u2014have honored the wishes of the King family and participated in a day of service, this year, Trump played golf.\n\nLast year, during the weekend of the King holiday, Trump mischaracterized the district of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) as \u201cfalling apart (not to mention crime-infested)\u201d and \u201cin horrible shape.\u201d This was yet another example of Trump\u2019s ignorance: The district, which includes parts of Atlanta and its suburbs, is, in fact, a prosperous hub of tech companies and colleges.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination approaches this April, we must steel ourselves for more unpresidential behavior, as we have no reason to expect anything else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about \u201cshithole countries\u201d should come as no surprise to those who are familiar with his long history of racism and who have followed his rise to power. But what makes these comments so disturbing is not whether they prove that Trump is a racist. We already knew that. His comments erode American values.\n\n\n\nA poll released Thursday showed a free fall in other nations\u2019 approval of American leadership, with such approval down 18 points to a historical low of 30 percent. The United States lags behind Germany and China and ranks just slightly ahead of Russia. Recall that on the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly boasted that he would restore the respect that Obama had supposedly lost while in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruce Springsteen\u2019s song underscores American ideals and uses the image of a train as a powerful metaphor for America as a nation of immigrants. Springsteen calls for a motley group of passengers to board a train and meet him in the \u201cland of hope and dreams.\u201d This train, we are told, carries \u201csaints and sinners,\u201d \u201closers and winners,\u201d \u201cwhores and gamblers,\u201d \u201clost souls,\u201d the \u201cbrokenhearted,\u201d \u201cthieves and sweet souls departed,\u201d and \u201cfools and kings.\u201d These passengers do not need tickets, Springsteen explains; all they have to do is \u201cjust get on board.\u201d\n\nOne could argue that throughout his presidency, Obama told people in the United States and around the world that in America, a singular opportunity existed to take a seat on the train that Springsteen describes. Obama reminded us that \u201cin no other country on earth is [his] story even possible.\u201d The son of a Kenyan immigrant, a black man named Barack Hussein Obama had ascended to the highest office in the United States.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible. America will be a fundamentally different country. We have already seen parents separated from their children and deported after living in the United States for 30 years. The lives of 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d continue to hang in the balance after Trump ended the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we give up on the hard work of maintaining a vibrant and diverse democracy and if we stop striving to become a \u201cmore perfect union,\u201d we will become more isolated and more diminished in the eyes of the world than we are now. We have always fallen short of our ideals, but the current occupant of the White House appears woefully ignorant of what those ideals are.\n\n\n\nTrump sorely needs a history lesson to learn about the untold contributions of immigrants who built this country and risked their lives to defend it. Trump has no curiosity or knowledge about the realities of the lives of Haitian immigrants, who he believes \u201call have AIDS.\u201d Nor does he understand Haiti\u2019s historic achievement of becoming the world\u2019s first black republic in 1804.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe fails to grasp the consequences of military interventions, imperialism and economic exploitation that Haiti has faced. He believes that Nigerians live in \u201chuts\u201d and remains unaware that according to the U.S. census, Nigerian immigrants eclipse both whites and Asians and have the highest levels of education in the country.\n\nIt will be a herculean, if not impossible, task to disabuse Trump of the numerous stereotypes, unsophisticated thoughts and outright incorrect ideas that he holds.\n\nOne wonders if Trump knows that Founding Father and fellow New Yorker Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant born to unmarried parents on the West Indian island of Nevis. Hamilton, who created a national bank and would become the first secretary of the treasury, moved with his mother to St. Croix, which was devastated by a hurricane in 1772. He eventually made it to New York after impressing local businessmen who raised money for his passage upon reading his eloquent report about the hurricane in a local newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe preservation of American values and principles requires the courage and constant vigilance of political officials\u2014Republican and Democrat\u2014and everyday citizens. The \u201cland of hope and dreams\u201d that Bruce Springsteen sang of is not guaranteed to last forever.", "keywords": ["obama", "states", "trumps", "soul", "trump", "america", "springsteen", "train", "springsteens", "immigrants", "united", "losing"], "polarity": 0.011970418470418466, "subjectivity": 0.4373466810966811},

Turns out that a lawyer for the president of most of the Midwestern states and the part of Alabama that voted for Roy Moore paid a former adult-film star $130,000 for her silence around an alleged sexual encounter she had with Donald Trump in 2006.\n\n\n\nAccording to an explosive report in the Wall Street Journal, Michael Cohen, a lawyer for the president who spent 10 years with the Trump organization, paid the woman, Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, in October 2016, just one month before Trump was elected to office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, a quick aside to the 53 percent of white women who voted against their self-interest but are now reading this story with a look of mock horror:\n\nStop. And then stop again, and then stop some more.\n\nThis news isn\u2019t shocking to you; nor would it have changed your vote. Trump had proved himself to be a sexist, misogynist pig-face with the hands of an infant sloth long before the election, and that didn\u2019t even remotely stop you from voting for him. He had already been accused of sexually assaulting several women, was caught on audio talking about how his wealth allows him to violate women, and constantly belittled Hillary Clinton and other women along his campaign tour.

In fact, stop reading this now and go back to wearing that weird hat thing of Donald\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m back.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal report, Clifford and Trump met in July of 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. The sexual encounter happened sometime after this initial meeting. In 2016, Clifford\u2019s lawyer negotiated a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for the one-time payout, the Journal reports.\n\nA White House official said that this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has faced allegations of inappropriate behavior with women, and adamantly denied that the encounter took place.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,\u201d the White House official told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\nIn a statement sent to the Journal, Trump lawyer \u201cCohen didn\u2019t address the $130,000 payment but said of the alleged sexual encounter that \u2018President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen added in the statement: \u201cThis is now the second time that you are raising outlandish allegations against my client. You have attempted to perpetuate this false narrative for over a year; a narrative that has been consistently denied by all parties since at least 2011.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Journal has set out to prove that Clifford, 38, had in intimate relationship with the now president. The newspaper also noted that the adult-film star had been in talks with Good Morning America and that the National Enquirer had agreed to pay Clifford for a story about her relationship with Trump. However, the tabloid newspaper didn\u2019t publish the story and says that the company paid Clifford to write fitness columns and appear on magazine covers, the Journal reports.\n\nClifford didn\u2019t respond to multiple emails from the Journal seeking comment, but Cohen emailed the Journal back a response using an all-caps subject line\u2014TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN\u2014and signed by \u201cStormy Daniels,\u201d denying that she had a \u201csexual and/or romantic affair\u201d with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople with knowledge of the agreement told the Journal that Clifford actually considered ending the deal because her payment was taking too long.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Journal describes the transaction:\n\nThe payment was made to Ms. Clifford through her lawyer in the matter, Keith Davidson, with funds sent to Mr. Davidson\u2019s client-trust account at City National Bank in Los Angeles, according to the people. \u201cI previously represented Ms. Daniels,\u201d Mr. Davidson said, referring to Ms. Clifford\u2019s stage name. \u201cAttorney-client privilege prohibits me from commenting on my clients\u2019 legal matters.\u201d A spokeswoman for City National Bank declined to comment.

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

Their energy served as a stand-in for the excitement of folks all over the world; now\u2019s your chance to find out who they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got in touch with Lee Colston over the phone last week, he told me that his spirit was full and he was feeling joyful and beautiful and black that day. It was Colston and his friends Clinton Lowe and Chris Holland who shot and appeared in that video, which was retweeted by luminaries like director Ava DuVernay on its volcanic ascent through social media feeds. The three friends all work in the performing arts, as actors, writers, and activists. When recounting the story of the night the video was made, Lowe told me that the conversation didn\u2019t even start with them.\n\nThanks to bad projection, they\u2019d endured a poor movie-going experience at a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When they left the theater, they saw a man posing in front of a Black Panther display. \u201cThe man had his family with him and was trying to tell them why this was so important to him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[The family with him] were younger so you could tell they were hearing him, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe walked up to the poster, politely waiting our turn and he looked at us. He was beaming. The whole thing had us talking shit, improvising but not to make fun of him. Then Lee turns the camera on and what\u2019s in the video is in response to how dude reacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe context was off an elder\u2019s response. There was a generational connection; he\u2019s been waiting longer than we all have.\u201d\n\n\n\nColston says the older gentleman motioned for someone who was presumably his grandchild to take a picture for him in front of a poster. \u201cHe was just like \u2018look how beautiful you look, look how beautiful she is,\u2019\u201d Colston recalled. \u201cAnd he was just so proud to be seen and to have people who look like him validate his experience. So I said to Clint and Chris, \u2018look how proud and represented he feels.\u2019 This is what white people get to feel like all the time. And that started a conversation about equity in Hollywood and representation. All three of us were aware that we were poking fun with a sort of satire. The reality is that actually white people don\u2019t feel like that all the time because it\u2019s so common for them. They don\u2019t have to fight. They\u2019re not starved for images in the media that represent their full humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Colston uploaded the video to his Facebook and Twitter pages, he had a feeling it would go viral. \u201cMy social media goes viral pretty frequently,\u201d Colston offered, \u201cbecause I do a lot of commentary about, you know, art awareness, social justice, and anything that\u2019s like, the intersection of black and brilliant.\u201d\n\nStill, he was shocked when people like Michael B. Jordan and DuVernay retweeted it. \u201cI was over the moon because Ava DuVernay is one of the most brilliant directors working in Hollywood. She\u2019s absolutely brilliant. She\u2019s literally one of my dream directors to work with. Her and Ryan [Coogler].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolland didn\u2019t expect it to blow up. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this up, maybe we\u2019ll get a couple of clicks and likes but I didn\u2019t expect that moment of joy to take off the way it did.\u201d\n\nLowe thinks the energy he and his friends put into arts and activism can be felt in the video. \u201cThat was a moment in the life. If you hang out with us, it\u2019s like that 24/7,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI co-founded a group called Artists 4 Change NYC after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Individually and collectively, we\u2019ve all been doing work around anti-injustice issues, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\u201d Lowe says the energy they put into that work is what was animating them in that moment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far what they thought of the Black Panther movie itself, the three friends all loved it. Colston says he appreciated how the female leads were \u201cso mighty and powerful and strong... It\u2019s just amazing to get gorgeous black women in such an incredible display!\u201d he said. The film\u2019s villain got to him, too.\n\n\u201cKillmonger was just so broken, y\u2019know? I recognized that his [actions] aren\u2019t the answer but his argument made so much sense because it came from a place of being forgotten and brutalized. It\u2019s basically, \u2018If Wakanda is not going to do the moral thing and stand up for people who can\u2019t protect themselves, then I\u2019m going to make sure that the people who are marginalized, at-risk, and under attack, have the resources and equipment to defend themselves since this moral superpower [of Wakanda] is failing them. Who can argue with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come,\u201d Lowe told me from Alabama, where he\u2019s acting in a touring production about the life of football legend Bear Bryant. \u201cIt was the dream of the slave. There\u2019s still a long way to go but [Black Panther] represents the beginning of the next phase of work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[In Black Panther], we\u2019re not ornaments to a white narrative,\u201d Holland said. The NYU grad student had an intensely personal connection with the movie because of where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m originally from East Oakland, California; I\u2019m from 79 and MacArthur. My dad works for BART and, growing up, my BART stop was Oakland Coliseum. As soon as that opening shot came up\u2014\u201c1992 Oakland, California\u2014I was lit. I was screaming in the movie theater. Then, that line that Michael B. Jordan says at the end about a kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales really got me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come.\u201d - Clinton Lowe\n\nOf the three, Colston had the deepest connection to comics before seeing the movie. \u201cI think my first introduction to comics was the Tim Burton Batman films when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember how much they inspired me. Then I got into X-Men and Spider-Man. My first introduction to Black Panther was an animated Fantastic Four series and I went back to go research him and fell in love with the character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColston hopes that Black Panther can spark similar epiphanies in the audiences going to see it. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these films with white people\u2019s humanity on display,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the inverse isn\u2019t really that true. There\u2019s something powerful about having a six-year-old white kid walk into the film and be completely enraptured with the glory, beauty, and humanity of the characters in this film.\u201d", "keywords": ["finally", "favorite", "friends", "colston", "movie", "wakanda", "internets", "panther", "going", "lowe", "work", "fans", "video", "look", "white", "talk", "black"], "polarity": 0.18402777777777776, "subjectivity": 0.4675264550264549},

That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["know", "marvel", "important", "wakanda", "walks", "panther", "different", "africa", "production", "beachler", "studiosdisney", "world", "black", "designer", "told", "hannah"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester.

Anderson said she shoved his hand away, and the incident lasted no more than 30 seconds.\n\nThe Post approached Anderson to tell her story after a reporter heard about the incident from a friend of Anderson's, but she was not immediately ready to go public until she saw the Times article and a People magazine first-person account.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sexual assault issue, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve kept quiet on my own,\u201d Anderson said to the Post. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always kept quiet.

This was all about \u201cLook at how regular I am and I still find time to dance with my babies\u201d\u2014and also check out an article about my new book!\n\nIt\u2019s disrespectful to real working moms: Moms who have to find sitters when the school is closed. Moms who have to decide whether they can catch the bus to work or give their child money for school lunch. Moms who can\u2019t afford sitters, so they have to drag their kids to their jobs. Moms who are standing on the front lines to increase the minimum wage so that it can actually be a livable wage. Moms who actually work, because to this day, no one\u2014including her dumb-ass father\u2014knows what the hell it is that Lil\u2019 Trumpet does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeriously, if anyone knows what makes her a \u201cworking mom,\u201d when her entire life was handed to her, please fill me in. At this point, her life, her \u201cjob,\u201d her trying to position herself as a \u201cworking mom,\u201d is the same bullshit that this administration has been trying to shovel down our throats from the beginning. This shifting narrative to make Ivanka Trump an everyday woman of the people is total bullshit. She is the daughter of a tyrant who does tyrant-daughter shit\u2014you know, stroll around the palace and eat grapes and order the deaths of people and stuff.\n\nThere has to be a limit to the levels that this administration will stoop to, but so far we haven\u2019t seen it. What\u2019s worse than pushing your kids on your IG page to sell your dumb-ass book is you acting as if you\u2019re a real working mom. It\u2019s disrespectful, and I am offended as the son of a mom who worked tirelessly to raise three kids.

Killmonger definitely isn\u2019t \u201cgood,\u201d but he isn\u2019t entirely \u201cbad,\u201d either.\n\nHe\u2019s human, and he\u2019s got a motivation and perspective that Black Panther wants you to sit with and contemplate long after the second post-credit scene sequence ends. Killmonger is a very much a narrative villain who does the sort of things that bad guys do, but at the same time he\u2019s a person you can see yourself in all too clearly when you put yourself in his shoes.\n\nKillmonger has a perfectly understandable reason for harboring a deep resentment for the Wakandan royal family and, to a point, the country itself. Early in the film, we learn through a flashback that Killmonger\u2019s father N\u2019Jobu, a Wakandan prince-turned-spy embedded in Oakland, California, chose to betray Wakanda.\n\nBy partnering with Ulysses Klaue to steal vibranium from Wakanda, N\u2019Jobu strongly believed that he would have been able to set off a revolution designed to bring an end to Wakanda\u2019s isolationist politics, something he felt was for the greater good. To N\u2019Jobu, Wakanda\u2019s culture of secrecy and its noninterference in the affairs of other countries were a kind of social negligence that contributed to the oppression of black people across the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepending on how you look at it, N\u2019Jobu has a very, very good point. While present-day Wakanda is meant to be something on the order of 20 to 25 years ahead of the rest of the world, the implication is that in the past, the country was centuries ahead of its peers and thus was in a position to change the course of history\u2014especially as it relates to the African diaspora. N\u2019Jobu impressed these ideas upon his son and told Erik about the technological might of his home country, and the origins of their family tree. T\u2019Chaka\u2019s ultimate decision to execute N\u2019Jobu for his treason is understandable, but so too is the rage that his father\u2019s death sparks in Erik\u2014a rage amplified by the fact that T\u2019Chaka abandons his young, newly-orphaned nephew behind in America.\n\nImagine knowing that you were descended from the royalty of an African country that had the power to upend the racial hierarchies that brutalized other black people across the world. Not only that, but when presented with the opportunity to go back to that country, your very own family made a point of rejecting you in an effort to protect itself. You would feel hurt and lost, and most likely filled with a deep-seated rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik\u2019s predicament is the perfect crystallization of the inevitable tragedy that comes with fantasizing about a place like Wakanda where black people are truly free and unburdened by the impacts of institutionalized racism. Wakanda\u2019s very existence means that, for Erik, there\u2019s always a place where he could and would thrive in ways that he can barely imagine, but rather than being welcomed there, he\u2019s cast out and left to fend for himself. Erik is a stand-in for all of us who want to be part of Wakanda, even though Wakanda doesn\u2019t want part of anything else but itself. That\u2019s the harsh, canon reality of the Wakanda from Marvel\u2019s comics. The country is better off than the rest of the world and it is the kind of place where black people could flourish and prosper, but the Wakandans choose to keep to themselves, albeit for a number of obvious and valid reasons.\n\n\n\nThe enthusiasm with which we (and by \u201cwe,\u201d I mean black people) celebrate Wakanda is, in a way, somewhat at odds with the painful realities that would come along with the existence of such a country\u2014like the fact that they simply don\u2019t welcome outsiders. But there are heavier questions at hand as well. Where was Wakanda during the centuries when Western countries institutionalized the enslavement of Africans from other nations, during the Civil Rights era, or when other movements focused on the agitation for black equality?\n\nFrom both N\u2019Jobu and Killmonger\u2019s perspectives, the whole history of black pain and suffering at the hands of those who see us as less than is something that Wakanda could have changed if it chose to, but it didn\u2019t. Those who suffered and suffer have a right to be angry, and if you were in the same position as they were, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019d feel the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther poses these questions to its heroes in such a way that makes clear that the film doesn\u2019t wholly see Killmonger as a villain. He\u2019s grappling with a multigenerational grief over what could have been, both for him and black people as a global community; it makes sense that he would see seizing the throne as an opportunity to begin righting the wrongs that have hurt him so deeply.\n\n\n\nAs a concept, Wakanda\u2019s a vastly different place than when it was first introduced in Marvel\u2019s comics back in 1966. As more and more black fans and comics creators have come to love and create new stories for the Black Panther, Wakanda\u2019s become so much more than a thought experiment about what an African country would be like if it\u2019d been untouched and unconquered by colonizers. The Wakanda we celebrate in our excited conversations about Black Panther is a love letter to the African continent, those of us who carry it with us in our blood, and wear it on our skin. It\u2019s the Wakanda that N\u2019Jobu likely told Erik stories about when he was a young boy\u2014a wondrous place where his talents and potential would never be squandered or extinguished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik Killmonger\u2019s story is tragic, but Black Panther expertly frames it as the ideal opportunity to confront the difficult questions we\u2019ve all asked ourselves about Wakanda. He\u2019s far from perfect\u2014indeed, he\u2019s a vicious killer. But he isn\u2019t exactly a villain, either. He\u2019s human and fragile and trying to work through a constellation of difficult, agonizing feelings. He\u2019s all of us.", "keywords": ["loves", "killmonger", "wakanda", "panther", "wakandas", "panthers", "hes", "country", "place", "njobu", "erik", "black", "didnt", "love"], "polarity": 0.07748868998869003, "subjectivity": 0.5189931164931162},

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester.

In the video, Trump bragged about being able to do whatever he wanted to women because he is famous. Those braggadocious claims seem to have been substantiated in a Wednesday New York Times article in which two women accused Trump of forcibly groping or kissing them.

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A \u2018gun free\u2019 school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on: \u201cIf a potential \u2018sicko shooter\u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing.

Although I sat right in the middle of the theater rocking a heather-gray sweatshirt with T\u2019Challa emulating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute, a couple of white film critics must not have noticed me and proceeded to have quite the interesting exchange that I ear-hustled. It went a little something like this \u2026\n\nCritic A: I\u2019m really sick of the hype.\n\nCritic B: I know, it\u2019s been a lot.\n\nCritic A: You think it\u2019s going to live up to the hype?\n\nCritic B: If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to be that guy who writes the bad review.\n\nCritic A: I know. With all of the \u201cmovements\u201d going on, even if it isn\u2019t that good, you can\u2019t write a bad thing about it.\n\nCritic B: Exactly.\n\nOnce the credits rolled, a sense of pride swelled in my chest considering that, in my humble opinion, Black Panther lived up to the hype. However, I couldn\u2019t help eavesdropping on the film critics who spoke before the film to get their thoughts.\n\nUltimately, they thought the movie was good but not great, and ranked it somewhere in the middle of the 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have been released since 20o8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left the movie theater wondering how many other film critics felt the same way about Black Panther but refused to be those critics. After all, everyone saw how Irish Independent\u2019s Ed Power was raked over the coals on social media after his negative review apparently broke Black Panther\u2019s 100 percent-positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. Is a bad review of a movie with so much hype and cultural relevance to a community worth the perceived backlash?\n\nAnd with that, does that mean that Black Panther has been graded on a curve?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact that Power gave the film a negative review. Instead, it was the rationale behind the review (T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t beat up enough bad guys) that drew the ire of fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there may be other critics like the ones I overheard at the theater who think that black folks aren\u2019t willing to accept a critical review, and will therefore grade the film on a curve for fear of being attacked on social media. That method of thinking reduces African Americans to an irrational collective that is of the same mind. And that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nNot everyone in the African-American community loved Black Panther, for a variety of reasons, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nSurely, one scan of your social media timeline will find many debates regarding whether or not the movie lived up to the hype. It\u2019s what makes Black Panther such a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that we can debate about a blockbuster superhero movie with a predominantly black cast, a black lead and a black director bears a great deal of significance. Don\u2019t get it confused: We can accept a negative review from a nonblack film critic as long as the words back up the grade.\n\nOn the flip side, there are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians in the African-American community who made their decision long ago that they wouldn\u2019t like the film. One black film critic who tore the film to shreds was the National Review\u2019s Armond White (cinema\u2019s Jason Whitlock, if you will).\n\nFor the uninitiated, White has long been considered a contrarian troll in the film-critic community. He\u2019s responsible for the first review to break Get Out\u2019s 100 percent-positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and has served up negative reviews for universally acclaimed films including The Dark Night and Toy Story 3, while praising other lowly rated films such as Jonah Hex and Grown Ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut Oedipal conflict is too serious for the Marvel Comic Universe, so careerist [Ryan] Coogler gets distracted from his real subject and creates a kind of ideological retreat in which Afrocentricity becomes an opportunistic folly,\u201d White writes of Black Panther. \u201cUnlike biracial Vin Diesel\u2019s The Chronicles of Riddick, which translated racial and political awareness into a quasi-classical drama, Black Panther marginalizes its white characters: \u2018Another broken white boy for us to fix,\u2019 a Wakanda scientist rhetorically spears a CIA outsider. Its focus is on what masculinity means for heartbroken black boys.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. He compared Black Panther to The Chronicles of Riddick in terms of how those films dealt with the subject of race.\n\nUntil there are more African-American movie critics who are part of the Rotten Tomatoes algorithm to balance out nonsense like this, there will remain a curiosity as to whether these reviewers are being 100 percent honest about a mainstream film that is by and about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome white critics may not be able to relate to the themes presented, and the movie may not resonate with them. Also, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that some white critics might have racial biases that affect how they critique a film. But that\u2019s pretty much how black folks have felt about the vast majority of films to which we cannot relate, but upon which are heaped tremendous praise by film critics.\n\nHopefully, a balance will eventually be struck between the racial makeup of films and the writers who critique them. Fortunately, Black Panther has received its fair share of praise by the people who needed that escapism in a world where Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric routinely infests our news broadcasts. And that\u2019s really all that matters.", "keywords": ["movie", "panther", "curve", "community", "white", "review", "film", "negative", "black", "grading", "critics", "films"], "polarity": 0.0007537447802934588, "subjectivity": 0.4251913892400615},

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention. She also made sure that The Opposition\u2019s audience left knowing that #MeToo is far more than a hashtag:\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement is here to stay,\u201d said Burke.", "keywords": ["keeper", "person", "keeps", "mission", "power", "harassment", "tarana", "sexual", "metoo", "klepper", "knowing", "sisters", "burke", "movement", "focused"], "polarity": 0.14142149003260113, "subjectivity": 0.49962408990186763},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["far", "school", "douglas", "right", "reform", "stoneman", "theories", "parkland", "gun", "aide", "students", "used", "state", "shooting", "survivors", "seeking", "fla"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

During an international summit Tuesday to discuss having life handed to her on a shitty Mar-a-Lago kitchen platter women\u2019s entrepreneurship along with her homegirl, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (because of course she was there during her father\u2019s meeting), Lil\u2019 Trumpet was booed and hissed, and it was glorious.

OK, they weren\u2019t that bad, but we can all dream, can\u2019t we?\n\n\u201cYou hear the reaction from the audience,\u201d Meckel said. \u201cI need to address one more point: Some attitudes toward women your father has displayed might leave one questioning whether he\u2019s such an empowerer for women.\u201d\n\nMeckel is not here for the games. What she wanted to say is, \u201cHow does your father being a man who clearly claimed he could grab women by the pussy because he\u2019s so powerful ... how does that fit into him being a champion for women?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLil\u2019 Trumpet exclaimed: \u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard the criticism from the media that\u2019s been perpetuated,\u201d to which the crowd laughed.

I grew up in a house where there was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and tenacity.

Jim Justice signed legislation giving teachers and school service personnel a 2 percent pay increase starting in July, followed by 1 percent pay scheduled to go into effect in 2020 and in 2021.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep our kids and teachers in the classroom,\u201d Justice said in a statement after signing the bill. \u201cWe certainly recognize our teachers are underpaid and this is a step in the right direction to addressing their pay issue.\u201d\n\nAccording to Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, that\u2019s a reduction of the proposed pay increase, which was a 5 percent total increase in wages, compared with the 4 percent increase in wages over the next several years that Justice ultimately signed into effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWest Virginia ranks 48th in the nation for teacher pay, Campbell said, with teachers in surrounding states making (pdf) anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 more than teachers in West Virginia. In addition, the bill did not address issues such as health care and a tax on payroll-deduction options, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cThese things got everyone here, brought everyone here, and signing a bill at 8 o\u2019clock at night wasn\u2019t going to change that,\u201d Campbell told CNN.\n\nProtests at West Virginia\u2019s Capitol began on Thursday, with thousands of teachers and supporters turning out to make their voices heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the line stretched around the building, and \u201cabout 5,170 people entered the Statehouse through the two public access points Thursday.\u201d\n\nTeachers carried that energy into day 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, West Virginia Superintendent of Schools Steven Paine issued a statement reiterating that the teacher walkout is \u201cnot lawful,\u201d while also placing full blame for school disruptions on underpaid teachers and not the state that refuses to pay them adequate wages:\n\nAs a lifelong educator, I fully recognize and support the work of our teachers and service personnel. Our educators are committed to their profession and dedicate their passions every day to providing West Virginia students with the education they deserve. Only as we are able to provide competitive benefits\u2014inclusive of adequate pay and affordable healthcare\u2014are we able to recruit and retain the best talent. I fully recognize that our teachers and service personnel deserve more and, I personally know the West Virginia Board of Education, our Governor and our State Legislators agree. Unfortunately, the economic realities of our state may not allow everything teachers deserve to take place immediately. I regret that circumstances have led to the announcement of a statewide work stoppage and I am working diligently with all parties to advocate for a prompt resolution. I am hopeful that action will be taken to prevent any disruption to students and classrooms. Work stoppages by public employees are not lawful in West Virginia and will have a negative impact on student instruction and classroom time. Families will be forced to seek out alternative safe locations for their children, and our many students who depend on schools for daily nutrition will face an additional burden. I encourage our educators to advocate for the benefits they deserve, but to seek courses of action that have the least possible disruption for our students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the strike continues, local organizations have put together backpacks of food for students who otherwise would not have access to food during the school closures.\n\n\u201cOne out of 4 children in our area are food-insecure, meaning they don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from, and the meals that they can count on are the free breakfasts and lunches in the schools,\u201d said Suzanne Brady, director of development and communication at Facing Hunger Foodbank in Huntington, W.Va.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral counties in West Virginia are also establishing supplemental child care centers so that students have somewhere to go while parents are at work.\n\n", "keywords": ["teacher", "teachers", "school", "work", "west", "closed", "remain", "increase", "pay", "strike", "public", "continues", "schools", "students", "virginia"], "polarity": 0.10648148148148147, "subjectivity": 0.3245701058201058},

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["assault", "young", "girls", "women", "wildin", "black", "sexual", "twisted", "kelly", "wendy", "metoo", "muterkelly", "williams", "comes", "r"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["republicans", "school", "cares", "took", "shootings", "president", "thats", "trump", "dont", "health", "speech", "shooting", "mental", "listened", "pretend"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

There are also teases of Ebezener Scrooge, the younger years, in him.\n\n\n\nBasically: Everything about Donald Trump Jr. is fucking annoying.\n\n\n\nSo when reports surfaced that Tropicana Jong-il II has been contemplating a run for governor of New York, the laughs flooded out as heavily as all of the stupid things that typically fall out of his mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the New York Post\u2019s Page Six, Junior recently revealed the plans to members of an \u201celite gun club.\u201d Elite, y\u2019all. According to the site\u2019s source, \u201cDon Jr. said he is interested in running for office, such as governor of New York, but the position of mayor of New York would be less interesting to him.\u201d Likewise, Junior added \u201cthat he didn\u2019t want to be one of 100 senators, nor a member of Congress.\u201d\n\nSomewhere, members of Congress are climaxing.\n\n\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the first time Junior has professed an affinity for politics and an interest in seeking office.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 2016, Junior appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union and was asked if he would consider running to be New York\u2019s mayor against Bill de Blasio. \u201cI never like to rule anything out,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe always like to keep our options open, so if I could do that as a service to my country, I would love to do that.\u201d\n\nThe question hadn\u2019t flown out of thin air. Junior\u2019s appearance came about a week after he spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Some were impressed by his remarks, but that probably had more to do with the speaking slots being filled majorly by people we\u2019d never heard of and whom most of us would never care to hear from again. Not to mention, it was Junior himself saying, \u201cPeople are saying, I should run for office.\u201d Like his father, Junior has a knack for quoting \u201cpeople\u201d when those \u201cpeople\u201d are probably only the voices in his head.\n\n\n\nSo, sure, Junior managed to form coherent sentences with energy onstage at the Z-list-heavy RNC, but it\u2019s been Tropicana Jong-il\u2019s son himself really stoking the chatter.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why he added during that same CNN appearance: \u201cWell, you know, listen, I had a good time up there. I\u2019m really frustrated with what\u2019s going on in this country. If [running for office] is how I can pay back and give something back \u2026 but, right now, I\u2019m more concerned with getting my father in there.\u201d\n\nFunny enough, in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC 4 New York/Marist Poll, 81 percent of registered voters in New York oppose an Ivanka Trump mayoral ticket, while 80 percent oppose a run by Junior.\n\nThing is, for all of 45\u2019s faults, he is a skilled performer. Being on television all of those years proved to help offset whatever else he lacked as a political novice. He is a terrible human being, but he can be engaging and, in years past, somewhat comical, in a village-idiot fashion. It doesn\u2019t excuse his other poor character traits, but it\u2019s hard to overlook how his talent as an entertainer helped give way to a stunning victory in the 2016 presidential election (coupled with racism, sexism, xenophobia and American stupidity, of course).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunior isn\u2019t his dad, and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t have the range with respect to launching the kind of political career that he believes he can. If there is any Trump kid to worry about helping to create a Trump political dynasty, it would be Ivanka Trump. Ivanka is not entertaining like her father, but she is the sort of woman the Republican Party would nominate and, arguably, the sort of woman this country would elect as its first female president. I can see her poll numbers changing, but not so much for her tacky, white-supremacist-retweeting brother.\n\n\n\nAlthough she is receiving a lot of criticism for her complicity in the monstrosities of her daddy\u2019s administration, frankly, I can just as easily see her scamming her way through a fake mea culpa on national television. By the way, for all the talk of boycotts against her products, sales of Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion label are up\u2014hugely, in fact. Remember, beloveds, black women save the Democratic Party each and every time, but the kind of white women who buy Ivanka Trump products are the same ones who so often screw us all with a Republican administration.\n\nMany of us may not be convinced by Ivanka Trump\u2019s answers to CBS\u2019 Gayle King about her lack of public condemnation of her father\u2019s bigoted policies, but the rest of the country may be falling for it or, at the very least, can likely be conned by her in the future. Donald Jr. is an obnoxious twit through and through.

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here, too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people were paying close attention to actors of South and East African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see every day\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of Africanness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sports radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by, but still, Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help shedding a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["movie", "wakanda", "panther", "characters", "going", "africa", "hail", "humanizing", "african", "film", "audiences", "black", "africans", "told", "knew"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

But only a brief year before, a judge had ruled against pop star Kesha in her own exhaustive sexual abuse trial in favor of Sony Music and her alleged abuser, producer Dr. Luke.\n\nIn this watershed moment, what would the music industry have to offer when its own moment of reckoning has so far seemed muted, at best? This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry. Their first initiative? An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage. During her introduction of what would be an emotional performance by Kesha, musician and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e gave a compelling speech, reminding the audience assembled at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden and abroad:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry.

Reuters reporters Steve Holland and John Walcott note that per a senior White House official, during a brainstorming session in the Oval Office Sunday, it was Ivanka who assisted her father in alleviating concerns about his temperament and whether he could govern effectively.\n\nThe source explained:\n\nHe had a lot of voices around him giving him ideas and suggestions that he incorporated, but he really set out to achieve that optimistic tone and that was something she was supportive of. She encouraged him to do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother source said:\n\nShe had a role. She helped set the tone.\n\nAnd:\n\nHer fingerprints are visible on the tone, but especially on those parts of it like maternity leave that matter to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, as Melania Trump was somewhere avoiding everything to do with the publicity stunt that won a presidency, it was 45\u2019s one true love saying, \u201cNo, Daddy, inside voices! Evil is delivered way better when the delivery isn\u2019t so elevated in volume. Oh, and please mention new mommies!\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s totally plausible to believe that Ivanka give her father a few tips, the problem lies in the clear intent behind this story.\n\nIt boggles the mind how she successfully manages to get outlets to repeatedly write stories about her as if she is some liberal, despite no evidence to support such categorization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are so many generous reports that claim Ivanka had spoken like a Democrat on the campaign trial\u2014including at the Republican National Convention. Still, saying that women deserve maternity leave and that child care matters doesn\u2019t make you a progressive. Neither does vacationing with a rich Democrat, as she and her power-hungry misclassified husband, Jared Kushner, have done recently. The same goes for giving money to Democratic candidates. After all, her father said he gave to both Democrats and Republicans because as a businessman, it\u2019s smart to have friends on both sides.\n\nThese days, if you don\u2019t hate people having health care, don\u2019t hang out with white supremacists, and don\u2019t complain about there being a BET Awards and not a WET Awards, some might proclaim that you sound like a Democrat. Not all of us share these low expectations, though. Ivanka herself said that she doesn\u2019t claim to be a Democrat or a Republican, but that falls in line with most \u201cindependents\u201d who are merely people with both political ideologies and commitment issues.\n\nYet, without nary a sign of a receipt, Ivanka Trump gets christened liberal or moderate or not dead inside, like her daddy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust look at how Holland and Walcott describe her in the piece:\n\nIvanka Trump, 35, the president\u2019s older daughter, has emerged as an influential informal adviser for her father, particularly on issues important to women and minorities.\n\nI need an Amber Alert to help locate what the fuck these two are talking about.\n\n\n\nThere are a few things to appreciate about Ivanka Trump. She doesn\u2019t look as stupid as her brother Eric. She\u2019s not as smug and obvious with her political ambitions as Donald Jr. She\u2019s not Tiffany Trump, bless her heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s less worth making note of is her supposed advocacy on behalf of women and minorities. With respect to women, if you are not white or well-connected; if you don\u2019t believe in not challenging a reductive view of womanhood so much as learning to thrive within the structure without making too much of a fuss, or in anything else that fits into Ivanka\u2019s overall myopic views on gender and career, is she advocating on your behalf? There is a reason why she has been called out on just who she means by \u201c#womenwhowork,\u201d and why some women have boycotted her products altogether.\n\nIf you\u2019re a minority, have you seen Ivanka mention Black Lives Matter, Islamophobia, the children in schools across the country being subjected to taunts about being deported ? Ivanka has asked for \u201ctolerance\u201d in light of the increased bomb threats aimed at Jewish Community Centers. As a convert to Judaism, that makes sense because it impacts her directly. Therein lies the problem: She typically only speaks about issues that affect her directly or that have proved to be the least controversial.\n\nWe hear that she wants to speak about climate change. We know that she has a desire to discuss human trafficking. These are important matters, but they do not negate that she purposely seeks ways to build her political clout without alienating Republicans or Democrats alike. Plenty of political consultants will call that smart, but should anyone honestly package her as a fighter for women and minorities?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome have rightly rallied against the myth of Ivanka\u2019s liberalism throughout the campaign trial, but it keeps popping back as if it\u2019s the herpes bump to the lip of our news cycle. To wit, Politico ran a story about Ivanka and Kushner staying noticeably silent as the White House rolled back protections for transgender kids in schools. Why is their silence presented as surprising?\n\nWhether or not she wants to admit it, it\u2019s pretty apparent that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have political ambitions that exceed this administration. Her dad may be an ogre who may very well see his presidency go the way of his casinos and other failed businesses, but Ivanka is far shrewder than her father.\n\nShe is poised. She is regarded as elegant. She is more disciplined than her dad and siblings. That is what makes her so scary. She looks exactly like the kind of woman the Republicans would nominate for president. She looks like someone this country would vote for as president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe benefits from so many things as a well-off, well-connected white woman who subscribes to tradition. There\u2019s not much any of us can do to compete with that. What we can do, however, is continue to gnaw away at this false image of Ivanka.\n\nLike her father, Ivanka is an opportunist. Like her father, she is willing to exploit racism for gain. Make no mistake: Being a bystander in unabashed bigotry without speaking against it makes you just as culpable. In her case, even more so, given that she\u2019s using her position as first daughter to find her own political footing. And like her father, she benefits from being associated with liberalism without touting, let alone living, any of its virtues.\n\nFor the longest time, 45 professed to be a Democrat and was deemed a New York liberal. How did that turn out? For a child who\u2019s long patterned herself after her father, don\u2019t you think she knows how history can repeat itself?", "keywords": ["filtered", "shes", "think", "version", "dad", "women", "father", "political", "democrat", "trump", "dont", "white", "tone", "ivanka", "folks"], "polarity": 0.11233766233766233, "subjectivity": 0.4633384767048133},

In fact, he\u2019s not even remotely tough. Trump is the dude who comes to the basketball court in a full official NBA shorts set to talk about how, when he was younger, he used to dunk on guys, but he never plays.

This is a time for grieving, and I wish someone would yank the president\u2019s comb-over and hip him to how to behave. Now isn\u2019t the time for this male-bravado bullshit while Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students are still struggling to make it to class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeventeen students and teachers were mercilessly gunned down, and the president has not only defended the National Rifle Association, guns, gun owners and NRA spokespeople but has also called for some teachers to be trained in taking down a school shooter. And now he\u2019s playing cowboy behind his Secret Service.\n\nCut the shit, draft dodger.\n\nAnd Trump didn\u2019t stop there. He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter!

In that brief moment of nonverbal communication, so much was conveyed. I, at least, understood that he wanted to touch my leg and, likely, my pussy\u2014and ole boy understood that he could.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where dudes get it twisted.\n\nMany men presume that it is OK to project onto women their sexual impulses and violence in physical ways. And patriarchy is mostly to blame.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode of patriarchal fuckery, actor-comedian Aziz Ansari was accused of hypersexual insensitivity. A now exhaustively debated expos\u00e9 published by online magazine Babe tells the story of an anonymous woman, given the pseudonym Grace, who claims to have found herself in a compromising position with the entertainer.\n\nAllegedly, after a speedy dinner date, the 22-year-old woman accompanied Ansari to his apartment and engaged in mutual oral sex with him, after being \u201cclawed,\u201d fingered and pounced upon\u2014and even after \u201cgetting up and moving and him following and sticking his fingers down [her] throat again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy her own admission, Grace acquiesced to sexual activity with Ansari, although she also acknowledges that she did not want to. The nature of what occurred between the two might not constitute sexual assault, but it puts the focus on fundamental glitches in modern dating and the normality of sexual misconduct.\n\nAnsari quickly issued a statement emphatically stating that \u201cby all indications [the encounter] was completely consensual,\u201d likely because everything appeared OK to him. He does not readily recognize his overtures as inappropriate. His claim absolves him of any intent to cause harm\u2014yet, by default, Grace is left to blame for her own distress.\n\nA male acquaintance of mine who has asked to remain anonymous stated, \u201cI would think that while the man is bearing all of the responsibility, she as a woman of agency and nonambiguity should advocate for herself and do what she has to in order to not let more bad happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an on-air attack, Wendy Williams blasted Grace: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just bite it and leave? \u2026 Why didn\u2019t you just grab your coat and leave, dummy?\u201d Williams asked scornfully.\n\nPerhaps they are all missing the point. Perhaps she liked him enough to renege on her usual self-standards. Perhaps she thought they\u2019d make a good couple with beautiful babies. Perhaps she was a groupie. Who knows? What we do know is that Grace was physically violated well before she took a position, well before she was browbeaten into giving a blow job and well before she gave in. Much like what happened in my situation, the point of consent was bypassed. None was given, but even worse, none was sought. It was a non-muthafuckin-factor.\n\nPeople must ask themselves why consent and communication are such an inconvenience.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must also ask why we continue to court a tradition in which boys will be boys and men will be men, no matter their indiscretions, while women are held to a five-star standard of awareness, action and responsibility. We are centuries invested in men\u2019s entitlement and audacity, and their retarded understanding of and disrespect for women\u2019s bodily rights. We live in a society where patriarchy is well-established and chronically practiced.\n\nAuthor Kiese Laymon, a professor of English and African-American studies at the University of Mississippi, asserted this idea in an interview:\n\nThe nation encourages boys and men to \u201cget\u201d sex from women by any means necessary. We are trained to believe \u201cno\u201d means \u201cnot yet.\u201d And most of all, we are also trained not to care [for] or respect the millions of women who have taught us that consent is integral to healthy sex. We allow ourselves to be trained by patriarchy and not radical black feminism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile many people are adamant about the conjecture that Grace should have acted differently, several publications\u2014particularly The Guardian and The New York Times\u2014ran pieces that also accused Grace of undermining the #MeToo movement and lamenting a failed come up. Scores of social media users have questioned her choice to perform and receive head\u2014and then still call foul.\n\nFar too many conflate Grace\u2019s actions with permission, but that is a function of patriarchy. Giving in is not synonymous with giving consent\u2014although sometimes it is entirely necessary. Being a black woman, in particular, has its cost. According to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, black women are affected by violence\u2014physical and sexual\u2014at a much higher rate than women of other races. Navigating common spaces as a black woman informs me that speaking up and taking agency is not always in my best interest. Revisiting my own situation proved this.\n\nMy date that long-ago night was amused by my subtle rejection. He thought I was being coy. He drove to the nearest Holiday Inn, parked, checked in, then returned for me, hotel key in hand. I finally found the words: \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his surprise, I rebuffed his expectation. To my surprise, his demeanor changed; his jawbone stiffened and he shut down. He drove off. We rode along a vacant Queens Boulevard in a thick silence. \u201cYou good?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bitches like you that always shit on a good nigga that treats her right, but give ain\u2019t-shit niggas the pussy.\u201d\n\nI asked to be let out of the car. He refused. At a red light, I opened the car door and let myself out\u2014he got out, too. He followed me, apologized and insisted that I stop being dramatic and get back in the car. I refused. He hauled back and slapped the shit out of me. His handprint was pressed into the side of my face\u2014literally. He rescued my body from the ground and whispered, \u201cGet the fuck in the car and don\u2019t say a word, before this shit gets worse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got back into the car. He drove back to the hotel. He fucked me. I did not utter a word, and neither did he. What wasn\u2019t said was thoroughly communicated.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, women can remain silent or vocal, stay put or take flight, hold out or put out, and still get screwed. Many times, our decision to do so boils down to matters of life or death, or both. Despite what Wendy Williams proclaims, it is far from easy to bite a man\u2019s penis and flee from the scene without bodily harm. Yet with all things considered, women are still culpable for placing themselves in bad situations\u2014men, not so much. That is patriarchy at work.\n\nThis worldview, this flawed attitude, is due for serious change. Pushing the narrative of consent and communication is not about an indictment of \u201call men\u201d but, rather, about the predatory practice of too many. Consent isn\u2019t about suppressing sexual energy; it\u2019s about respecting a woman\u2019s right to sexually engage on her terms. Communication cannot rest solely on a set of cues. And the work cannot be left solely to women and the #MeToo movement. The responsibility rests upon all of our shoulders, especially those of men.

Trump is the dude who comes to the basketball court in a full official NBA shorts set to talk about how, when he was younger, he used to dunk on guys, but he never plays. He\u2019s the guy at the barbershop who claims that he\u2019s slept with every woman but who everyone knows is really lonely. He\u2019s the guy who goes golfing and cheats.\n\nSeriously, it\u2019s one thing to add a little Lawry\u2019s to your stories when you\u2019re sitting in the barbershop or on the basketball court; it\u2019s another to tip a trough of seasoning onto a national tragedy when you\u2019re the president. This is a time for grieving, and I wish someone would yank the president\u2019s comb-over and hip him to how to behave. Now isn\u2019t the time for this male-bravado bullshit while Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students are still struggling to make it to class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeventeen students and teachers were mercilessly gunned down, and the president has not only defended the National Rifle Association, guns, gun owners and NRA spokespeople but has also called for some teachers to be trained in taking down a school shooter. And now he\u2019s playing cowboy behind his Secret Service.\n\nCut the shit, draft dodger.\n\nAnd Trump didn\u2019t stop there. He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter! The officer could\u2019ve saved lives and he froze up. It happens, and I know that this man is going to beat himself up way more than the president tried to on Monday. He\u2019s already resigned from the force. But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more cowardly\u2014not running into the school when you hear shooting, or beating someone up after the fact when you haven\u2019t done one remotely heroic thing in your life.\n\nIf anything, the officer\u2019s inaction should be proof that the president\u2019s harebrained Acme scheme of arming teachers is really fucking stupid. If an armed officer couldn\u2019t confront the shooter, then what makes the president think that a teacher would? But this is what happens when you\u2019ve lived a lily-white, privileged life on your father\u2019s fortune and never had to really fight for anything: You craft idiotic policies and criticize those in action because, well, that\u2019s what punks do.", "keywords": ["teachers", "school", "officer", "bout", "president", "hes", "wouldve", "trump", "punkass", "gun", "thing", "really", "shooter", "didnt", "florida", "run", "talking"], "polarity": -0.07832539682539683, "subjectivity": 0.5137619047619049},

Some of the stories shared through the #MeToo movement have triggered a range of emotions and questions; some may have come off as \u201cgray areas.\u201d How do we actually know when we\u2019re giving or given consent?\n\nSo glad you asked. Sexual consent is when both parties agree to have sex\u2014throughout the encounter. Let\u2019s start with the basics\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cConsent 101\u201d\u2014and then explore some less orthodox situations:\n\n\n\nDo I Really Need to Hear a \u201cYes\u201d?\n\nWell, yeah. You do. Hearing \u201cyes\u201d from your partner is\u2014and should be\u2014sexy as fuck. Speaking personally, nothing turns me on more than a partner who respects my wishes and wants to know my needs. When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely. If the connection is truly there, ask and wait for validation when the other person is sober.\n\n\n\nIf They\u2019re Not of Legal Age, Guess What?\n\nDo I have to mention that minors also aren\u2019t legally allowed to consent to sexual relations with an adult? On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist. Reach out to local authorities if you ever feel unsafe from a sexual predator. Know that you\u2019re not alone and that there are a host of places willing to help you through your trauma.

What\u2019s currently prevalent in the pieces responding to Babe\u2019s Ansari story are hyperbole, intellectual dishonesty and red herrings.\n\nIn her response to Babe\u2019s article, \u201cAziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being a Mind Reader,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Bari Weiss shrieks, \u201cThe insidious attempts by some women to criminalize awkward, gross, and entitled sex takes women back to the days of smelling salts, and fainting couches.\u201d The Los Angeles Times, unafraid to ask the \u201ctough\u201d questions, pondered, \u201cIs Aziz Ansari a Victim or Perpetrator?\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone in the histrionics competition, The Atlantic published \u201cThe Humiliation of Aziz Ansari,\u201d in which writer Caitlin Flanagan calls Babe\u2019s piece \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d and eagerly paints \u201cGrace\u201d as a nefarious, resentful, mean girl hell-bent on making Ansari pay for rejecting her, declaring, \u201cTogether, [Grace and Babe writer Katie Way] may have destroyed Ansari\u2019s career.\u201d\n\nIronically, the same parties who stress the necessity of having stringent qualifications for proper claims of sexual assault and victimhood\u2014of which they deem Grace unworthy\u2014have less demanding standards of proof when it comes to bestowing Ansari with their own thorny crowns of victimization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir flimsy concern about \u201cinfantilizing\u201d women is nothing short of laughable as they indulge in their anti-fourth-wave-feminism hysterics and pull a 34-year-old man to their heaving bosoms like vigilant caretakers, rendering him incapable of anything more malignant than simply being a creepy and inattentive sexual partner.\n\nReality is much less fantastical. Babe\u2019s piece, flawed as it may be, did not send society as we know it into a tailspin of anomie. Scores of hapless men who merely attempt conversation or interaction with women who pique their sexual interest are not being apprehended by a feminist gestapo for crimes of rape; nor did it \u201cderail\u201d the #MeToo movement for parties who weren\u2019t already looking for an excuse to dismiss it.\n\nWe do not live in a society where published allegations of sexual assault alone ruin one\u2019s career. If it\u2019s any consolation for the Weisses and Flanagans of the world, they may simply look to the likes of R. Kelly and the current president of the United States for solace in how little such accusations hinder powerful men from thriving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, Ansari\u2014much like most of the celebrities and industry insiders who have recently been accused of assault and misconduct\u2014has not been destroyed by modern-day, bloodthirsty-feminist witch hunts, excommunicated from human civilization or criminalized (pending police investigations into allegations involving Harvey Weinstein and Russell Simmons notwithstanding).\n\n\n\nGrace\u2019s account\u2014one that toggles between acquiescing to certain sexual acts and withdrawing from others\u2014is a pervasive experience. While many seem to direct their ire at Grace for her decisions and at Babe for its treatment of the story, few are expressing resentment toward the societal conditions that demand we present infallible victims with accounts of sexual abuse enshrouded in an impenetrable armor of credibility to even be taken seriously in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s time to be honest: We are a society\u2014a country especially\u2014that despises victims for having the audacity to \u201callow\u201d themselves to be victimized. When Grace describes her reaction to Ansari\u2019s advances\u2014\u201cI stopped moving my lips and went cold\u201d\u2014it was hard for me to imagine that many of us couldn\u2019t relate to that kind of dissociation. When she mentions taking a while to concede to the feeling that she\u2019d been violated, I understood her reluctance to arrive there.\n\n\n\nVictimhood is work. Acknowledging it, vocalizing it, deciding if it merits pressing charges, following through with seeking punitive recourse or any recourse, healing from it, moving on and preparing for the onslaught of interrogation from parties who are more than eager to discredit it\u2014it\u2019s arduous and painful work.\n\nThe choice to \u201cfight back\u201d when you are being pressured or overpowered during sexual interaction makes it all the more real that an assault is happening and could escalate, and the consequential stigma of victimhood all the more imminent. It\u2019s no wonder so many people resent it and try to deny their own proximity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew sins are worse in America than being powerless. Many of us, especially those of us who may have already cobbled ourselves together after recovering from prior experiences with assault, would rather dissociate and delude ourselves into believing that our own experiences with sexual coercion were just \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201cawkward\u201d instances that we gave into\u2014to avoid having to add another instance of sexual assault to an already loaded plate of trauma.\n\nThe takeaway from Grace\u2019s anecdote isn\u2019t that we should consider every regrettable or uncomfortable sexual interaction as assault (though this anecdote described more than mere discomfort; remember, sexual assault encompasses more than rape). This isn\u2019t about bad sex. It\u2019s about examining how dysfunctional our sexual socialization is for us to read that instance and chalk it up to merely being a \u201cnormal\u201d and clumsy sexual experience. There should be nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about leaving a date in tears because you feel violated, and we shouldn\u2019t be so content and flippant with characterizing it as such.\n\n\n\nUltimately, this is an incident in which many truths can exist; we can acknowledge that it\u2019s probable Ansari\u2019s celebrity and his public persona played a part in Grace wanting to give Ansari a chance to redeem himself during that evening, and even desiring his kindness after he made her uncomfortable. It\u2019s just as probable that Ansari was fully aware of the leverage his celebrity granted him over a green young woman 10 years his junior who was visibly eager to go out on a date with a popular star.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely that a man who has written a book about modern dating in which he elaborates on his habit of determining if a woman is uninterested in him simply by the tone and response time of her text messages is capable of gauging that a woman who recoils from his attempts of getting her to touch his dick for 30 minutes and verbally expresses that she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to feel forced\u201d is probably not excited about having sex with him, and consent is not static.\n\nFurthermore, claims that men in general are unable to read nonverbal cues and that anything other than a clear \u201cno\u201d confuses them have been debunked in recent studies; researchers conclude (pdf) that men are, in fact, perfectly capable of reading and recognizing nonverbal cues from women who are resistant to sex. The problem isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t understand; they just don\u2019t like the answer.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s OK to feel unsure if what Grace described as the worst night of her life neatly matches with your understanding of assault. That discussion needs to be had if we are to have a rigorous examination of our sexual politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, accusations of sexual abuse are not all going to look like scandalous, easy-to-condemn, jaw-dropping accounts of egregious brutality and predation, and alleged victims are not always going to behave in ways we understand. Nor should they have to for us to engage them responsibly.\n\nDisingenuous, lazy claims about the \u201cambiguity\u201d of both consent and resistance allow sexual assault to remain ubiquitous. If nothing else, we are a society that firmly believes in questioning the credibility of alleged victims with way more fervor than we do the actions of their alleged abusers.\n\nWe have ample leg room to, instead, fix our gaze on proper ways to handle the stories and best interest of people alleging sexual assault. We can also stand to focus a harsher lens on men like Ansari who pursue rigid sexual compliance in the face of resistance and to admonish their team of toxic acolytes who are more than eager to dismiss their harmfulness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to push forward conversations about sexual abuse and all of its variations, we need to be prepared to be uncomfortable, unsure and conflicted. It\u2019s not a precursor to anarchy or a disservice to the movement if we question what we have accepted to be normal and entertain the possibility that we have been harmed or may have also caused harm during the course of our sexual experiences.\n\nRest assured, we have not strayed that far from the status quo.

Women like Mary J. Blige have revealed that they were molested at 5 years old and throughout their adolescence. I\u2019ve watched writers call allegations against performative allies like Aziz Ansari \u201crevenge porn,\u201d while Twitter debated whether or not sexual coercion is actually OK.

That\u2019s right. Charges of abuse of at least 140 girls and young women went ignored and unnoticed for years. Young black women like Biles and Gabby Douglas, who\u2019ve made history on our television screens, were allegedly violated repeatedly by a person who was paid to ensure their health. These young women who proudly represented this country were forced to return to the sites of their molestation every day to relive that trauma.\n\n\n\nEvery time I see news like this, I relive my own sexual trauma. I\u2019m reminded of each woman in my life who has been molested and abused and the likelihood that, despite this cultural \u201creckoning,\u201d women and girls will continue to be assaulted every day.

Kelly and Bill Cosby because we value their art more than we value the lives of young black girls and women.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll probably never meet a woman who hasn\u2019t said #MeToo.

But I disliked everything about schools. I hated the pretentious kids at my school, I hated the cardboard cutout curriculum, and I especially hated the canned food they reheated and sold for five to ten dollars per day.\n\nMy decision was especially was off putting to my family because of the type of people and situations they thought I would be around. I wasn\u2019t the most sheltered person, but I was a bit more privileged than the typical 18-year-old who chooses to join the army. Going from nuns and affluent stay at home moms to drill sergeants not-all-that-much-different than the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket was a bit of a culture shock. But I handled it\n\nI am now going on my 6th year in the military. When I left my first duty station in Alaska, I changed from active duty to reserves. After my active duty discharge, I started wearing headwraps. Whether it was the bright and beautiful colors of the different cloths, or the fact that my ears were never again cold, I loved them. I wear them everywhere. (Also, I have to say that the headwrap changes the way men approach me on the street. Instead of \"hey redbone\" or \"hey bitch\" its \"hey beautiful nubian sista.\" Which I know is super, duper problematic, but that's another topic for another day.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only time I can't and don't wear them is with military uniforms. Not that I would want to in my new unit, which is located in backwoods West Virginia. I\u2019m not going to say they fit every single stereotype up there but holy hell they sure do come pretty close. And something happened to me recently that exemplifies that. And the fallacy of us existing in a \"post-racial' America.\n\nI was there for a weekend for drill. Once a month, we show up in uniform for a weekend and do a month\u2019s work of work in two days. It was after hours so I was off duty and going to eat dinner at one of the local eateries. I was sitting down minding my business \u2014 literally not doing anything but staring at my phone rereading Fifty Shades of Grey because I\u2019m a lonely woman \u2014 when I hear several grossly uncomfortable comments that made my skin literally crawl and urged my legs to move me to the exit.\n\n\"Why the fuck would she come around here knowing there are soldiers that frequent this area?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Check if she has a bag\"\n\n\"I wonder if she would cry if I ripped it off her head?\"\n\n\"Her father probably raped her, that's why she's shy\"\n\nI am by no means a passive, let people roll over me, let it slide, turn the cheek type of person.

What he said was laden with swear words, slurs, words that I can only guess about, and spittle. Lots and lots of spittle. Here\u2019s my kosher and SFW translation:\n\n\"It's really disrespectful of you to wear that (points at my head wrap) around here. The troops are honorable and they don't need constant reminders of why all their friends are dying. You need to take that off.\"\n\nNow, the military has taught me several things that I value. Because of those harsh lessons, I carry a knife. More precisely, I carry a tactical knife. A benchmade 556 Griptillian. It's sharp. It's always concealed on my hip. By the time I heard their giggles and saw them swaying towards me, I had already grabbed Bessie (my knife) and had her in an ice pick grip with the edge out and the tip aggressively carving into the wood of table. It took them too long to notice, but I noticed when they had just begun to notice. The misguided young lady flexed her arm to reach towards me \u2014 not sure what the she was intending to do without getting her fingers sliced off \u2014 but I pulled the knife out of the table and flipped it around in my palm and pointed it at her. She was not as stupid as I thought because she stopped her advance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat came next is the best and most accidentally craziest \u2014 and probably sexiest (to the right person) \u2014 thing I\u2019ve ever said.

I didn't blink. They blinked again. I must have been a good liar.

At the time, he was 22; his victim, Jules Woodson, was 17.\n\nOn Thursday night, Highpoint Church\u2019s lead pastor, Chris Conlee, announced in a statement that the church had issued Savage a leave of absence to begin immediately.\n\nEarlier:\n\nToday we bring you two accounts of pastors accused of sexually assaulting minors\u2014with two very different endings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one case coming out of Fayetteville, N.C., a former pastor has been charged with 142 charges of child sex crimes, including the rapes of four children. According to WTVD-TV, Glenn Tyrone Collins has been accused of repeatedly sexually abusing children between 1996 and 2009.\n\nThe TV outlet notes that one of the alleged victims was Collins\u2019 neighbor. But a look at the charges against Collins\u2014namely, 39 counts of sexual activity by a parent\u2014indicates that Collins is also accused of abusing one or more of his own children or, at the very least, someone for whom he was the primary guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that they picked up the case after one of Collins\u2019 accusers came forward, describing the alleged abuse as years of emotional torture, according to WTVD-TV. Collins turned himself in to police on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nAt a bond hearing, Collins pleaded with a judge for his release, defended his reputation as a pillar in the community and told the court that he wasn\u2019t \u201cguilty of this stuff.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday, the former pastor was being held at the Cumberland County Jail on a $3.75 million bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs North Carolina police were securing warrants against Collins, in Memphis, Tenn., a pastor of a megachurch there received a standing ovation from his congregation Sunday after admitting to his abuse of a child.\n\nAndy Savage admitted to his flock that he had engaged in a \u201csexual incident\u201d with a teenage girl he drove home from church 20 years ago. He was a youth minister at a church in suburban Houston at the time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\n[Savage] did not tell the congregation at Highpoint Church what took place in 1998, but he said that he had sinned, taken responsibility for it and never kept it a secret from church leaders. He said that before [his accuser] took her story public, he believed that the episode had been \u201cdealt with in Texas.\u201d \u201cUntil now, I did not know there was unfinished business with Jules,\u201d Mr. Savage, 42, said during the service, which was streamed live online. \u201cJules, I am deeply sorry for my actions 20 years ago. I remain committed to cooperate with you toward forgiveness and healing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Savage didn\u2019t come forward with his \u201csin\u201d of his own volition. His accuser, Jules Woodson, went public just days before, writing a blog post that detailed his assault against her.\n\nIn the blog, which highlights sexual abuse within the church, Woodson says that Savage offered to take her home from church, where she had gone after school. Instead of dropping her off at her house, though, Savage drove past to a secluded area and had Woodson perform oral sex on him. Later, she says, Savage got out of the car and went to her passenger-side door, getting on his knees and begging her not to tell anyone what happened.\n\nAccording to Woodson, the man of Gold told her, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone, Jules, please. You have to take this to the grave with you.\u201d She was 17 years old at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoodson says that she reached out to Savage following news of Matt Lauer\u2019s firing from NBC for sexual abuse, asking him in an email if he remembered that night, and the sexual assault that took place.\n\nSavage never responded to her. After a month of no reply, reports the Times, Woodson decided that it was time to go public with her story.\n\nWoodson also told the Times that she had reported the incident to an associate pastor at the church back in \u201998. Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Woodson says that Larry Cotton, a pastor at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church, advised her to stay quiet and said that the church would address the issue itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nAfter Ms. Woodson told Mr. Cotton about her story in 1998, she said the church sent Mr. Savage to apologize to her mother. But he never told her mother explicitly what had happened, leaving the impression that they had only kissed. In Sunday\u2019s service, Mr. Savage said that at the time he handled the situation in a \u201cbiblical way\u201d and resigned from the church and returned to his hometown, Memphis.\ufeff\n\nWhere, as we know, Savage simply went on to another church.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d like to know specifically what \u201cbiblical way\u201d Savage took to address this situation. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t wandering in the desert for 40 years. And I must have missed the part in the Bible where a man of God takes advantage of a teenage girl, gets called out on his behavior and then just bounces to another, bigger church where he receives a 20-second standing ovation for admitting he abused his power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe that\u2019s in Deuteronomy, or maybe Jesus only wanted teenage girls in dark, secluded places to touch the hem of his garment.\n\nEither way, Highpoint Church says it\u2019s standing by its man.\n\nRead more at WTDV-TV and the New York Times.", "keywords": ["savage", "sexually", "church", "took", "assaulting", "woodson", "pastor", "leave", "jules", "sexual", "mr", "admitted", "told", "collins", "teen"], "polarity": 0.09166528925619834, "subjectivity": 0.44981031090121987},

I want to do that shit. Like, I got desire ... not for nobody else ... it just ... I want something where I can say, \u2018I fucking did that\u2019 ... me personally.\u201d\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nAccording to the complaint, Horry County, S.C., police knew McDowell as someone who had made white supremacist connections while serving prison sentences for various criminal offenses. He posted rambling, expletive-filled white supremacist rants on Facebook, and in early January, requested an \u201ciron\u201d\u2014or gun\u2014from someone through Facebook instant messenger, according to the complaint. Less than a week later, he was in touch with an undercover FBI employee whom McDowell believed handled problems for the Aryan Nations, a group that espouses racist and anti-Semitic beliefs. McDowell\u2019s case is somewhat similar to Roof\u2019s in that Roof, too, expressed frustration that, in his view, white supremacists were not taking enough action. Roof, who was sentenced to death last month for shooting and killing nine black parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, wrote in a journal that he \u201cwould rather live imprisoned knowing I took action for my race than to live with the torture of sitting idle\u201d and suggested he hoped others might follow suit. \u201cIt isn\u2019t up to me anymore,\u201d Roof said. \u201cI did what I could do. I\u2019ve done all I can do. I did what I thought would make the biggest wave, and now the fate of our race sits in the hands of my brothers who continue to live freely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcDowell apparently had not picked a specific target and did not have a plan of attack, but he told the undercover FBI employee that he wanted to target nonwhites at a county outside of where he lived, and he did not want to get caught.\n\n\u201cI got the heart to do this,\u201d McDowell said, according to authorities.\n\nMcDowell, according to officials, asked the undercover FBI employee to buy him a handgun, and that serves as the basis for the criminal charge against him; McDowell is a felon and therefore forbidden from possessing a firearm. The employee and McDowell hatched a plan in which the employee would pick him up from his mother\u2019s house and drive him to his grandfather\u2019s house to get money to pay for the gun and ammunition, authorities say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, McDowell and the employee met as planned, and McDowell purchased a .40-caliber handgun with a shaved-down firing pin for $109, officials say. He was then arrested by federal agents.\n\nInterestingly enough (not), in none of the reports that I\u2019ve read about McDowell has he been described as a terrorist, but had he been brown-skinned and Muslim, the efforts to tar him with that descriptor would have been immediate and endless. Let\u2019s call it what it is: These white supremacists plotting these actions are domestic terrorists, plain and simple.\n\nIt\u2019s also ironic that McDowell would claim to have \u201cthe heart to do this\u201d while simultaneously claiming that he did not want to get caught.

The GOP battered President Barack Obama over his refusal to use the term \u201cIslamic terror,\u201d and yet both Democratic and Republican leaders seem to have a strange nervous tick when it is time to name \u201cwhite domestic terror.\u201d Truth be told, even politicians of color\u2014nourished on a lifelong diet of white movie heroes, Eurocentric school curricula and images of a blond, blue-eyed Jesus\u2014seem conditioned to accept the notion that only \u201cMuslim\u201d terror is real terror.\n\nThe result is that the NRA-backed GOP leaders\u2019 main prescription for keeping us safe is to purchase more guns, somehow trying to convince us that a safe and sane society is one where schoolteachers, church deacons and single mothers must carry pistols and be prepared to engage in impromptu firefights with AR-15-toting lunatics.\n\nSimultaneously, the vast majority of Democratic leaders enthusiastically fund anti-terrorist efforts abroad while remaining silent about the true nature of much of the violence at home, with images of Islamic extremists and black \u201csuperpredators\u201d apparently still dominating their imaginations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly when our government has launched a \u201cwar on white supremacy\u201d and a \u201cwar on gun violence\u201d will we have a true \u201cwar on terror\u201d and become convinced that our safety is truly its main concern.\n\nThe Rev.

The entire indictment focused on how the charged parties used social media to organize pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton rallies and took on fake social media profiles, especially on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nMuch of this was designed to spark racial strife between white people and minority groups in an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election and benefit Trump. The black guys on YouTube dissing Hillary Clinton and the notorious GOP Tennessee Twitter account, among many more of their kind, have been well-covered. Still, there is no evidence that any of these efforts swayed people to vote one way or the other.\n\nBuzzFeed asked experts if they believed that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was responsible for decreased black turnout in 2016, and none of them could say that was the case. Chryl Laird, a government professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, said that turnout was lower in 2016 than in 2012 because black voters simply weren\u2019t as excited about Clinton as they had been about Barack Obama. Instead, 2016 turnout should be compared with that of 2004, when it was more than 60 percent. \u201cObama would be considered a statistical outlier,\u201d Laird told BuzzFeed.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how Twitter bots discouraged black folks, least of all black women, from casting a ballot. Black voter turnout in presidential years has been on the uptick since the the mid-1990s. Of course, Obama was a once-in-a-lifetime president, and therefore, the black turnout would reflect that. In 2012, 66.6 percent of eligible black voters cast ballots, according to the Pew Research Center. That number dipped to 59.6 percent in 2016. That\u2019s just slightly below the 61.4 percent for overall voters that year.\n\nEvery available study finds that black men and women overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. Not sure Russian trolls had much impact. Now, voter suppression is another story. Then there is also this thing about older black folks having to risk their lives to vote and passing that tradition down to their children. If Jim Crow could not stop black folk from voting, I doubt that a Twitter troll would have more impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I also doubt that Twitter bots made Trump supporters more racist. I am sure the Republicans who believed that Obama was a Muslim back in 2015 didn\u2019t need a bot to fuel their hate even more in 2016.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m suspicious of any article that argues Russian bots discouraged black voter turnout or encouraged white folks to be even more racist than they already are.

That they get to walk around in normal society hiding in plain sight is the scary part. Most people of color would rather see a Nazi in full regalia waving a Confederate flag than a police officer with hate hidden in the cavity behind their badge because that is how institutional racism is the real killer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are four stories that shed light on how institutional bias is embedded in the fabric of America, manifesting itself in unseen ways every day:\n\n1. John Kelly calls immigrants \u201ctoo lazy to get off their asses.\u201d\n\nWhen White House chief of staff John Kelly said on Tuesday that the reason for the low number of people who registered for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was \u201cthe people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses,\u201d media outlets immediately pointed out that his statement was kind of racist in the same way that fire is kind of warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2017, after Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), a black woman, called out President Donald Trump on his racist treatment of a war veteran\u2019s wife, Kelly defended his boss by creating a story out of thin air accusing Wilson, a black woman, of basically being too uppity, referring to her as an \u201cempty barrel.\u201d A few days later, Kelly said in an interview that he believed Robert E. Lee, who led a war against his own country to preserve the institution of slavery, was an \u201chonorable man.\u201d Some would say that Kelly fit the description of a Klansman who finally decided to remove his hood.\n\nBut here is the thing that no one seems to mention: John Kelly is a longtime, decorated general in the U.S. Marine Corps. Even though his racism is surfacing only recently, it is unlikely that Kelly cultivated his racist beliefs after signing on as the chief of staff for President Trumpty Dumpty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his entire professional life, Kelly has been in charge of the careers and lives of thousands of black and brown members of the military. While we know that the only thing wypipo love more than dogs and guitar-based music is \u201cthe troops,\u201d it is impossible to now believe that a man who holds prejudice in his heart and mind like a Lynyrd Skynyrd song treated his underlings fairly.\n\nI\u2019m not saying John Kelly definitely took every opportunity to discriminate against the soldiers he was in charge of; I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s what a real racist would do, and Kelly has proved that he is a real racist.\n\n2. The \u201calt-right\u201d is killing people.\n\nWhen the forward-thinking Richard Spencer decided to rebrand white supremacy as the \u201calternative right,\u201d it was a brilliant move. The new name distanced its adherents from the sordid, violent past of their predecessors in an effort to cast themselves as part of a political movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they are still doing the same thing.\n\nA new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center finds that the alt-right is responsible for more than 100 killings or injuries since 2014, including 60 deaths or injuries in 2017 alone. SPLC determined that most of the perpetrators of this violence were young (average age 25) white males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow are these incidents related to institutional racism?\n\nWell, would you call the Federal Bureau of Investigation an \u201cinstitution\u201d? Because it issued a warning to law enforcement agencies around the country against the rise of \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t have a similar designation for white groups.\n\nInstitutions like the Department of Homeland Security issue reports about foreign-born terrorists, but the white boys who kill more people get a pass. The executive branch of the U.S. government is an institution whose powers are enshrined in the Constitution. That\u2019s why they can pre-emptively call for a travel ban from Muslim countries instead of slapping a ban on Confederate flags and white boys who wear trench coats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut those black identity extremists, though.\n\n3. A neo-Nazi turns out to be a fake war veteran.\n\nThe New York Times seems to find Nazis fascinating. It recently did a story on Elliott Kline, a rising figure in the white supremacy movement. The story was about how Kline had convinced so many alt-right followers that he was a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was a sniper who killed \u201cscores of dirty Arabs\u201d (not my words).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that Kline was ... well ... just a regular old original-recipe white boy who had never been deployed during his stint in the National Guard (I told y\u2019all that wypipo love \u201cthe troops\u201d\u2014even Elliott knows). But hidden in the story, glossed over by every outlet that reported the news, was an interesting fact:\n\nKline\u2019s day job was as a \u201chuman resources administrator.\u201d The position is described by Payscale as:\n\nThe first point of contact within a company for all HR-related inquiries. Specific tasks include handling employment contracts, recruiting, and setting up interviews for open positions in the company. Additionally, HR administrators oversee other HR personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nazi. The fake thug.\n\nWhen you read reports like this one from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which shows that job applicants with white-sounding names need to send 10 job applications to get a callback, while those with black-sounding names have to send 15 on average to get a response, this is how that happens. The Economic Policy Institute will tell you that blacks are paid less than whites at every level of education, but no one knows exactly why.\n\nAfrican Americans are paid less than whites at every education level While the economy continues to improve and wages are finally beginning to inch up for most\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk Elliott Kline.\n\n4. Republicans are trying to stop the white genocide.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of the white-genocide theory (no, that is not wishing you could go back in time and make the Kardashians disappear\u2014that\u2019s \u201cJenner-cide\u201d). White genocide is the kooky, white supremacist conspiracy theory that because of diversity efforts, immigration and the potency of black sperm, whites will soon be extinct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, black people say absurd things, too. We talk with too much hyperbole. We all know Republicans can be \u201csemiracist\u201d (\u201csemi\u201d comes from the Latin word that means \u201cas a motherfucker,\u201d right?). But when we call their immigration efforts an \u201cethnic cleansing plan\u201d and say it is the Trump administration\u2019s effort to maintain white people\u2019s precipitous grip on their population majority, perhaps we are going too far. There\u2019s no evidence of that.\n\nWell, actually ...\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump\u2019s immigration plan would delay the date that white people become the minority in the country by as many as five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years the Census Bureau has been saying that people of color will outnumber non-Hispanic whites by 2044. But according to the Post\u2019s analysis, Trump\u2019s proposal could push the date back to as far as 2049.\n\nCouple that with Paul Ryan\u2019s statement Tuesday, which echoes the sentiments of the white genocide theory. When discussing entitlement reform, the fully grown Eddie Munster said, \u201cPeople ... I did my part, but we need to have higher birth rates in this country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite their ridiculous hairstyle choices, these men aren\u2019t fringe kooks in some dark corner of the internet talking shit. These are two of the most powerful men in the world. They not only create and pass legislation\u2014Ryan and Trump can also prevent any bill from becoming law.\n\nThese stories show the difference between racism and white supremacy. While it might be salacious to talk about hate rallies, Confederate statues or white women screaming the n-word in Starbucks, the real-world application of institutional racism is far more insidious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are people who laugh at the discussion of white supremacy like they laugh at people who believe in ghosts. They think we are paranoid. They say we believe it exists even when there is nothing there. But racism is a monster with gnashing teeth lurking in the shadows, harmless and invisible to those who are immune.\n\nOh, what a privilege it must be to have never seen the ghost.", "keywords": ["works", "supremacy", "say", "real", "black", "racist", "whites", "john", "white", "institutional", "kelly", "racism", "roundup"], "polarity": 0.031041552344369255, "subjectivity": 0.4264844896887151},

As Shanice Brim writes, \u201cA lot of nonblack people feel that black issues take up too much space in the racism discussion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe see it all the time in mainstream media\u2014from the Master of None bit in which Aziz Ansari\u2019s Dev Shah complained that \u201cpeople don\u2019t get that fired up about racist Asian or Indian stuff ... you only risk starting a brouhaha if you say something bad about black or gay people,\u201d to Salma Hayek\u2019s shutting down Jessica Williams\u2019 critique of anti-blackness in white feminism by interjecting with an account of her own experience as a (light-skinned) Latina in Hollywood.\n\nIt takes ignoring the singular, ongoing history of racial slavery and the violence of hypervisibility to pin the problems of nonblack people of color on black folks. But it happens again and again\u2014and not just in the world of Hollywood.\n\nFor years, \u201cgoing beyond black and white\u201d has been a catchphrase of nonblack Asian-American and Latinx advocates looking to spotlight their communities\u2019 unique struggles against white supremacy. But as critical race theorist Mari Matsuda has warned, anti-blackness often underlies the rhetoric of moving past the \u201cblack and white binary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatsuda explains: \u201cWhen we say we need to move beyond black and white, this is what a whole lot of people say or feel or think: \u2018Thank goodness we can get off that paradigm, because those black people made me feel so uncomfortable. ... Thank God I don\u2019t have to take those angry black people seriously anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe myth of black privilege has real consequences, fracturing interracial coalitions and making black people the scapegoat for the violence white supremacy enacts on Latinx and Asian-American folks. Behind the thousands of Chinese-American protesters who declared that killer cop Peter Liang was a \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d to Black Lives Matter is the belief that, as one protester put it, \u201cwhite people [are] first-class, black people [are] second-class. ... Chinese [are] no class, or the last class.\u201d Likewise, beneath claims that a \u201cLatino Lives Matter\u201d movement is being stifled by \u201cblack and white\u201d conceptions of race is the twisted notion that black people are somehow responsible for a black-white binary that white people created to enforce their legal status as property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why in 2016, after nonblack people of color asked why Academy Award host Chris Rock wasn\u2019t mentioning Asian-American or Latinx underrepresentation, Mikki Kendall created the brilliant and incisive hashtag #NotYourMule to critique the expectation that black people will do the work for nonblack communities of color that often don\u2019t return the favor.\n\nWhile the hashtag is new, the sentiment isn\u2019t: It\u2019s a paraphrase from Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s 1937 novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. And critiquing the demand for black activists to ally with nonblacks similarly has a long history.\n\nIn 1967, Kwame Ture and Charles V. Hamilton discredited the expectation that Black Power activists should align with \u201cgroups [that] accept the American system and want only\u2014if at all\u2014to make peripheral, marginal reforms in it.\u201d Addressing anti-blackness among nonblack people of color means confronting that same question: Do we want coalitions with black folks only until we can join white people as agents of anti-black and settler-colonial violence? Or do we seek, as Ture and Hamilton wrote, \u201cthe total revamping of society\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to build meaningful coalitions with black activists, we don\u2019t have to start from scratch: There is a long tradition of interracial solidarity movements\u2014from the Chicano and Asian-American activists who stood with Black Panther Party members to free Huey Newton, to recent Black Lives Matter solidarity efforts in which nonblack POC have shut down federal buildings, confronted their family members and fought to hold nonblack POC police officers accountable for the murder of black people.\n\nThis ongoing history of solidarity teaches us that when we come together to honestly confront our unique but intertwined experiences of oppression, we can unlearn the capitalist belief that justice is a limited resource.\n\nBut when it comes to mainstream media representation, it\u2019s easy to feel like we are fighting for scraps. Too often, that leads to nonblack POC using anti-blackness to try to steal the spotlight\u2014like when a group of Asian Americans \u201cborrowed\u201d the #OscarsSoWhite tag for a panel at SXSW without inviting, or even consulting, its creator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, though April Reign has every right to say that #OscarsSoWhite is indeed by and for black people alone, she has taken every opportunity to insist that Hollywood still needs to do better by nonblack Asian Americans and Latinx folks, declaring after last year\u2019s nominations saw an uptick in black nominees that \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\u201d#OscarsSoBlackAndWhite is just another reminder that the labor and leadership of black women too often go unappreciated.\n\nUltimately, the demand for black people to build political coalitions with nonblack people of color is a demand for unreciprocated black labor. Our work to confront Asian-American and Latinx media underrepresentation\u2014and the countless violences our communities face outside of Hollywood\u2014is cut out for us. But let\u2019s be clear: It is our work.\n\n", "keywords": ["work", "color", "oscarssoblackandwhite", "say", "hashtag", "asianamerican", "nonblack", "white", "asian", "myth", "privilege", "black", "latinx"], "polarity": -0.021220289144817425, "subjectivity": 0.4139130523564483},

Oprah undoubtedly is a legend, great orator and motivator, and billionaire, and essentially \u201cqualified\u201d to be president.\n\n\n\nNow she has gone on record to say that she doesn\u2019t plan on running for president. However, this continued desire to have another black face in the White House is something our community needs to reassess as we move closer to the midterm elections and the impending tokenization of the black vote.\n\n\n\nTo be clear: This country is not ready for, nor does it deserve, another black president.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the history. We have had one black president, and for all intents and purposes, Barack Obama did a decent job upholding the standards of the Oval Office. The problem is that these standards are oftentimes rooted in anti-blackness, and no matter the color of the person who adheres to those standards, he or she will inherently continue to hurt black and brown people, both domestic and global. Behind Obama\u2019s charismatic charm, bright smile and Al Green vocals was a man in a position of power that required him to do some very inhumane things.\n\n\n\nYet we are still eager to throw another black face into the White House because colonization has conditioned us to believe in symbolism as an ideology of progress, rather than realize that tokenism of black people within white systems has only been used as a litmus test for what is an acceptable standard of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protection of Obama\u2019s legacy by the black community has already begun, with an attempt to turn a blind eye to the wrongdoings, which is eerily similar to the reverent school lessons about America\u2019s forefathers, despite their complicity in slavery and racism. We can\u2019t allow an omission of the facts simply because Obama is black.\n\nIn addition to the good, Obama will be remembered for the thousands killed in drone strikes he ordered and the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants by any president in our history. Again, this is part of the job of running a white, imperialist nation. Yet we are still eager to throw another black face into the White House because colonization has conditioned us to believe in symbolism as an ideology of progress, rather than realize that tokenism of black people within white systems has only been used as a litmus test for what is an acceptable standard of blackness.\n\n\n\nHari Ziyad touches on this idea in his piece, \u201cWhy I Don\u2019t Want Another Black President,\u201d when he states: \u201cBut while giving black folks the fleeting empowerment of representation, Barack Obama did very little to challenge white society\u2014at least much less than he did to support it. His final acts as president, for example, will not be to pardon black freedom fighters-turned-political prisoners and fugitives like Nehanda Abiodun, but to ensure the smooth transition of power to his virulently anti-black successor.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe fail ourselves every time we place the burden of our freedom in elected officials\u2014especially those who are black and required to serve the white majority. Once in office, they continue to enforce laws that are inherently anti-black, which is in direct conflict with why many of us voted for them in the first place.\n\nOur failure is that we continue to try to work within a system that was created without the intention of ensuring equity or equality among races. Hundreds of years of evidence to the contrary, we continue to place our hopes in those like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who will eventually succumb to the pressures of the system that uses them as pawns of \u201cprogress\u201d to dehumanize those who aren\u2019t able or willing to assimilate into whiteness as they have.\n\n\n\nThe two-party system from which they operate has never served black communities well. Having the option of Democrat or Republican is often about choosing the lesser of two evils, despite the color of the person running for office. The pandering for our vote over the last 50 years has given us nothing but empty promises, mass incarceration, health care discrimination and a median family wealth that could drop to zero for African Americans in 2053.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all of this, hope is not lost for those willing to invest in politics when it really matters. That means, as black folks, we can\u2019t wait every four years to be interested in what is going on in our country. We also shouldn\u2019t be waiting every two years for the midterm elections to get involved.\n\nFirst we must begin supporting local grassroots organizations that are on the ground attempting to make changes that will have national implication, while also divesting from systems of oppression in an effort to dismantle them; we need to begin anew with systems not built on anti-blackness.\n\nBlack folks have to become more than the swing vote that decides which evil gets to run the white imperialist empire.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis country is not built for, nor does it deserve to have, a black man, woman or gender-nonconforming person as president. Nearly 400 years of history have taught us that this system will not bring about freedom.\n\nThe time is now that we demand a change, starting with ourselves and how we do politics.

It is impossible to comprehend the far-reaching effects of the all-American tradition of racism without a holistic examination.\n\n\n\nOr you can just look at what happened this week.\n\nA Trump nominee has no idea if racial bias exists in the justice system.\n\nDuring his Wednesday Senate confirmation hearings, Michael Brennan, a white lawyer who has been nominated to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, repeatedly dodged questions from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) about racial bias in the justice system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo you think implicit racial bias exists in our criminal-justice system?\u201d Booker asked the Wisconsin lawyer.\n\n\u201cI would indicate only that I would do my very best as a judge to ensure that no biases came in,\u201d Brennan replied caucasianally. Booker asked him again:\n\nYou\u2019re aware that African Americans are stopped more than whites for drug searches in this country? That there\u2019s no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or dealing drugs, but [blacks] are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for it? You\u2019re aware of the data, I imagine, that says African Americans are more likely to get mandatory minimum sentences for the same crime? You\u2019re probably aware of the data that African Americans are more likely to serve more time for similar crimes ... You\u2019re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal-justice system? I find this astonishing.\n\nIf confirmed, Brennan would have a lifetime appointment to a court that has heard cases concerning sanctuary cities, voting rights, police brutality and the deportation of immigrants in this month alone. Brennan also served as a trial judge on a Milwaukee circuit court for nine years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study shows bias in the criminal-justice system at every level. The study collected years of data on convictions, arrests, pleas and sentencing from\u2014you guessed it\u2014Wisconsin.\n\nWhite extremists kill more cops, but the FBI tracks black groups more closely.\n\nSince 1990, white supremacists and far-right extremists have killed 50 law-enforcement officers in the U.S., according to a recent report by the Anti-Defamation League. The report notes that left-wing groups, including \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d have killed 11 officers during that period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the FBI issued an August 2017 report entitled, \u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers\u201d (pdf), warning 18,000 local and state agencies around the country of the threat posed by black groups. It has not issued an equivalent report for the far more dangerous right-wing groups, but, to be fair, the FBI doesn\u2019t have an equivalent designation for white identity extremists.\n\n\u201cThis document essentially says we don\u2019t care about your ideology, we care about your black identity,\u201d Michael German, a former FBI agent who worked in the counterterrorism division, told the Miami Herald. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous classification that could encompass any violence by a black person.\u201d\n\nAlthough the FBI says it does not monitor groups based on speech, German notes that the threshold for surveillance is so low that the agency\u2019s report can be used to justify watching black organizations and monitoring black protests more closely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorrections officers exchanged racist messages while the Sheriff\u2019s Office stayed silent.\n\nA sergeant at the Santa Clara County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Office is waiting for an arbitrator to decide whether he should have been removed from his job for not reporting racist texts and emails from corrections officers in the county jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mercury News, Don Morrissey worked at the facility and did nothing to stop a group of about eight officers and one deputy from exchanging messages that included calling Jews \u201ckikes\u201d and black people \u201cniggers\u201d and \u201cyard apes.\u201d In one text, an officer said, \u201cWe could hang a nigger in Haiti for about 75 bucks tops.\u201d Another officer texted, \u201cCops have already killed 550 people in 2015,\u201d to which another responded, \u201cIf they\u2019re black, it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nThe case is significant because the officer never sent any of the racial epithets (although he joined in on the conversations), but tolerated a racist environment. Morrissey argues that many of the texts were sent while the officers were not on duty. He added that\u2014even though he knew about the texts\u2014he should not be responsible for the conduct of others, which is a valid point, except for one thing:\n\nMorrissey is president of the Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Association of Santa Clara County!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is how institutional racism works. It is not about crosses on lawns or marches in Charlottesville, Va. However despicable those things might seem, they are far less impactful than the subtle tyranny of unseen bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be black in America is to walk a minefield of white supremacy, never knowing where racism might explode and rip you apart. It is buried in at least one teacher in every school. It sits behind the benches of courtrooms across the country. It is in chambered in the guns and hearts of police officers everywhere.\n\nInstitutional racism is not a problem that can be cured with a \u201cconversation about race.\u201d It is an American contagion for which there is no cure\u2014an unseen microscopic virus that infects white people and kills black people.\n\nIt is not being called a \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\nIt is the everlasting, invisible scourge of being treated like one.", "keywords": ["system", "know", "fbi", "need", "racial", "week", "happened", "institutional", "white", "groups", "likely", "racism", "black", "officers", "report"], "polarity": 0.05744444444444439, "subjectivity": 0.39675555555555553},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food.

During a meeting between the two Republicans, Minor began asking Harold questions about her sexuality and her marital status, asking, \u201cAre you a lesbo?\u201d multiple times. The conversation reportedly turned heated when Minor \u201cused the full n-word.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to state Republicans, Illinois House leader Peter Breen wrote that Minor confirmed the details of the conversation and his use of the slurs to Breen. To be fair, though, Breen says that Minor claims he had a good reason:\n\nAt an in-person meeting that Mr. Minor requested with me, with a witness present, Mr. Minor confirmed that he had asked Ms. Harold if she was a lesbian and that he had used the full n-word in her and her assistant\u2019s presence. He explained this away by claiming that Ms. Harold \u201cwanted him to ask the question\u201d about her sexual orientation and claiming that Ms. Harold asked him to say the full n-word. Suffice it to say, this is not how the other participants to the meeting heard or understood the statements, nor how they reported those statements to others both immediately after the meeting occurred and consistently in the months since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitico confirmed the conversation with multiple sources, saying that Minor asked the questions so he could \u201cget it on the record,\u201d and while Minor would not comment to Politico, he earlier insisted that he did not use the \u201cfull n-word\u201d because he and Harold are friends.\n\nWhich brings up a great point:\n\nWhat the hell is \u201cthe full n-word\u201d? It is repeatedly mentioned by the people in this controversy, but I have no idea what it is. Did the town chairman simply emphasize the \u201cr\u201d at the end of the word, or it possible that there is a longer, more detestable version of \u201cnigger\u201d that white people have been keeping secret all these years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Burt Minor call Erika Harold a \u201cniggerilla\u201d?\n\nIllinois Republicans are now rescinding their endorsements from Minor because, while Republicans have no problem passing racist, homophobic legislation and injecting it into their political agenda, they can\u2019t have a party member walking around using the full n-word.\n\nWhich brings up a greater point:\n\nIf you\u2019re a black Republican, shouldn\u2019t you expect to be called the n-word? It\u2019s like hiring Bill Cosby to bartend at a slumber party or asking R. Kelly to chaperone a junior high school dance\u2014you know what\u2019s going to happen.

The Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center for Extremism reports that right-wing extremists were responsible for 71 percent of all extremist-related deaths in the U.S. last year.\n\nOf the 34 extremist-related murders, most (18) were committed by white supremacists, including the death of Richard W. Collins III, a Bowie State University student killed hours before his graduation by Sean Urbanski, and the fatal stabbing of two people by Jeremy Christian during a racist rant aboard a Portland train.\n\nDespite the hype of conservatives around the country, many of last year\u2019s nominees failed miserably. Black Lives Matter, a group that many whites want so badly to be considered a terrorist organization, failed to kill a single individual in 2017, as it has during every year of its existence. Antifa, which President Donald Trump condemned as one of the groups in Charlottesville, Va., that had very bad people \u201con both sides,\u201d did not cause a death last year. More tragically, the Anti-Defamation League could not find anyone who died or was even critically injured by a professional football player who kneeled during the national anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the ADL did find two incidents of extremism by the mythical \u201cblack supremacist\u201d movement. In April, Kori Muhammad went on a shooting spree in Fresno, Calif. Muhammad\u2019s father said that he was trying to start a war between black and whites.

There was the B.A.P.S-like duo of Diamond and Silk and the greasy-headed preacher Darrell Scott. And there was 2017\u2019s real-life Stephen from Django: Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who seemed to hate everything even remotely uplifting and black. And who could forget talking head Katrina Pierson, who was the black Kellyanne Conway before we knew who Kellyanne Conway was.\n\nSince he took office, it appears that, like many of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, his favorite blacks have disappeared. So we\u2019ve decided to take a look at what happened to some of them and see what they\u2019ve been up to since the devil\u2019s apocalypse took office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatrina Pierson\n\nPierson was like 1995 Puff Daddy\u2014the Puffy that Suge Knight hated\u2014because she was \u201call up in the videos.\u201d When Trump was running for office, it was Pierson who proved to be not only one of his biggest supporters but also one of his staunchest defenders. It was reported that during Sean Spicer\u2019s (we miss you, Spicy Facts!) tenure, Pierson was offered the deputy press secretary post but turned it down believing that she could be more effective outside the White House.\n\nPierson now works for a nonprofit launched by Trump allies called America First Policies, which includes several Trump campaign veterans, The Hill reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders would ultimately become the deputy press secretary, but let\u2019s just take a second and think about the dream team that Spicy Facts and Pierson could\u2019ve been.\n\n\n\nSheriff David Clarke\n\nWhite America has always had a hard-on for blacks who believe other blacks just need to work harder, stop complaining and pull themselves up and blah, blah. ... Blacks have a name for these blacks as well, and while that name isn\u2019t fit to print, let\u2019s just say that Clarke moved himself up Trump\u2019s \u201clikable blacks ladder\u201d by being tough on blacks. He likened the Black Lives Matter movement to terrorism and went nuts on Don Lemon during a segment on BLM.\n\nIn the end, Clarke\u2019s self-hatred was enough to propel him into a potential position in the Department of Homeland Security, except the job stalled after Clarke was accused of plagiarizing his master\u2019s thesis, and it was found that the conditions in his jails left one mentally ill inmate dead. Although the job didn\u2019t appear to be available, Clarke ultimately turned it down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Clarke seems to be caping for his master, President Donald Von Douche Face, on Twitter.\n\nMark Burns\n\nSouth Carolina pastor Mark Burns had become one of Trump\u2019s go-to opening acts during his campaign rallies and his run to the White House\u2014that is, until it was learned that Burns, much like the president, was a fraud and a huckster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurns claimed on his church\u2019s website that he had a Bachelor of Science and had served six years in the Army Reserve. CNN found that he was never in the Army Reserve and served only in the National Guard until he was discharged in 2008. And not only did Burns not have a bachelor\u2019s from North Greenville University\u2014he\u2019d attended the school for only one semester.\n\nBurns copped to his lies, claiming that he started his church as a young man and embellished his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so that he could be taken seriously. He also lied about being a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. Honestly, if you\u2019re having a bad day, just watch the video below, which shows Burns going down in a glorious hail of misery and lies.\n\nIt looks as if Burns has taken his sideshow to social media since being exposed. He\u2019s still riding on the success that he once had from holding the president\u2019s nuts and is using his faux celebrity to shoot videos inside a Paul Mitchell hair salon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamond and Silk\n\nDiamond and Silk aren\u2019t deplorables, though they should be. They\u2019re the affable black women who seem as sweet as a Patti LaBelle pie and love Donald Trump the way flies love old picnic food. I see them more as opportunists. Maybe they really love Trump, maybe they don\u2019t\u2014who knows\u2014but the whole bit of them being all blackity-black while loving up president racism feels like a put-on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd man, do they do it up. They feel like a throwback to a time when black people wore blackface. Nevertheless, Diamond and Silk are a thing. A thing that I wish was not a thing. They are two women sitting in a living room in North Carolina who don\u2019t see themselves as African Americans (they are Americans!) and don\u2019t believe that their president lies. Seriously\u2014watch them below:\n\nSince Trump took the White House, Diamond and Silk have taken a back seat, which I\u2019m sure is fine with them. They have become a sideshow attraction, making impassioned speeches at Trump rallies because the president is still rallying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike many of Trump\u2019s favorite blacks, Diamond and Silk were not gifted a position in the White House. But all is not lost. They do have a web store that sells such highly coveted items as a blinged-out Trump pin and a coffee mug with their faces on it.\n\nOmarosa Manigault\n\nMan, I just knew that she was going to be the Spliff Starr to Trump\u2019s Busta Rhymes. I expected her and Trump to be in shiny sweatsuits doing the Rollie dance, like this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and Omarosa were supposed to be the real Diamond and Silk, except that Trump started balling out, and, well, it\u2019s like Omarosa got spooked and left Harlem to join a church.\n\nDa fuq happened to Omarosa?!\n\nRight after Trump won, she was out here talking about how Congress members better watch their steps because the administration was keeping a hit list, and now she\u2019s said about as much as Clarence Thomas has since he joined the Supreme Court. I must admit, for someone who has made her bones by being loud and at most times wrong, I\u2019m a little disappointed that Omarosa hasn\u2019t been a more central figure in this dysfunctional administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving this Omarosa in the White House is like Bobby Brown joining a cocaine-fueled supergroup with K-Ci, Jo-Jo and any DeBarge, but instead of doing coke and \u201csanging,\u201d he\u2019s taking quiet naps and reading A Song of Ice and Fire. I\u2019m going to need The Apprentice Omarosa to come back.\n\nShe\u2019s working in the White House as a political aide and traveling with the president and giving interviews like this. Also, word is that she\u2019s taken to calling herself the \u201cHonorable Omarosa Manigault,\u201d which means that the old Omarosa is still in there\u2014we\u2019re just waiting for her to come all the way out.\n\nPastor Darrell Scott\n\nThis greasy bama is proof that life comes at you fast. One minute he was all up in Trump Tower hobnobbing with the future president, and the next he was being sued over back rent. That\u2019s right\u2014Trump\u2019s favorite pastor, the pastor who claimed that \u201ctop gang thugs\u201d had reached out to him because of his relationship with the president (which turned out to be a lie), was being sued for \u201c$563,000 in unpaid rent and fees.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to News 5 Cleveland, Scott entered an agreement with the owner to pay weekly installments on the $2 million home and, after six years of living in the residence, had fallen behind on payments. Scott called the lawsuit \u201cfake\u201d\u2014wonder where he got that from.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see. My attorney feels like this is 110 percent guaranteed,\u201d Scott\u2019s former landlord Munna Argarwal told the news station. \u201cIf he\u2019s calling it a fake deal or a fake lawsuit, he\u2019s definitely a con artist.\u201d\n\nBen Carson\n\nArguably Trump\u2019s most favorite black, Carson has taken a job in Trump\u2019s Cabinet as the secretary of housing and urban development, a job that he initially claimed to be unqualified to hold. Since taking the position, he has called poverty \u201ca state of mind\u201d and added that Trump\u2019s drama has made it easier to \u201cget stuff done\u201d in his job. Oh, he\u2019s also added that he doesn\u2019t want to make low-income housing too cozy because he doesn\u2019t believe in government assistance being a handout, but rather, a hand up.

If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday.

I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["conservative", "cpac", "sure", "conservatives", "list", "political", "im", "trumps", "video", "trump", "white", "convention", "introduce", "used", "black", "nigger", "watch", "pretty", "republican"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

Like, say, why she enters every interview as if she\u2019s Sensational Queen Sherri and everyone else is Miss Elizabeth or Sweet Sapphire.\n\nIndeed, very few ordained ministers maneuver like Omarosa, who seemingly resides in a constant state of \u201cWho the fuck want war?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that Jesus hasn\u2019t tapped her on the shoulder and enjoined her to partake in a tall glass of chill still confuses me, but other matters pertaining to her are much more clear. Like, when it comes to her work with the Colby-Jack F\u00fchrer, it\u2019s a no-brainer: She\u2019s an opportunist. Of course, she is loyal to the man who gave her the platform to become famous, but for all the criticism lodged at her, she is many things, though fool has never been one of them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve found the articles centered on black Republicans\u2019 frustration with her wonderfully comical. The latest comes from the Washington Post with the article, \u201cOmarosa Manigault Is in Trump\u2019s White House Because of Her Loyalty. But What Is She Doing There?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe same thing as everyone else, Pinky: not a damn thing.\n\n\n\nVanessa Williams (one assumes not the one who had the legendary performance on The Arsenio Hall Show) writes:\n\nSome African American political insiders already have concluded that she is ineffective, and she is routinely derided on social media as simply providing cover for a president deeply unpopular with African Americans. Some black Republicans were particularly critical of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the HBCU initiative, which included a White House meeting with the school officials that some viewed as little more than a photo op for the president. \u201cShe raised expectations too high, and now it\u2019s turned into a negative,\u201d said Raynard Jackson, a longtime Republican strategist. \u201cThis shows a lack of political understanding. This is Politics 101.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo any of the people in the White House know what they\u2019re doing? Between those executive orders, the half-assed shot at dismantling Obamacare and the Twitter-egg prez shooting various conspiracy theories from the hip, Omarosa fits right in.\n\nFor months now, there have been multiple stories about Omarosa\u2019s role in the administration\u2014how she is useless or how she angers black Republicans.\n\n\n\nLast month, Joy-Ann Reid wrote, \u201cWhy Does Everybody Seem to Hate Omarosa Manigault?\u201d for the Daily Beast. In sum, the second verse is same as the first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReid notes:\n\nThis lifelong black Republican likened bringing in Omarosa to a Democratic president putting \u201990s-era anti-affirmative action crusader Ward Connerly in their administration. \u201cHe\u2019s got a black Democrat who hasn\u2019t produced a single [Congressional Black Caucus] member to support any nominee that has been appointed,\u201d this person continued. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t produced anybody on the Democratic side who is willing to be supportive of anything that Trump has done. So what is her role?\u201d They added: \u201cShe has no mission or goal other than to make Omarosa the head sister in charge.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst off, Omarosa isn\u2019t a magician, and even if she were, there\u2019s no spell in the world that would spare a black Democrat from the wrath of Rep. Maxine Waters, who, like the legendary Kimberly Jones, has no time for fake ones. As far as \u201cthe head sister in charge\u201d goes: 1) I\u2019m offended a black Republican would talk like this; 2) aren\u2019t most of the people in the White House operating from self-interest?\n\nIvanka Trump is trying to do her spin of Hillary Clinton\u2019s guide to using her time as first lady to launch a future political career. Her husband, Jared Kushner, is operating both like a fake-ass Karl Rove and a shadow secretary of state. Grand Wizard Steve Bannon has never made it a secret that he sees 45 as a vessel to help promote his agenda.\n\nOmarosa isn\u2019t all that different, though Reid does pinpoint the real grievance:\n\nThe real source of consternation among her detractors is what they view as her role as gatekeeper; slamming the White House doors on them. Many black GOPers opposed Trump during the Republican primaries, and some continued to do so right through Election Day. But they say that while some white \u201cnever Trumpers\u201d and Trump critics have been forgiven, and some have even been rewarded\u2014Kellyanne Conway used to slam Trump on TV on a regular basis when she was a Ted Cruz supporter, and is now counselor to the president\u2014most black Republicans with policy and political histories dating back to the first Bush administration have been cut out. And they laid the blame at Omarosa\u2019s designer shoe-clad feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuzzFeed\u2019s Darren Sands has offered similar findings in his reporting in two separate pieces for Buzzfeed.\n\nIn \u201cOmarosa Angers Black Republicans With Invite-Only Meeting,\u201d Sands writes:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe root issue is black Republicans have no leverage in the party outside of personal relationships,\u201d Charles Badger, a former Jeb Bush campaign staffer with ties to prominent black Republicans, who supported Hillary Clinton during the campaign, said in an email to BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt\u2019s because everyone knows black Republicans aren\u2019t representative of most black folks. So the assumption\u2014often true, but sometimes not\u2014is that there\u2019s not the depth of relationships there. So if you want to talk to black folks, are you going to go to black Republicans or through the NAACP, Urban League, black Greek letter organizations, clergy, etc., groups with wider reach?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, as dense as the man who sits in the Oval Office is, even he isn\u2019t dumb enough to believe that black Republicans have any real sway. Granted, it\u2019s hard to envision 45 having a sincere concern about the plight of black people based on his longtime history of racism, but nonetheless, black Republicans don\u2019t have much in the way of capital, not even among actual Republicans.\n\n\n\nWhile I have written critically of Omarosa aligning herself with a bigoted campaign, she did not do so with naivete. She is keenly aware of the tokenism at hand, but she did so for the sake of a lofty White House title\u2014director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison\u2014and all that comes with it. Omarosa would never have gotten this in a Clinton White House, so she got on the team that could afford her what used to come across as the implausible. Many of us would never sacrifice our morals in this manner, but at the very least, Omarosa knows exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\nSo when I read black conservatives blasting her, again, it reads comically. The problem isn\u2019t her; the GOP hasn\u2019t taken black people seriously for decades. For these black conservatives to pretend otherwise is silly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe party of voter suppression wants to help black folks out? When do they do any type of outreach with even the most socially conservative sects of our community? Sure, they champion Tim Scott when convenient, but he\u2019s the same person who supported Jeff Sessions.\n\n\n\nIn \u201cWhy Is President Trump\u2019s Only Senior Black Staffer a Democrat?\u201d Raynard Jackson goes as far back as Richard Nixon (insert laugh track) to tout the GOP\u2019s black outreach. The man who employed the Southern strategy and accelerated mass incarceration is the best template? Even if you want to snuggle next to some of Nixon\u2019s other accomplishments, that was decades ago. What has your party done for y\u2019all lately, beloveds?\n\n\n\nHave your small government views all you want, but if you are a black person in a party that oozes outright racism constantly and consistently for decades, who are you to critique Omarosa\u2019s usefulness? If we\u2019re out here doling out unsolicited advice, one imagines that being a conservative nuisance like West Virginia Senator and barely Democrat Joe Manchin might get you further along in achieving your goals than pretending that 45, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell care. Actually, never mind: Suffer under your self-created burdens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, Omarosa knows exactly what the scam is and is aligning with it for a come-up. You know, just like her mentor Habanero Hitler, who used to be a Democrat but only fell into right side of thinking for careerist goals. Those two are one and the same. They\u2019re both self-serving, but not completely deluded.\n\nThe game is the game. Omarosa may have sold out, but she never bought into the mythology that the GOP in its current state cares about \u201cthe blacks.\u201d What a pity others continue to look away from the obvious.\n\n", "keywords": ["republicans", "believe", "foolish", "president", "political", "omarosa", "trump", "gop", "mad", "white", "black", "fault", "theyre", "house", "democrat", "republican"], "polarity": 0.04145359417652406, "subjectivity": 0.3944334398792994},

The city where he was born and where he lived didn\u2019t even try to honor King until Robert Woodruff, president of Coca-Cola, decided to sponsor a banquet. He still couldn\u2019t get the white elite to attend until the New York Times wrote a scathing article about the efforts to undermine the event and Coca-Cola threatened to leave the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the tickets sold out, many people assumed that King would take it easy on the powerful people who had reluctantly gathered to honor him. When he gave his speech, he spoke directly to the powerful men who had remained quiet during the brutality of the civil rights movement:\n\nHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was wrong, though.\n\nHistory has yet to record the tragedy of the people who sat silently in the room on Thursday when Trump besmirched the nation of Haiti and other black and brown countries. History still has not listed the names in the room when he said that Haitians \u201call have AIDS\u201d and Nigerians live in huts. Their names are nowhere to be found alongside the list of neo-Nazis and Klansmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was King incorrect when he assured us of history\u2019s note-taking, but he was doubly wrong when he described the people who remained appallingly silent as \u201cgood people.\u201d Sidestepping evil for the sake of political favor or not upsetting the apple cart is the opposite of \u201cgood.\u201d These people are co-conspirators. They are accomplices. They are guilty of aiding and abetting by providing material support to white supremacy.\n\nNot only are they at fault, but they join a long list of those complicit with Trump\u2019s brand of racism. Their names should appear alongside those of the pearl-clutching congregation of reporters, celebrities and generic-label white people distancing themselves from \u201cthe Donald\u201d as they pretend to just realize that he has racist tendencies.\n\nThey should register with the 53 percent of white women who voted for a robeless Klansman, along with the lawmakers who embrace him and his policies. The names of kowtowing Negroes like Steve Harvey, Ray Lewis, Stephen A. Smith, Omarosa Manigault Newman and Chrisette Michele, who implored us to respect a man who would shit down our throats for the spectacle of it, should be etched into those history books, too. They all worked on the road crew that paved the way for a white supremacist to gain respect and power. They paid for the fuel in his car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why I am never ashamed to say that I voted for someone just because he or she is black.

Racism is evil.\n\nThose same silent voices omitted from history will probably participate in the praising of Martin Luther King Jr. this weekend. They will talk about freedom and equality for all people. They will do it loudly and publicly because they know that they will always have the opportunity to slit our throats behind closed doors without a single objection.\n\nOur only hope remains in the unseen recompense of the invisible, omnipotent God who King believed would avenge the sins of these evil men.

What I meant to type was: Star Parker was asked to testify before the House subcommittee because she is one of the rare black female Republican anti-abortion-rights activists. (No, I will not use the GOP marketing phrase \u201cpro-life.\u201d Who\u2019s not for people living?)\n\nThe hearing was about the Heartbeat Protection Act\u2014the newest Republican effort to outlaw abortion. The bill would strip women of their right to choose to terminate a pregnancy if a doctor detected a heartbeat. The bill is being considered by a diverse subcommittee of seven white men and a white woman (pdf).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, Parker went into a speech (pdf) that was half Hotep, half Alex Jones. Here is the good part:\n\nIn fact, when you put the Dred Scott decision next to the Roe v. Wade decision, they read almost verbatim. I\u2019d like to also address something that was brought up earlier ... when it comes to mixing the abortion issue with the challenges that we face in many of our hard-hit communities. I feel it disingenuous that the issues of Medicaid would come up, and other opportunities for us to readdress what has happened in ... our most distressed zip codes. The way that Planned Parenthood targets these particular zip codes with abortion. Abortion is the leading cause of death in the black community today. Since Roe v. Wade was legalized, 20 million humans have been killed inside of the womb of black women. And then on Halloween, Planned Parenthood tweets out that the black women are safest if they abort their child rather than bring it to term. To the gentleman from Texas who brought up Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, I think that is important that we put in record that the needs of those that are most vulnerable in society cannot be addressed with abortion. Abortion feeds a narrative that women are victims, that they have no control over their sexual impulses. And the result of this narrative being forced down into our hardest-hit communities\u2014we are seeing now recklessness in sexual activity and marriage has collapsed. In the \u201950s, 70 percent of black adults were married. Today that number is 30 percent. This is causing a lot more social pathologies that have to be addressed in different types of legislation, not the \u201cheartbeat bill.\u201d The heartbeat bill is to protect the innocent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter hearing this, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) got upset and told Parker: \u201cI am not disingenuous about anything I say about Medicaid or Medicare ... or SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] programs.\u201d Cohen went on to say: \u201cAnd to suggest I\u2019m disingenuous shows your ignorance or your absolute inability to deal with congresspeople the way they should. I believe in those issues and I think they\u2019re proper, and to say I\u2019m disingenuous is just wrong and I expect an apology.\u201d\n\nPeople were shocked to hear him go after a black woman publicly like this, but here is the thing:\n\nShe is kinda ignorant, though.\n\nFirst of all, the Dred Scott decision is nothing like Roe v. Wade. I feel as if most of her talking points came off Infowars or from a bad spoken-word poem about Willie Lynch. Second, that \u201cleading cause of death\u201d statistic is an old myth that people use at their leisure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201calt-right\u201d says the leading cause of death in black communities is black people. Republicans say it\u2019s abortions. If you ask Tyrese Gibson, he would get teary-eyed and say the leading cause of death in his community is the Rock breaking up the Fast and Furious franchise, leaving Tyrese penniless. Then he would break down and start bawling about losing his baby. What I\u2019m trying to say is: Everyone has an agenda.\n\nAfter things got heated, the white supremacist anal wart Rep.

I\u2019m not really certain what a Black Republican is, but 13% of African American men voted for Donald Trump in effort to elongate the oppression over the past 400 years and set back the Civil Rights Movement, so I do know that they exist.\n\nLeading that charge for our eradication nightly is the crusty lipped bandit and CNN GOP political commentator Paris Dennard aka, the voice of Black people who wish they were white when assimilation is not enough. Nothing pains me more than to cut on CNN nightly and watch the ashy chapped lips of Dennard refute everything logical about being a Black man in America in effort to sway the opinion that Trump has our best interest at heart. He has night in and night out defended Trump\u2019s agenda as it continues to oppress the marginalized and shown that he is just as delusional as the millions of Black men who checked off Trump on the ballot box. Dennard however is not new to being a coon in the Republican Party, and has a long history of fuckery to back it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 2005 \u2013 2009 Paris served under the Bush Administration as *drum roll please* The White House Director of Black Outreach where he was the liaison to the Black community at large.

Much like current Director Omorosa, Paris, during that era deflected, lied, conjured, and spread alternative facts about how much the GOP was doing for Black America. Evident in how many Black and brown folk were hurt economically during the Bush administration, you would think it would pull Paris from that \u201csunken place\u201d, but instead he opened the door to suck more negroes in and 8 years later, we have Trump.\n\nMy final straw with Dennard occurred a few weeks ago when he proclaimed loud and proud that Trump was in fact doing more for HBCU\u2019s than President Obama. Now let\u2019s be clear, Obama didn\u2019t do much on the HBCU front so I\u2019m not even going to go there. However, when you look at the fact that Trump has cut 3.9 billion in Pell Grant funding intersected with major cuts to HUD; this could easily be the final days of HBCU\u2019s. He got into a spat with Angela Rye and Don Lemon over the issue when they made the valid point of Black folk having to choose to shelter and feed their kids over sending them to HBCU\u2019s.\n\nHe insisted that Lemon was \u201cputting down\u201d HBCU\u2019s by saying housing was more important than college. He also insisted that Trump signing the order in front of all those HBCU President\u2019s was a step toward progress, as if every president prior hadn\u2019t signed that same order. So we are all clear, Black students and HBCU\u2019s survive on Pell funding. IDGAF what Trump signed in front of those HBCU presidents, this type of funding cut could destroy a pillar and tradition over 150 years in the Black community. My hatred for him grew deeper as he defended O\u2019Reilly and Spicer using the \u201cwhy does everything have to be about race line\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDennard represents the worst part of assimilation. Black folk who think that white people are looking past the color of their skin, don\u2019t believe in the \u201crace card\u201d, think that white folk just need a chance \u201cto grow\u201d. Following the long line of Blacks in the sunken place like Clarence Thomas and Ben Carson, Dennard is used as a voice of the Black people by white people who want to be validated in their lackluster efforts, rather than be called out for their bullshit. He is the face of \u201clook, see how one of you Negros made it by being respectable\u201d rather than fighting for our existence and culture to be preserved as we are.\n\nSo from one Black voice in the community to another, fuck you Paris Dennard. Fuck the elitist, respectable Negro politics for which you have built your entire facade of a career on. People like you are why we have to stay out in these streets fighting for our rights while you trying to prove that we have already overcome. I\u2019m tired of Black pundits having to battle you night in and night out.\n\nIt\u2019s time for you catch fade.\n\nGeorge M Johnson is a black queer journalist and activist.

So mad, in fact, that the university felt the need to put at least two campus police officers on guard during the class\u2019s first session Tuesday as a precaution.\n\n\u201cWe have prepared for any possible distractions related to Tuesday\u2019s first class of the White Racism course, but we are expecting normal campus civility as our students engage in this and other courses at the spring semester\u2019s start,\u201d Susan Evans, FGCU\u2019s spokeswoman and chief of staff, told the News-Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe course is is designed to \u201cinterrogate the concept of race; examine the racist ideologies, laws, policies, and practices that have operated for hundreds of years to maintain white racial domination over those racialized as non-white; and discuss ways to challenge white racism and white supremacy toward promoting an anti-racist society where whiteness is not tied to greater life chances,\u201d according to the university website.\n\nTed Thornhill, assistant professor of sociology, will be leading the class. Since news about the course started making the rounds across the nation, he has received countless disturbing emails and voicemails. A few students who had enrolled in the class even approached him to address safety concerns.\n\nAnd so Thornhill sent FGCU police some 46 pages of emails, along with a few voicemails, as a precaution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think most of us don\u2019t anticipate there being any unrest or protest or anything like that,\u201d Thornhill said. \u201cBut it\u2019s more of a prudent measure to have law enforcement present just in case.\u201d\n\nWhile, according to the News-Press, none of the messages actually threatened violence or interruptions of the class, they definitely weren\u2019t pleasant, and some flat out wished ill upon him.\n\n\u201cI can call a black man a nigger when it\u2019s appropriate, and I do,\u201d one of the callers said in one of the voicemails. \u201cI am not ashamed of it.

It\u2019s good to be cautious.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is unclear whether the bolstered security will continue throughout the semester; Thornhill has declined to confirm.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we would share many of those details for individuals who have negative intentions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that we will be safe and that students don\u2019t have anything to worry about except for completing their reading and doing their work and engaging with the material.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the News-Press.", "keywords": ["stirred", "university", "say", "think", "guard", "thornhill", "campus", "racist", "class", "white", "things", "racism", "officers", "controversy", "students", "voicemails", "florida"], "polarity": 0.03333333333333333, "subjectivity": 0.4367424242424242},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["conservative", "cpac", "sure", "conservatives", "list", "political", "im", "trumps", "video", "trump", "white", "convention", "introduce", "used", "black", "nigger", "watch", "pretty", "republican"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

A mix of pick-up trucks and sedans flying the Confederate Battle Flag began to trickle in. In a few minutes, the manager of the Walmart, flanked by multiple police officers, would ask them to leave. (\u201cIt\u2019s private property,\u201d he\u2019d say.) But at 10:30 am, a group of about 15 Dixie Freedom Riders were still huddled in a circle, puffing on cigarettes and preparing to drive a few miles north to Memphis, where they would protest what they considered the illegal removal of two Confederate monuments.\n\nLast month, the Memphis city council voted in favor of transferring ownership of two public parks to a recently formed non-profit organization called Greenspace, Inc, who bought them for $1,000 each. Within hours of the vote on December 20, the city had removed statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and Confederate general (and early Ku Klux Klan member) Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, a Facebook group calling itself Confederate 901 put out a call for protesters to meet in Memphis on January 6. But after missing the city\u2019s deadline to apply for a protest permit, Confederate 901 decided instead to caravan through Memphis and display Confederate flags from their vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring the African-American community and the white community\u2014you know, all communities together as one,\u201d said Confederate supporter Renee Land as she waited in the Walmart parking lot Saturday morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our history removed. If you\u2019re going to remove that statue, then let\u2019s just go all over entire United States to remove every statue we have.\u201d\n\nBilly Sessions, a Confederate activist and an organizer of the Memphis protest, also disavowed any association with white nationalist groups.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Confederacy, the history has been twisted on that, but we\u2019re all Southerners,\u201d Sessions said later. \u201cNo matter what color you are, we\u2019re all Southerners. It\u2019s not about racism. It might have been about racism hundreds of years ago when the slave ships come across the Atlantic, but it\u2019s not anymore. The white supremacists have hijacked the Confederate flag and it has been seen as a symbol of hate, but it never intentionally was.\u201d\n\n\n\nBilly Roper of The Shield Wall Network, who also showed up in Memphis that day, has a different view. Roper is a self-proclaimed white nationalist who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as \u201cthe uncensored voice of violent neo-Nazism.\u201d Roper is known for his unabashed use of racist, anti-Semitic language and violent rhetoric, at times suggesting that genocide and eugenics should be considered as potential tools to create an all-white ethno-state within the borders of United States. \u201cEthnic cleansing is no new concept,\u201d he said during the Memphis protest. \u201cIt\u2019s always been human nature.\u201d\n\nThe way he saw it, the Shield Wall Network was here to nudge the Confederate activists in the right direction. \u201cMy job is to be as extreme as I can be legally,\u201d he said. \u201cMy radical flank works to make Confederate 901 more radical and extreme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point during the day, Billy Roper and a group of about a dozen supporters managed to post up just outside of Health Sciences Park, formerly known as Forrest Park. Once there, they unfurled a banner: \u201cDiversity = White Genocide.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 10 am on Saturday, it was clear that the City of Memphis had no intention of turning this protest into another Charlottesville. A quarter-mile perimeter was established around the park with various checkpoints that included metal detectors and an extensive police presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe violence some community members feared never materialized as counter-protesters from Take \u2018Em Down 901, the NAACP, and other city and civic leaders urged residents not to engage, instead calling for a day of community service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTami Sawyer, founder of Take \u2018Em Down 901 and political planning chair of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP, posted a message to Facebook on Friday evening: \u201cWhile some will choose to ride around and gather in the name of hatred and white supremacy, we are calling for all Memphis to \u2018show up!\u2019 But don\u2019t show up by protesting, counter protesters. Show up by taking this opportunity to show the world that we work together to serve our community.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday morning the hashtag #SHOWUPMEMPHIS began to circulate on social media. Sawyer said she drew inspiration from the efforts of Take \u2018Em Down NOLA in New Orleans where the city saw the removal of three confederate monuments in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been on the front lines for three or four years and saw no change,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cI was encouraged to think of a small change that might be able to happen in the short term and I immediately focused on the monuments.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 3 pm on Saturday, only a small pocket of anti-racist activists had come and gone. Neither the protesters nor the counter-protesters had the opportunity to lay eyes on one another. The Confederate 901 caravan never drove into the city, opting only to make a continuous loop around the I-240 for two hours before stopping at a rally point to disband outside of the city.\n\n\u201cWe did it and it was peaceful,\u201d said Billy Sessions as he sat back in his chair, exhausted and dazed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack at a smoky hotel room in Arkansas a few minutes outside Memphis, Sessions, along with members of \u201cpatriot\u201d organizations Hiwaymen, the Carolina Defenders, and the leadership of Confederate 901, shared stories over beer.\n\nBut the protesters couldn\u2019t completely relax. They\u2019d received a number of threats on social media during the day, they said. A Springfield XD handgun sat on the nightstand, a remnant of the tension earlier that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe night that the statues came down, I was angry,\u201d said George, a Confederate 901 organizer, who didn\u2019t want to give his last name. \u201cI\u2019m a real big history guy and a big fan of Nathan Bedford Forrest. I\u2019ve even been up there to clean the statue and I\u2019ve put flowers on his grave for the past four or five years. I have a great respect for him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know how inner-city Memphis is,\u201d added James Del Brock, co-founder of the Hiwaymen. \u201cI\u2019ve drove through a lot of it. I\u2019ve drove through it with my motorcycle and battle flag. I\u2019ve always wanted to know, because I\u2019m a white person, how to reach into the inner city without getting shot.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they sipped their beers, the protesters signed a Confederate flag. The founder of the Carolina Defenders, who offered his first name, Tom, made a point to note that the signatures were in commemoration, not desecration.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit back and watch it anymore,\u201d Tom said. \u201cThere\u2019s a point where every American has to stand up and say, \u2018Look, our kids aren\u2019t going to have a future or anything to look forward to if the constitution keeps getting trashed the way it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, though, the mood was hopeful. A man who would only identify himself as Phillip and the founder of Confederate 901 says the group is seeking 501c3 status. They recently received a $10,000 donation from a single donor. \u201cThe money is coming in,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nThis feature is part of Splinter\u2019s project to recruit local, embedded reporters, essayists, and photographers across the country.

Eighty percent of the poll was conducted after Trump\u2019s Tuesday comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFifty-two percent of respondents said so, as compared with just over a quarter (27 percent) who thought it was strong enough. . . .\u201d\n\nUnlike in past controversies, there was \u201cno rush to the microphones to defend Donald Trump,\u201d \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt told viewers.\n\nWatergate reporter Carl Bernstein said on Wednesday\u2019s \u201cAC360\" on CNN, \u201cI think there\u2019s considerable evidence that there is a consensus developing in the military; at the highest levels in the intelligence community; among Republicans in Congress; including the leaders in the business community\u201d that Trump \u201cis unfit to be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoland Martin, speaking on his \u201cNews One Now\u201d show on cable television\u2019s TVOne and simultaneously on \u201cThe Tom Joyner Morning Show,\u201d syndicated on radio, delivered perhaps the strongest call to action, at least for an African American with his own national broadcast platform.\n\n\u201cThis is a president who has no shame,\u201d Martin said. \u201c. . . He is an immoral leader. What this man has done by aligning himself with neo-Nazis and with white supremacists is shameful and should not go unchecked. But it\u2019s not just a question of going unchecked \u2014 we must do more than simply tweet and comment on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge \u2014 this is a declaration of war. . . . For 398 years, black folks have been fighting for this county to ensure that it lives up to its ideals \u2014 for 398 years we\u2019ve made it perfectly clear that we\u2019re not going to sit idly by and allow ourselves to be embarrassed and run over and shamed by white supremacists.\u201d Martin noted that Trump had not even called the family of Heather Heyer, who was run over by a car and killed during Saturday\u2019s protests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia commentary wasn\u2019t solely about the president. It touched on the kind of nation we were becoming, the \u201ceven-handedness\u201d of the coverage, and whether the news media had reflected the true state of race relations.\n\nThere were contradictions to raise and to cover, and interested parties to interview, such as World War II veterans and Jews concerned about white nationalists carrying the Nazi flag. There were business leaders, supporters and opponents of Confederate monuments, historians and Trump enthusiasts. In Atlanta, Mark Strassmann of CBS News interviewed Janelle Jones and Lucretia Hughes, two black women remaining loyal to Trump.\n\nUnivision showed a video of Chris Baker, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, insulting Univision anchor Ilia Calder\u00f3n, who is Afro-Colombian, with racial slurs. \u201cTo me you are a n**ger. That\u2019s it,\u201d Baker told Calder\u00f3n, Mar\u00eda Camila Monta\u00f1ez reported Tuesday for Latino Rebels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s statement that statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson might be the next to go, given the accelerated push to remove or relocate monuments to Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and other Confederates? Not all media reports answered that question, but those that did explained the false equivalence.\n\n\u201cThere is a crucial difference between leaders like Washington and Jefferson, imperfect men who helped create the United States, [historian Annette] Gordon-Reed said, and Confederate generals like Jackson and Lee, whose main historical significance is that they took up arms against it,\u201d Jennifer Schuessler reported Tuesday in the New York Times.\n\nOn Wednesday, Slate published an open letter from Jack Christian and Warren Christian, Jackson\u2019s great-great grandsons, to Richmond, Va., Mayor Levar Stoney and other officials. They asked \u201cfor the removal of his statue, as well as the removal of all Confederate statues from Monument Avenue. They are overt symbols of racism and white supremacy, and the time is long overdue for them to depart from public display. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were other questions: What does it say about the nation that the neo-Nazis are so young?\n\nWhy were four people arrested for their role in taking down a Confederate statue in Durham, N.C., while in Charlottesville, \u201cpolice have yet to arrest anyone for viciously beating Deandre Harris, a 20-year-old black man, even though photo and video footage of five white men assaulting Harris has been virally circulated on social media and televised news for several days,\u201d in the words of Jessica Corbett, writing Wednesday for Common Dreams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas Trump correct to put the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d and the newly named \u201calt-left\u201d on the same moral plane, a question reporters asked Trump on Tuesday?\n\nJournalists were gobsmacked that day, as Trump went \u201crogue\u201d and off-script, reversing his carefully prepared announcement naming white nationalists as culprits in the deaths and injuries Saturday.\n\nBrian Stelter described the scene Wednesday for CNN Money: \u201cReporters waited in the lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday for vague remarks from President Trump about infrastructure. White House aides tamped down expectations ahead of time: they said the president was not expected to take questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reporters and aides were both surprised by what came next.\n\n\u201cTrump said \u2018both sides\u2019 were responsible for the violence in Charlottesville that left three people dead on Saturday, seemingly equating neo-Nazis with anti-racism activists.\n\n\u201cAfter the Q&A session, members of the media freely expressed shock, disappointment and sometimes outright disgust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Wow,\u2019 CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper said immediately afterward. \u2018That was something else.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018What I just saw gave me the wrong kind of chills,\u2019 Chuck Todd said on MSNBC. \u2018Honestly I\u2019m a bit shaken by what I just heard, and I suspect it\u2019s not \u2018just me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn editorial in Wednesday\u2019s Washington Post was titled \u2018The nation can only weep.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMSNBC\u2019s Nicolle Wallace wondered if some of Trump\u2019s aides would resign.\n\n\u201cOthers wondered aloud about the president\u2019s fitness for office.\n\n\u201cSome hosts and commentators on Fox News were also sharply critical of the president. \u2018I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s actually real life what I just watched,\u2019 5 p.m. co-host Kat Timpf said. But the channel\u2019s prime time shows spent more time attacking liberals and the media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe closest analogue to Tuesday was Oct. 8. That\u2019s the day the obscene \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape came out via a story on the Post\u2019s web site. . . .\u201d\n\nCNN Refuses Anti-Media Trump Campaign Ad\n\n\u201cCNN has for the second time declined to air a Trump campaign advertisement because of anti-media content,\u201d Steven Perlberg reported Tuesday for BuzzFeed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe new ad, entitled \u2018Let President Trump Do His Job,\u2019 casts the press as the president\u2019s enemy and features clips of various mainstream media news anchors, including CNN personalities like Don Lemon, Dana Bash, Fareed Zakaria, Anderson Cooper, and John King,\u201d as well as April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection campaign committee said in a press release that it had attempted to buy placement for the ad on CNN, but that the network had blocked the ad buy. In May, CNN also did not air a Trump ad because it included a graphic that called the media \u2018fake news.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nWith Trump, Resist Making False Equivalency\n\n\u201cDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, the national news media\u2019s misguided sense of fairness helped equate the serious flaws of Hillary Clinton with the disqualifying evils of Donald Trump,\u201d Margaret Sullivan wrote Wednesday for the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018But her emails . . .\u2019 goes the ironic line that aptly summarizes too much of the media\u2019s coverage of the candidates. In short: Clinton\u2019s misuse of a private email server was inflated to keep up with Trump\u2019s racism, sexism and unbalanced narcissism \u2014 all in the name of seeming evenhanded. . . .\u201d\n\nSullivan also wrote, \u201cAt Tuesday\u2019s contentious Trump Tower news conference, the president disparaged reporters, sometimes calling them \u2014 as if saying their names \u2014 \u2018fake news,\u2019 \u201cEarlier that day, he circulated on Twitter a cartoon image of a CNN reporter being run down by the \u2018Trump Train.\u2019 Appalling, yes, but nothing new, just another page in Trump\u2019s blame-the-media playbook.\n\n\u201cIn response, reporters kept asking questions, bringing the president from his preferred topic of infrastructure to what was on everyone\u2019s mind: racism and violence. Their words were respectful, their tenor insistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt looked about right to me. And yes, it was certainly fair.\n\n\u201cCan journalism be both impartial and forceful? That\u2019s not only a possibility but, more than ever, a necessity.\n\n\u201cIn dealing with the false-equivalency president they helped to get elected, the news media may have learned something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe best way to be fair is not to be falsely evenhanded, giving equal weight to unequal sides. It\u2019s to push for the truth, and tell it both accurately and powerfully.\u201d\n\n\u2018This Virtually Is a Terrorist Movement\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a lot of similarities between the civil rights reporting of the \u201960s and early \u201970s and this alt-right movement that\u2019s going on now. I think this virtually is a terrorist movement,\u201d Richard A. Oppel (pictured left), editor of the Austin American-Statesman from 1995 to 2008, said Tuesday in Nieman Reports.\n\nOppel, Bill Kovach and Hank Klibanoff, white journalists who have written about or covered the civil rights movement, were asked what journalists can learn from coverage of that movement and the level of reporting that current events demand.\n\n\u201cIf I were going to compare it, I would compare it to coverage of Al Qaeda \u2014 how are they organized, how do they communicate, how are they financed, what are their political ties,\u201d Oppel continued. \u201cThere are similarities to the civil rights period certainly in terms of some of those things and to the question of race and ethnicity and so on but there\u2019s something different here; I really regard these more as terrorists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s similar [to reporters covering the civil rights movement] is that there\u2019s a risk of bodily harm in coverage of violent groups, but that\u2019s always been the case, whether it\u2019s been coverage of the civil rights movement or coverage of Iraq and Afghanistan or current violent political protests.

If black journalists mimic the same liberal views on politics and other issues as their white liberal counterparts, other than cosmetics, some would ask what difference does their presence make? . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaynard Jackson, a Republican operative whose column is distributed by the National Newspaper Publishers Association, made a similar point Tuesday.\u201dCheck out the list of speakers from last week\u2019s convention.

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Republican and Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus were invited but did not attend, according to Glover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its official response, NABJ said, \u201cAs a non-partisan organization, NABJ routinely and purposefully extends opportunities for engagement to newsmakers, people of interest, and organizations on both sides of the aisle. As journalists and media professionals we are charged with seeking and providing when possible, both sides of any story \u2014 regardless of the subject. This is what we strive to do at our annual convention and throughout the year with our other programming.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Vann R. Newkirk II, writing Friday in the Atlantic, weighed in on the well-publicized clash between moderator Ed Gordon and Newman, writing, \u201cThe NABJ is bound by nonpartisanship, and by the the journalistic expectation that personal political views are cast to the side when it comes to engaging with all political leaders on the issues.

For Casey, the Venezuelan crisis is also personal. He covered the country for 10 months before the Venezuelan government barred him from returning to Venezuela after a vacation. The government no longer allows the Times to have an office in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . I haven\u2019t been able to get back into my apartment,\u201d Casey said in a Q-and-A.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasey was asked what journalists have missed in their reporting on Venezuela and what advice he would give fellow foreign correspondents covering the crisis.\n\nHe replied, in part, \u201cPeople always see the collapse of Venezuela as having to do directly with socialism. I don\u2019t agree. I think there\u2019s a lot of different ways to run a country. One way you can\u2019t run your country is making it entirely dependent on oil. That has nothing to do with politics, but everything to do with why Venezuela is in the situation that it is now. When the price of oil is high, it\u2019s boom times. When oil prices start to slump, as it has now and will probably remain for some period of time, it becomes a starving time. That\u2019s an economic answer, not necessarily a political one.\n\n\u201cThe mistake, which I think is often missed, is the fact that Venezuela has done nothing to try to produce something that\u2019s not oil. This is largely the reason there\u2019s no money in Venezuela right now. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatin America More \u2018Comfortable\u2019 About Race (June 9, 2016)\n\nShort Takes\n\nClick here to view this abc7ny.com embed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLori Stokes says goodbye to viewers of WABC-TV\u2019s \u201cEyewitness News\u201d on Wednesday.

In the rearview mirror is President Barack Obama, whom African-American college students loved and voted for in historic numbers. At the same time, Obama was tone-deaf to the concerns of many HBCUs, and his policies gutted schools across the nation.\n\nObama\u2019s complicated HBCU legacy New Orleans \u2018Recovery\u2019 schools: a wound (almost) healed \u2014 Will North Carolina back down in Title IX \u2026 Read more Read\n\nIn front of them is President Donald Trump and a Republican Party that has created one of the most hostile administrations in American history, while at the same time inviting over 60 HBCU heads to Washington, D.C., for listening sessions and panel discussions and to attend the signing of a new HBCU executive order. The result was 48 hours of bad public relations for some HBCUs, a mixture of praise and skepticism about Trump\u2019s executive orders, and a future that looks as muddled as ever.\n\nMany presidents who came to Washington were attacked by their own students and alumni and political analysts for answering Trump\u2019s call. Howard University students went so far as to put signs around campus expressing displeasure with President Wayne A.I. Frederick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this anger is understandable, you have to consider the position of these presidents. HBCUs are heavily dependent on federal funds for support and to pay tuition for many students. The opportunity to meet with POTUS, even one as problematic as this one, is part of the job that any college president has.\n\nDuring a Q&A session with Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), William Bynum, president of Mississippi Valley State, expressed the conflict that many of the attendees of the White House and subsequent Capitol Hill meetings are facing:\n\n\u201cWe, as HBCU presidents, are being besieged with communications from students, faculty, staff and alumni that say, \u2018We are being used.\u2019 How do we answer this question?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Republicans had a wonderful opportunity to address that tension and ease these concerns, but failed to fully take advantage of the opportunity. The biggest problem facing Republicans who want to work with HBCUs is the same problem that Republicans as a whole face when attempting to court the African-American community: Republicans abjectly refuse to acknowledge the conflict between individual intention and institutional hostility.\n\nThere are plenty of Republicans, especially black ones, who are dedicated to helping HBCUs, but they fail to confront the reality that the Republican Party as a whole promotes policies that are directly hostile to African-American interests. When the secretary of education thinks that HBCUs are the first wave of school choice, and Kellyanne Conway treats a group of African-American college presidents like a visiting NBA championship team, black skepticism is pretty justified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Scott told President Bynum that as the only black Republican in the Senate, he knows what it\u2019s like to have the African-American community question him about working with Trump. He praised the presidents in the room for coming to Washington and encouraged them all to stay committed to their work and ignore the criticism.\n\nLater on, Scott elaborated on his thoughts, noting how unfair it was that African Americans are demanding that HBCU presidents confront the Trump administration in ways that didn\u2019t occur under Obama.\n\n\u201cWhy hold us to a different standard [than Obama was held to]?\u201d he said, citing the former president\u2019s many failures with HBCUs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI followed up by pointing out to the senator that an executive order by Trump doesn\u2019t have any funding attached to it. This administration\u2019s budgetary focus on the military and immigration doesn\u2019t carve out much space for making Pell Grants year-round or fully funding Title III grants that are supposed to specifically help HBCUs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a foolish question,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWhy should I have to provide a number? [Obama] didn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have numbers yet. But this is just step 1. The budget will come and we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m not working for Republicans, I\u2019m not working for black people; I\u2019m here to work for the Lord and try to give everyone access to education, and people should understand that.\u201d\n\nRep. Walker and Speaker Ryan both offered comments and anecdotes about HBCUs that ranged from sincerely naive and clueless to somewhat insulting. In an exchange about the ways that HBCU graduates make an impact across the nation, Ryan immediately jumped to Donald Driver, a Super Bowl-winning former wide receiver from the Green Bay Packers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDonald Driver went to Alcorn State. Is Alcorn here? That\u2019s an HBCU, right?\u201d said Ryan, attempting to make a little joke.\n\nNo one in the room laughed.\n\nWalker, a white Republican from North Carolina, talked about how his wife earned a nursing degree at North Carolina A&T, which inspired him to be a champion of HBCUs despite pushback he gets from some constituents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI hear things from constituents,\u201d he said during the end-of-day panel. \u201cSomebody told me, \u2018We didn\u2019t send you to Congress to go and get money for HBCUs,\u2019 and I pushed back on that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s worth noting is that while Walker can position himself as a noble white person standing as a bulwark against the bigotry, he leaves out the rest of the story. The fact that he has constituents who are comfortable enough and bold enough to say, \u201cStop doing your job for a university in your district and employer of thousands of people because they are black,\u201d is an example of exactly the kind of bigotry that makes HBCUs necessary. This is also exactly the kind of bigotry that Trump and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will do nothing to stop.\n\nThe final executive order that Trump signed Tuesday will not substantively change the fate of HBCUs, and the Republican Party is not unified enough to provide any sort of clear path forward for colleges to follow, either. Nevertheless, you can\u2019t fault HBCU presidents for doing their jobs and trying to find whatever avenues they can to improve their institutions. It\u2019s not their fault that the Trump administration is riddled with policymakers who are hostile to the existence of African-American institutions. There could be a dozen HBCU meetings at the White House every year, but no amount of kind words from a few well-meaning members of Congress will change that fact.", "keywords": ["republicans", "hbcus", "presidents", "yard", "africanamerican", "republican", "nice", "try", "stomp", "dont", "trump", "hbcu", "black", "students", "president"], "polarity": 0.07568738156087552, "subjectivity": 0.43875936647020986},

In the episode \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d which employs the same format as Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d episode, the anthology within an anthology gives us brief tours into the horrors of technological advancements, culminating with one larger story arc\u2014that of Clayton, a black man whose virtual conscience is ceaselessly tortured in a vile, sadistic museum attraction.\n\n\n\nThe man to blame for this repulsive amusement park is the museum\u2019s proprietor, Rolo Haynes, who approaches Clayton Leigh while he is on death row for an alleged murder. Instead of looking into DNA evidence to clear Clayton\u2019s name as he is asked to do, Rolo instead convinces Clayton to sign over the rights to his post-death consciousness. When Clayton\u2019s pardon falls through due, in part, to negligence on Rolo\u2019s end, Clayton is given the electric chair. However, his signed agreement allows Rolo to reincarnate Clayton as a fully conscious hologram, and unbeknownst to Clayton or his family, Rolo has insidious intentions\u2014to imprison Clayton\u2019s reborn self in a museum exhibit.\n\nYou see, Clayton 2.0 isn\u2019t your typical hologram but instead a living, breathing electronic copy of Clayton that is conscious and can feel pain. Rolo uses this as a vehicle for profit, allowing museum visitors to electrically shock Clayton as a form of amusement, while Clayton bears the full and very real agony of electrocution. This morbid attraction, bundled with its equally morbid souvenir, a key chain that replays Clayton\u2019s tortured shrieks, is described by the museum\u2019s curator as a \u201cconscious sentient snapshot of Clayton ... perpetually experiencing that beautiful pain. Stuck forever in that one perfect moment of agony. Always on. Always suffering.\u201d\n\nThis quote and depiction, in many ways, illustrates America\u2019s historical obsession with black pain and its commodification for profit.\n\nSlavery is the glaring beginning of this horrific legacy as it forcibly turned black people into things that could be purchased, exploited for labor, brutalized and raped. Yet history does not stop there. Human zoos, which put black and brown bodies on display for zoo patrons to laugh and jeer at, were prominent throughout the 1800s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, lynching postcards were extremely popular items in the United States. These postcards displayed the gruesome murders of thousands of black people who were lynched over the course of a century and were bought, sold and sent as greetings between white families and friends.\n\nIn minstrelsy, white men donned blackface to spout false and harmful portrayals of black men and women.\n\nAll of these atrocities were businesses that turned black pain into capitalistic gain. But what happens when the commodity is a byproduct of pain? That is, to obtain the end product, pain must be inflicted. For the museum visitors to obtain their key chain trinket of Clayton, they must electrocute him. Similarly, goods such as the aforementioned lynching postcards and human zoos existed because they were able to collect a \u201cconscious sentient snapshot\u201d of black pain. Always on. Always suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday these \u201csnapshots\u201d take the form of enterprises like the rap industry, in which artists recount trauma, suicidal thoughts and drug addiction while listeners sing along, or museums where people line up to pay to get a glimpse at the bloody slab of concrete where Martin Luther King Jr. took his last breath, or hashtag T-shirt companies whose sales literally depend on continued fatal encounters between black individuals and police officers. As James Allen expressed, \u201cIn America, everything is for sale, even national shame.\u201d\n\n\n\nChance the Rapper often speaks of the summer being a time of death in his community, because many are murdered during the hot months in Chicago. Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s \u201cXO Tour Llif3,\u201d Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cu,\u201d Geto Boy\u2019s \u201cMind Playing Tricks on Me,\u201d Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cSuicidal Thoughts,\u201d Nas\u2019 \u201cDrunk by Myself,\u201d 2Pac\u2019s \u201cThug Mansion\u201d and Vic Mensa\u2019s \u201cThere\u2019s a Lot Going On\u201d all detail their deadly depression, thoughts of death by suicide and even suicide attempts. Hip-hop\u2019s lyricized accounts of poverty, addiction, violence and mental illness are purchased\u2014only to be blared through the speakers of middle-class white teenagers\u2019 cars.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack narratives aren\u2019t immune to hijacking, either. In film and television, our stories are told by white directors and producers for their glory and benefit\u2014as exemplified by the whiteness of the Oscars, Golden Globes and Emmys.\n\nThe media, in its \u201cheroic\u201d endeavors to report, builds its news reels, entertainment pieces and empire on the constant broadcasting of black pain for clicks and views.\n\nHell, our movements aren\u2019t even safe. Depictions of activism are used for commercials to sell Pepsi, a company whose CEO served on Donald Trump\u2019s Business Council, and social-action movements are co-opted by companies like Google and Microsoft, who made large contributions to Trump\u2019s campaign. These gestures are performative and utilized to maintain sales, influence and power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis continued packaging and sale of black struggle is dangerous for it numbs the consumer to black pain, since they are not affected by it but are merely enjoyers of its fruits.\n\nThis numbing bolsters the normalization of black suffering, which, in turn, perpetuates a fallacy that black individuals have an inherent high pain tolerance\u2014and therefore are a) undeserving of empathy and b) immune to the atrocities inflicted upon them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the same ridiculous notion that leads white physicians to withhold pain medication from black individuals under the falsehood that black people experience less pain than white people.\n\nIn other cases, it can create the artifice that black people are superhuman, which is evident in Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201csuperpredator\u201d comment as well as police officers\u2019 perceived need to use extreme force against unarmed black men out of a supposed fear for their lives. Then-Police Officer Darren Wilson displayed this type of thinking in his recount of the death of Mike Brown, whom he described as seemingly impervious to bullets.\n\nA worse scenario of the normalization of black pain manifests the normalization of black death, which is why videos of vicious killings like those of Sam Dubose and Philando Castile can go viral, being liked, shared and streamed millions of times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the cycle of the commodification of black pain, we become desensitized to black suffering in every form, even death.\n\n\n\n\u201cBlack Museum\u201d highlights some very important things about this disgusting cycle: the participants.\n\nIn \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d like in the real world, it is easy to blame the person who created the museum, but he or she is only half of the equation. It was Rolo who imprisoned Clayton, but it was the museum visitors who electrocuted him. It was the seemingly normal white tourists, families and children who pulled that lever, sending electric volts into Clayton\u2019s body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like it was the seemingly normal white families and children who turned lynchings into entertainment events, visited human zoos to gawk at Africans, and went to see minstrel shows.\n\nIt is easy to blame neo-Nazis, white supremacists and Trump for this roller coaster of an administration they\u2019ve built, but if many white folks, even the most benevolent, well-meaning white liberals, look in the mirror, they\u2019ll find that it is they who are holding the money to pay to get on the ride. And just like in the conclusion of Black Mirror: \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d they\u2019ll find that when one gets too comfortable participating in the act of black torture\u2014it rarely ends well.\n\n", "keywords": ["museum", "americas", "claytons", "zoos", "commodifying", "death", "reckons", "white", "mirror", "black", "rolo", "clayton", "history", "pain", "conscious"], "polarity": -0.010777253049980319, "subjectivity": 0.4535832349468708},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["conservative", "cpac", "sure", "conservatives", "list", "political", "im", "trumps", "video", "trump", "white", "convention", "introduce", "used", "black", "nigger", "watch", "pretty", "republican"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they\u2019ll be right back up there,\u201dthe Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cAnd you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nCarson is a retired neurosurgeon who ran for president in 2016, and before entering into politics, he was a motivational speaker. He regularly discussed the fact that he grew up in poverty, and Lifetime found his life story so compelling, the network turned it into the TV movie Gifted Hands, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. While the biopic set him up to be an inspiration to poor kids everywhere, his conservative politics, constant denunciations of government assistance and the way his foot is always in his mouth have made most people give him an extreme side eye.\n\nCarson\u2019s comments were made during a town hall recorded Tuesday to air in full Wednesday night, and clips of the interview were released to news organizations to promote the show, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson said \u201cthe wrong mindset\u201d is the product of negative parenting habits and exposure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a poverty spirit. You develop a certain mindset,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Carson said he believes the government can help people looking to climb out of poverty, he warned against programs that are \u201csustaining them in a position of poverty. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the majority of people don\u2019t have that defeatist attitude, but they sometimes just don\u2019t see the way, and that\u2019s where government can come in and be very helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can provide the ladder of opportunity, it can provide the mechanism that will demonstrate to them what can be done.\u201d\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget blueprint, unveiled Tuesday, would cut more than $6 billion from HUD\u2019s budget. The cuts would end popular grants that facilitate first-time home ownership and revitalize economically distressed communities, including the Community Development Block Grant. The budget would also cut billions of dollars in funding for public housing support, gutting dollars used to fund big-ticket repairs at public housing developments around the country. Carson has spoken at length in the past about personal responsibility and its intersection with poverty, bemoaning systemic dependence on public assistance. On the campaign trail, Carson repeatedly pushed back against accusations that he wanted to end social safety net programs; he stressed, instead, that he believed government assistance was not always given to people who truly needed it. \u201cI have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people,\u201d he said in the 2015 speech announcing his candidacy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not doing people a favor when we pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, you poor little thing, we\u2019re going to take care of all your needs. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u2019 You know who else says stuff like that? Socialists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment, but Williams did, and in an interview with the Post Wednesday evening, he defended Carson and said his views are based not on politics but on what is just.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of faith, not a man of politics,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDr. Carson believes in what is righteous, what is good, what is fair and what is just.\u201c\n\nSo remember, kids, poverty is just a state of mind. When Sallie Mae/Navient calls you to collect on those student loans next month, tell them that you don\u2019t owe them, and your monthly payment being late is just a state of mind. Remind them that if they keep this mindset, it\u2019s going to feel as if everyone owes them money when they really don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["mind", "parents", "passed", "carson", "politics", "thinks", "post", "mindset", "children", "dont", "poverty", "ben", "state", "williams", "way"], "polarity": 0.09328165374677003, "subjectivity": 0.4390166680864355},

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) seems to prefer that you not refer to him as a \u201chouse Negro.\u201d Or as an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d Likewise, Scott does not care for the insinuation that his conservative leanings equate to a complete condemnation of his own community. The lone black Republican member of the U.S. Senate conveyed such sentiments while delivering a 30-minute speech in defense of his support of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III for U.S. attorney general.\n\n\n\nAs Scott stood on the Senate floor, he read various forms of criticism that had been leveled at him across social media: \u201c\u2018You are an Uncle Tom, Scott. You\u2019re for Sessions. How does a black man turn on his own.\u2019\u201d And: \u201c\u2018Tim Scott ... doesn\u2019t have a shred of honor. He\u2019s a house Negro like the one in Django.\u2019\u201d\n\nScott went on to add, \u201cI left out all the ones that used the n-word. Just felt like that would not be appropriate.\u201d\n\nActually, he should have said it because that\u2019s what his party has been calling his people for the last 50 years in one form or another as part of its Southern strategy. As a son of South Carolina, Scott ought to be quite familiar with the ways that many white men like Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III have employed such tactics in terms of both policy and rhetoric.\n\nStill, some Republicans and even Democrats found themselves impressed with Scott\u2019s performance; others know better. Is the name-calling helpful? Probably not. Is it wrong to generalize all black Republicans? It\u2019s typically foolish to generalize, no matter the target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven so, it is not wrong to ask Scott why he would give a man who has been accused of bigotry for a substantial portion of his life control of the Justice Department.\n\nThe most frustrating portion of Scott\u2019s remarks, though, was the following: \u201cI just wish that my friends who call themselves liberals would want tolerance for all Americans, including conservative Americans.\u201d\n\nSen. Scott, you\u2019ve got to shut your black ass up. This is why black Republicans bewilder me. In theory, one can understand those who align with a political ideology that believes in smaller government and free enterprise on principle. As a contractor, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge that every single tax season, I morph into Ted Cruz with melanin and a spine and toy with the notion of abolishing the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet although the Democratic Party has plenty of issues with racism within its own ranks in terms of both policy and not valuing enough the black voters whose support has thwarted its extinction, there are certain levels to which the donkeys would never stoop.\n\nDemocrats of today would not nominate a cantaloupe-colored bigoted charlatan with no experience in government as president. Nor would they go along with that same con man\u2019s plans to nominate as attorney general in 2017 a man who was deemed too racist in the 1980s to be a federal judge.\n\nSure, Democrats can\u2019t, given that their base is far more inclusive, but the GOP doesn\u2019t have to be committed to the preservation of white, heterosexual male power. Republicans want that as their nucleus, and anyone who aligns him- or herself with that is a co-conspirator. Such is his or her right, though it is not an act of principle but of self-interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim Scott wants to present nobility for the immoral act of lending support to a kakistocracy populated by a bevy of bigots.\n\nTo let Scott tell it, though: \u201cHe is not a racist. Jeff Sessions has earned my support. And I will hold him accountable if and when we disagree.\u201d\n\nThis is the same person who said, \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he could support Sunkist Stalin when he was still a candidate after Scott\u2019s initial pick, \u201cLittle Marco,\u201d dropped out. A black man who, yes, has discussed his own experiences with racism in law enforcement, yet has still defended \u201claw and order\u201d on national television. One who, after characterizing some of Sunkist Stalin\u2019s statements as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cindefensible\u201d and \u201cracially toxic,\u201d not only said that he would vote for him, but after his win, also argued that we should all give him a chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who bends that low to assist anyone that vile will not suddenly rise to speak on what\u2019s right. To wit, days before defending Sessions, he spoke on behalf of Betsy DeVos. No, she cannot single-handedly destroy public education, as he noted in a series of tweets, but she can do plenty of damage all the same. DeVos has aggressively proved herself unqualified for the job, but she gave Scott money in the past. Problem solved.\n\nAlready, Sessions is speaking of massive waves of crime and continuing on with the anti-immigrant rhetoric that he\u2019s long been known for. These are not dog whistles; they are screams of intent.\n\nSessions will weaponize the Justice Department and make it harder for blacks and Latinos to safely walk the streets without fear of police persecution; he will make it harder for black people to vote; he will bring hell to all immigrants regardless of hue. He will be the menace he was selected to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott can profess to know Sessions\u2019 heart. He can pretend that whatever meetings he scheduled between Sessions and black church leaders matter all he likes. The reality remains: He sold out his people and, by extension, all marginalized people.\n\nPerhaps Tim Scott doesn\u2019t like the names he\u2019s been called as a result of his choices, but nasty names have nothing on the harsh consequences that await so many of the rest of us.

The president of the United States sympathizes with and will provide aid and comfort to white supremacists, and he\u2019s put together an administration to help those groups achieve goals they can\u2019t accomplish through democratic means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only questions now are how do you live in a terrorist state, how do you resist a terrorist state and, most importantly, can you win? There is a little hope, but it takes a lot of historical digging to find the right plan moving forward.\n\n\n\nAnyone who is shocked or crying on cable networks after Trump\u2019s Charlottesville press conference has either been blind to his entire administration or feels guilty about his or her complicity in normalizing it.\n\nTrump hired Steve Bannon, from the \u201calt-right\u201d and white nationalist website Breitbart; he made Jeff Sessions attorney general; he hired Stephen Miller for his communications team; he hired Sebastian Gorka and Michael Anton\u2014and that is a fairly substantial list of men with strong ties to white nationalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you consider that dozens of positions like ambassadorships and crucial political offices that have still not been staffed by this administration, it really stands out that Trump has made such a concerted effort to get white nationalists set and ensconced in his administration. NFL owners keep drafting and signing players with domestic violence rap sheets, and the public has come to accept that these owners either are actual abusers themselves or have no problems with the abuse of women by their employees.\n\nTrump\u2019s staff selections are no different. Who one hires is a reflection of one\u2019s values, and he\u2019s hired a bunch of white nationalists.\n\nUnderstanding what white supremacy means and how it relates to Trump\u2019s terror advocacy is essential to the survival of the United States and of African Americans in particular. There are \u201clevels to this,\u201d and understanding what level of racial danger he has empowered is important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite supremacy is the American baseline; it\u2019s the idea that white people are just inherently better than everybody else at just about everything. This country was founded on that idea, and there are white supremacists everywhere, with most not even realizing that they are. The social-justice-warrior \u201cally\u201d who keeps tone-policing black people on Twitter; the co-worker who keeps saying that what happened to Trayvon Martin is a \u201ctragedy\u201d but who can\u2019t quite humanize him\u2014that\u2019s white supremacy.\n\nThe next level up is bigotry. These people are white supremacists who actually dislike black people. Bigots join the Ku Klux Klan, kill black people and redline black neighborhoods.\n\nWhite nationalists are the ultimate evolution of white supremacy and bigotry; they are the Hulk to white supremacy\u2019s Bruce Banner, only whiter and more violent. White nationalists believe that America should be a white, Christian ethno-state; and their goal is to remove all non-Christian, nonwhite people from the country in any way they can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is virtually impossible to achieve this goal through democratic means, so white nationalists advocate violence and policies that will marginalize and limit the power and numbers of nonwhite people in America.\n\nSo when Trump says that some of the people in Charlottesville\u2019s Unite the Right march were \u201cgood people,\u201d he\u2019s saying that he thinks terrorism is OK. When he refers to the death of Heather Heyer and the beating of Deandre Harris and dozens of others as \u201ccriminal acts\u201d instead of terrorism, he\u2019s saying that white nationalists broke the law, but they did not threaten his conception of the state.\n\nWhen Jeff Sessions initiates policies to suppress minority voting, he\u2019s pushing white nationalist policies. When Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon develop a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and new immigration policy to limit immigrants from nonwhite countries, they\u2019re working on the white nationalist goal of the white ethno-state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are all terrorist sympathizers, and they know it, and are blatant about it. Question is: What do you do about it?\n\nFirst, recognize that as a person of color, you\u2019re on your own until this man is out of office. That means that protecting ourselves financially, educationally, politically and even physically becomes essential.\n\nThe last time African Americans faced a president who openly sympathized with a terror state was almost 100 years ago with Woodrow Wilson. Wilson\u2019s two terms in office, from 1914 to 1921, were filled with internecine violence against black people by police, aided and abetted by white vigilantes and condoned by a president who threw civil rights leaders out of the White House and reversed existing anti-discrimination policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people responded to Wilson by focusing our money and resources on our own community, supporting black newspapers to provide real information about the community, starting black organizations and supporting black art. We did not retreat to our enclaves, but emboldened and infused them with our money and time. Madam C.J. Walker\u2019s best business years were during the Wilson administration; A. Philip Randolph started The Messenger, a black socialist newspaper; Carter G. Woodson founded the first black think tank.\n\nThese weren\u2019t \u201cfeel good\u201d activities; they were counterterrorism strategies, placing the financial, educational and political power of black people back into our own hands, making alliances where needed, while primarily depending on our own resources.\n\nIn modern times, that means supporting black newspapers and sites, supporting and funding anti-white nationalist fighters and organizations; and yes, it means public actions like getting gun licenses, applying for jobs as police officers, serving on juries, and, believe it or not, even tweeting the hell out of terror-supporting political leaders and policymakers so they don\u2019t get to operate in darkness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory tells us that the Trump terrorism presidency will not be short, it will not be kind and it will not end easily. His allies in the white nationalist movement, emboldened by his tacit consent, will continue to attack and kill all across the nation, with deaths moving from speeding cars to Oklahoma City-level violence.\n\nThe best hope of the black community is to rely upon the strategies and resources of the past to survive and get out of this alive on the other side.\n\nWhich, if we\u2019re lucky, will only take about eight years.", "keywords": ["administration", "terrorist", "nationalist", "states", "hes", "means", "trump", "sympathizer", "white", "nationalists", "violence", "black", "united", "president"], "polarity": 0.06678658008658009, "subjectivity": 0.36941731601731587},

Not President Donald Trump though, he\u2019s out stunting, bashing the armed school security officer for not running into the school to save the kids, and of course, making everything about himself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know until you test it, but I think, I really believe I\u2019d run in there, even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too,\u201d Trump told a gathering of U.S. governors at the White House.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for a test; you don\u2019t even have to pull out a pen and paper, Trump would fail, miserably. This is a president who is afraid of germs, afraid of bald eagles, afraid of being booed, afraid of being poisoned, and he used bone spurs as an excuse to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere is nothing that Donald Trump has ever done that would give anybody the impression he would risk his own life to run into a hail of bullets to protect a bunch of kids, maybe not even his own.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever fear though, there are some decent presidents out there, and I can think of about 10 presidents off the top of my head that would be more likely to, and who I\u2019d rather have, risk life and limb to save a bunch of kids from a mass shooting than Trump.\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe President in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. President Andrew Jackson\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nAndrew Jackson, our seventh president, 20 Dollar Jack, survived 13 duels, lived with a bullet in his leg for 19 years and was known to beat folks down with a hickory stick just for fun. He was an unrepentant racist, and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president. So he\u2019d definitely run into a school to save a bunch of kids for the glory, but only the white ones because racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The President From Rick and Morty\n\nThe president in Rick and Morty is a badass, he has an arsenal of weapons, he\u2019s vengeful, and he fought the smartest man in the universe over a selfie. If he weren\u2019t black, I\u2019m pretty sure Trump would nominate him to run into a hail of bullets and save a bunch of kids in his place. And he\u2019s voiced by Keith David. Who isn\u2019t comforted by the sound of Keith David\u2019s voice in times of danger?\n\n5. Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: Showtime\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4. Bill Clinton\n\nYes, Bill Clinton is a draft-dodger just like Trump, and nothing about him strikes me as being particularly altruistic. But, if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. President James Marshall\n\nThis was close, it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24 but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. President Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, then at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust in the school, save the kids, take out the shooter, and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background. Mind you, if he screwed up or got lost on the way to save the kids, the Buffalo Soldiers would show up and actually get the job done; showing once again how black Americans are always there to clean up America\u2019s problems.\n\n", "keywords": ["school", "presidents", "save", "afraid", "hes", "bunch", "trump", "likely", "run", "shooter", "kids", "president"], "polarity": 0.0983643353174603, "subjectivity": 0.4928311011904762},

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) seems to prefer that you not refer to him as a \u201chouse Negro.\u201d Or as an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d Likewise, Scott does not care for the insinuation that his conservative leanings equate to a complete condemnation of his own community. The lone black Republican member of the U.S. Senate conveyed such sentiments while delivering a 30-minute speech in defense of his support of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III for U.S. attorney general.\n\n\n\nAs Scott stood on the Senate floor, he read various forms of criticism that had been leveled at him across social media: \u201c\u2018You are an Uncle Tom, Scott. You\u2019re for Sessions. How does a black man turn on his own.\u2019\u201d And: \u201c\u2018Tim Scott ... doesn\u2019t have a shred of honor. He\u2019s a house Negro like the one in Django.\u2019\u201d\n\nScott went on to add, \u201cI left out all the ones that used the n-word. Just felt like that would not be appropriate.\u201d\n\nActually, he should have said it because that\u2019s what his party has been calling his people for the last 50 years in one form or another as part of its Southern strategy. As a son of South Carolina, Scott ought to be quite familiar with the ways that many white men like Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III have employed such tactics in terms of both policy and rhetoric.\n\nStill, some Republicans and even Democrats found themselves impressed with Scott\u2019s performance; others know better. Is the name-calling helpful? Probably not. Is it wrong to generalize all black Republicans? It\u2019s typically foolish to generalize, no matter the target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven so, it is not wrong to ask Scott why he would give a man who has been accused of bigotry for a substantial portion of his life control of the Justice Department.\n\nThe most frustrating portion of Scott\u2019s remarks, though, was the following: \u201cI just wish that my friends who call themselves liberals would want tolerance for all Americans, including conservative Americans.\u201d\n\nSen. Scott, you\u2019ve got to shut your black ass up. This is why black Republicans bewilder me. In theory, one can understand those who align with a political ideology that believes in smaller government and free enterprise on principle. As a contractor, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge that every single tax season, I morph into Ted Cruz with melanin and a spine and toy with the notion of abolishing the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet although the Democratic Party has plenty of issues with racism within its own ranks in terms of both policy and not valuing enough the black voters whose support has thwarted its extinction, there are certain levels to which the donkeys would never stoop.\n\nDemocrats of today would not nominate a cantaloupe-colored bigoted charlatan with no experience in government as president. Nor would they go along with that same con man\u2019s plans to nominate as attorney general in 2017 a man who was deemed too racist in the 1980s to be a federal judge.\n\nSure, Democrats can\u2019t, given that their base is far more inclusive, but the GOP doesn\u2019t have to be committed to the preservation of white, heterosexual male power. Republicans want that as their nucleus, and anyone who aligns him- or herself with that is a co-conspirator. Such is his or her right, though it is not an act of principle but of self-interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim Scott wants to present nobility for the immoral act of lending support to a kakistocracy populated by a bevy of bigots.\n\nTo let Scott tell it, though: \u201cHe is not a racist. Jeff Sessions has earned my support. And I will hold him accountable if and when we disagree.\u201d\n\nThis is the same person who said, \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he could support Sunkist Stalin when he was still a candidate after Scott\u2019s initial pick, \u201cLittle Marco,\u201d dropped out. A black man who, yes, has discussed his own experiences with racism in law enforcement, yet has still defended \u201claw and order\u201d on national television. One who, after characterizing some of Sunkist Stalin\u2019s statements as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cindefensible\u201d and \u201cracially toxic,\u201d not only said that he would vote for him, but after his win, also argued that we should all give him a chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who bends that low to assist anyone that vile will not suddenly rise to speak on what\u2019s right. To wit, days before defending Sessions, he spoke on behalf of Betsy DeVos. No, she cannot single-handedly destroy public education, as he noted in a series of tweets, but she can do plenty of damage all the same. DeVos has aggressively proved herself unqualified for the job, but she gave Scott money in the past. Problem solved.\n\nAlready, Sessions is speaking of massive waves of crime and continuing on with the anti-immigrant rhetoric that he\u2019s long been known for. These are not dog whistles; they are screams of intent.\n\nSessions will weaponize the Justice Department and make it harder for blacks and Latinos to safely walk the streets without fear of police persecution; he will make it harder for black people to vote; he will bring hell to all immigrants regardless of hue. He will be the menace he was selected to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott can profess to know Sessions\u2019 heart. He can pretend that whatever meetings he scheduled between Sessions and black church leaders matter all he likes. The reality remains: He sold out his people and, by extension, all marginalized people.\n\nPerhaps Tim Scott doesn\u2019t like the names he\u2019s been called as a result of his choices, but nasty names have nothing on the harsh consequences that await so many of the rest of us.

Donald Trump was not the most popular candidate for president in 2016. Donald Trump is so unpopular that he can\u2019t convince a Bruce Springsteen cover band to perform at his inauguration. These are facts.\n\nHowever, none of that prevented literally dozens of Americans of color from coming to Washington, D.C., to celebrate his inauguration Friday. On Wednesday I attended the Black Tie & Chic Gala, a salute to black Republican leaders appointed to serve the Trump transition and various positions in the new administration. The night was a microcosm of the black community heading into the Trump presidency. Some people are well-meaning, some people are misguided ideologues, and occasionally, people are downright dangerous to the health and safety of the black community.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the irony of a black Republican Trump event being held at the Watergate Hotel. During the 1972 presidential election, Republican Richard Nixon had a two-pronged strategy to win re-election to the White House: employing the Southern strategy, which entailed riling up white racism against black gains during the civil rights movement, and authorizing a break-in and theft of important documents from the Democratic Party, which was, at that time, housed in the Watergate Hotel.\n\nNow, 45 years later, you have black people celebrating the presidency of Trump, who employed a two-pronged campaign strategy of exacerbating white resentment against black people and a black president, and who asked the Russians to steal and then leak sensitive information from the Democratic National Committee. To be fair, Nixon got 15 percent of the black vote and got impeached for conspiring to undermine democracy, while Trump got only 8 percent of the black vote and faces no political consequences for being an asset to Russia\u2019s intelligence apparatus.\n\nThe event was held in the spacious ballroom of the Watergate; as you walked to the ballroom, there was a wall full of the names of black Republican trailblazers and a few members of the Trump transition team. The band played basic mainstream R&B hits while guests dined on chicken-and-waffles hors d\u2019oeuvres, burger sliders and lots of alcohol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all the low-key pomp and circumstance, you know what was decidedly absent? Donald Trump. Literally, Trump had little or no presence at an event that was supposed to be about celebrating African Americans who were going to work for him. It was almost like one of those \u201cnetwork marketing\u201d events where they don\u2019t want to tell you up front that they\u2019re trying to sell time-share vacations, but the staff is working the room telling everyone how nice St. Vincent\u2019s is this time of year. Except no one is fooled, and everybody already knows that St. Vincent\u2019s is overrated.\n\nWhen Armstrong Williams took the microphone, he barely mentioned the name Donald Trump. There were no cheers of \u201cWe won!\u201d There were no Trump-Pence signs, no Trump posters. I did not see one \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat or T-shirt. In fact, if you didn\u2019t read the gala program placed on the ballroom tables, you could have mistaken this night for a million other suit-and-tie events that happen every 15 minutes in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe room was filled with luminaries of the Trump campaign\u2014Ashley Bell, Elroy Sailor, Telly Lovelace, Pastor Mark Burns. Dr. Ben Carson made a guest appearance, in addition to GOP trailblazers like Michael Steele and J.C. Watts, who were honorary chairs of the event. What was striking, however, was that the optimism of those in the room seemed to be the inverse of their proximity to Trump and the White House. Those who were state-level volunteers or just Trump voters were enthusiastic about the incoming administration. Those who seemed closer to power were much more cautious, guarded and, in some cases, almost ambivalent toward our future under Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking to black potential staffers and campaign members about Trump was like getting the \u201cradio clean\u201d version of a Rick Ross album. Every other word is cut, edited, redacted or off the record. Nobody wants to talk, and whether that is out of fear, deference or a fleeting desire to snag a job, the result is the same. Which is not surprising. With a mere 24 hours to go before Trump takes office, very few black people\u2014outside of Carson\u2014have been given jobs in the new administration. Conventional wisdom says that if you haven\u2019t been picked up yet, you\u2019re probably on the sidelines.\n\nOf course, none of that mattered to the regular folks who were in attendance to celebrate their new president. I spoke to a 50-something-year-old couple from metro Atlanta (let\u2019s call them Gayle and Mark) who epitomized the mood at the event. Gayle had voted for Obama twice and claimed that she was a lifelong Democrat. In fact, she actually voted for Trump and then voted Democrat for every other office down her ballot. When I asked why, she said:\n\nThis is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I mean, Trump\u2019s a billionaire; I believe in him. Because he\u2019s rich already, he won\u2019t be influenced by lobbyists and all the money in Washington. He\u2019s just there because he cares about us. Hillary or anybody poor would be trying to get rich [in the White House]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen have you ever heard of a rich person who doesn\u2019t want more money?\u201d I said. To which Gayle gave me a textbook Kanye shrug. When I pointed out that Trump had been making deals to get richer since winning the election and had an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest in which his businesses stood to gain from his being president, she had no answer.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked her husband what he thought about Trump and his recent attacks on the city of Atlanta, he turned into Marshawn Lynch: \u201cI\u2019m just here ... I\u2019m kind of a \u2018go along to get along\u2019 kind of guy. She\u2019s the Trump supporter.\u201d\n\nThis was a common sentiment among black Trump supporters in the room who weren\u2019t really close to the campaign. They believed that Trump was not like other politicians; that, as one man from North Carolina told me, \u201cI\u2019d rather see him try and fail than Hillary, which was politics as usual.\u201d When I pointed out that a Trump \u201cfailure\u201d could result in millions losing health insurance, trade wars with China, military conflicts with Iran and a rollback of a half-century of civil rights legislation, I usually got a blank stare or some semblance of \u201cWell, if he doesn\u2019t deliver, we can kick him out in four years.\u201d Which might make sense if the voting rights of the majority remain intact. Oh, wait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I traversed the room talking to everyone from local GOP party members and volunteers to former \u201cNever Trump\u201d people, instead of a raucous celebration of victory and making America great again, I encountered a hodgepodge of idealistic, low-information voters mixed with party officials crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.\n\nThere were constant whispered stories of infighting among black Republicans, with certain names popping up repeatedly: redacted redacted Omarosa, redacted redacted and Pastor Daryl Scott; rationalizations about incoming Attorney General and longtime civil rights antagonist Jeff Sessions: \u201cWe might be able to work with Jeff Sessions ... on some things\u201d; and outright candid despair about former Breitbart white-nationalist-terror sympathizer Steve Bannon as Trump\u2019s senior adviser. \u201cSteve Bannon ... I don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s not ... I don\u2019t like that guy. I\u2019ve met him and he\u2019s not good,\u201d said one attendee, while another whispered, \u201cAt least he [Bannon] doesn\u2019t have much of an apparatus around him; not like Sessions.\u201d\n\nWe were promised food, dancing and music until 11:30, but the place was almost cleared out by a quarter after 10. People were leaving, the food was gone and the band was playing Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cStir It Up\u201d to a lone white couple in the middle of the room. It was almost as if no one wanted to pretend anymore, that it wasn\u2019t worth it to run out the rest of the night until the room rental was over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some hardworking, well-meaning African Americans working with and around the GOP for the incoming 45th president. However, if the Black Tie & Chic Gala is any indication, they aren\u2019t so much enthusiastic about Trump as they are just hoping that Republicans\u2019 being in power affords them a chance to make some changes that they think are helpful to African Americans, which is about as encouraging as Trump yelling, \u201cWhat have you got to lose?\u201d to black people during the campaign.

Everyone is talking about how much it has grown, how you can invest 75 cents into bitcoin on Monday, and by Friday you\u2019ll have enough money to qualify for the biggest tax cuts under the Republican Tax Plan for People Who Wear Boat Shoes, Monocles and Patagonia Sweaters (I think that\u2019s the official name).\n\nBut what is bitcoin? Why has bitcoin exploded? And, more important, why has bitcoin become the darling of the white supremacist movement?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root put together this explainer to answer all of your bitcoin-related questions.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency.\n\nThat\u2019s all you got? \u201cBitcoin is a cryptocurrency\u201d? What the hell is a cryptocurrency?\n\nSo you know what a currency is, right?\n\nOf course. It\u2019s money.\n\nOK, well imagine going to the bank, withdrawing all of your money in $1 bills, then writing down all of the serial numbers from each bill. What if there were someone who was willing to sell you things on the internet if you just gave them the serial numbers on your money?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin is essentially a system for storing and exchanging digital units of currency whose \u201cserial numbers\u201d are encrypted, making them anonymous and unhackable. They are held in \u201cwallets\u201d on a decentralized network of computers. It is essentially a PayPal for nerds.\n\nBut I can hold a dollar in my hand. Is bitcoin real?\n\nNot really, but neither is a dollar.\n\nWhat do you mean dollars aren\u2019t real? I can hold a dollar in my hand. I pay my rent with them. Tell Destinee the Diamond Goddess that dollars aren\u2019t real when I make it rain at the strip club.\n\nBefore tuning them out, have you ever heard Hoteps talk about \u201cfiat\u201d money, the Federal Reserve and how it\u2019s all a confidence game? Well, in this case (and probably only in this case), they are correct. In 1971, the U.S. dollar became the first national currency that was not backed by an actual commodity. Instead, the dollar is backed by \u201cthe full faith and credit of the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason you aren\u2019t homeless and are still able to receive lap dances is that you, your landlord and Destinee have agreed that dollars are worth something. Bitcoin is the same as the dollar, your checking account information or your credit card numbers. People have agreed that bitcoin is worth something, so it is worth something, although the people at the strip club won\u2019t let you into the champagne room if you try to pay them in bitcoin.\n\nSo why has bitcoin exploded lately?\n\nBecause bitcoin is the SZA of currencies.\n\nWait ... what?\n\nRemember a couple of months ago, when you first heard about this underground singer named SZA? I honestly thought that people were talking about the putrid baconlike substance from the \u201980s called \u201cSizzlean.\u201d No one knew who SZA was or why she hated vowels so much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has been around for quite a few years, just like SZA. Computer-savvy people used cryptocurrency to buy drugs, prostitutes and SZA albums over the internet. But, like SZA, bitcoin only became a superstar when mainstream white people \u201cdiscovered\u201d it. Now bitcoin is more than just a currency, it is a commodity.\n\nInstead of using it to buy things, people trade it based on its perceived value, like oil, Microsoft stock or SZA albums. It is not harder to make a barrel of oil today than it was 20 years ago. Microsoft isn\u2019t selling more software than it was two years ago. Their value increases or decreases based on popularity. SZA isn\u2019t a better singer than she was six months ago, but she is worth a lot more money now. So is bitcoin.\n\nIs that why white supremacists love it so much, because it\u2019s popular?\n\nNot quite.\n\nRemember a few months ago, when internet companies began ousting white supremacist organizations? Well, when it comes to finding loopholes, white people are nothing if not resourceful. Mic reports that white supremacist organizations began using bitcoin to collect donations after they were banned from using sites like PayPal and GoFundMe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the byproducts of cryptocurrency\u2019s exponential growth is that Nazis have made a lot of money from the bitcoin boom. According to Mic, John Bambenek, a cybersecurity researcher, estimates that Andrew Anglin, founder of the Daily Storm, has made $250,000 off of bitcoin. On Oct. 1, the site withdrew $64,353 from its account, the site reports. Some speculate that bitcoin is what Anglin uses to stay on the run and avoid a lawsuit that may bankrupt him and his business.\n\nSo racists like it because it makes them rich?\n\nWhite supremacists like bitcoin because it can fund the movement without the people who contribute being labeled white supremacists. The average, run-of-the-mill racists like it because they can donate without anyone knowing. Bitcoin is essentially a digital Ku Klux Klan hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the \u201calt-right\u201d Richard Spencer gave it his nod of approval.\n\nBy the way\u2014and this is not a joke\u2014can you guess what the first item ever purchased with bitcoin was?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you say cryptocurrency was an underground thing for white people, so I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t seasoning. Crystal meth? A \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat? A Taylor Swift box set?\n\nA pepperoni pizza from Papa Johns.\n\nSeems about right. So, the Nazi thing notwithstanding, should I invest in bitcoin?\n\nI am not a financial adviser, but most economists say you should buy low and sell high, and bitcoin is very high right now. You could jump on the bitcoin bandwagon, but when people realize that they\u2019re paying $1,000 for $5 worth of bitcoin, the market could crash. If history teaches us anything, it\u2019s that Caucasians will overpay for things. We saw it happen with the tech boom, the housing boom and marijuana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou think the marijuana industry is going to crash?\n\nNot as long as Snoop Dogg is alive. But before it became legal, very reliable sources told me that it was easy to convince white guys who wore boat shoes to buy an eighth of weed for $80.\n\nThe point is: Aside from racism and praise-dance performances, nothing lasts forever. All markets eventually self-correct. It is possible to make a lot of money in bitcoin, but it is also possible to lose money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do you know so much about bitcoin? :\n\nWell, aside from ranting about white people on the internet, I\u2019ve actually never taken a course in Caucasianology. I actually have a master\u2019s degree in international business, and most of my professional career was spent in macroeconomics. Studying white people has always been my passion, though.\n\nAlso ... Google.\n\nSo, as a professional in both areas, in which market would you suggest I invest and know it won\u2019t crash?\n\nThere are only two places I know you can put your money and get a guaranteed return:", "keywords": ["explained", "money", "worth", "know", "internet", "ago", "sza", "dollar", "numbers", "white", "bitcoin", "supremacists", "love"], "polarity": 0.13105499162395712, "subjectivity": 0.35590127050471876},

As such, the devil often needs a translator: Enter Sarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee. One of Suckabee\u2019s few jobs is to translate for the devil, who, for years, has been losing some of his pigment, and instead of being red is just Cheetos-dust-colored.\n\n\n\nSo it makes sense that Suckabee is out here doing the non-Lord\u2019s work. During a press briefing Monday, Suckabee was asked to clarify the president\u2019s comments in which he claimed that even if he didn\u2019t have a firearm, he would\u2019ve run into the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School during the mass shooting that left some 17 teachers and students dead. The comment came after the president criticized armed officers who didn\u2019t run into the school after hearing the commotion.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The president is a gilded-chair quarterback. This is what he does, and unfortunately, we don\u2019t need a translator because we fully understand this devil. But that didn\u2019t stop Suckabee from changing the narrative from the president is a boisterous, loudmouth air hole to the president is a boisterous, loudmouth air-hole leader!\n\nAccording to Suckabee, when he said that he would have run into the Parkland, Fla., school unarmed, he wasn\u2019t trying to shame those who didn\u2019t run in but, rather, was saying that his presence alone, as a leader, could\u2019ve been utilized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch her do her best devil translation below, and don\u2019t worry about whether she looks at herself in the mirror at night, because she can\u2019t see her reflection anyway.", "keywords": ["meant", "school", "devil", "sarah", "translator", "president", "suckabee", "wouldve", "sanders", "dont", "language", "really", "loudmouth", "didnt", "watch", "run"], "polarity": 0.01958333333333333, "subjectivity": 0.36027777777777775},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["conservative", "cpac", "sure", "conservatives", "list", "political", "im", "trumps", "video", "trump", "white", "convention", "introduce", "used", "black", "nigger", "watch", "pretty", "republican"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

It\u2019s significantly better on the diversity front than whitewashed Doctor Strange, or the minority-as-comedy-relief-sidekick-brigade antics of Ant-Man; and the references to race, history and culture by a group of smart high school kids are organic and believable in the film. But it falls way short of the fully integrated POC in Captain America: Civil War. It feels more like a mashup of a 1980s high school teen flick and Agent Cody Banks, with a few talking minority extras who are still revolving around the white-guy hero and villain.\n\nA-ho-ho-ho. I just saw the movie and, man, I do not agree.\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming was not only the best Spider-Man movie ever made\u2014beating out all Tobey Maguire versions and, blech, all Andrew Garfield garbage pictures\u2014but one of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, probably in the top five, next to Captain America: Winter Soldier, Black Panther (yeah, I put it in the top five and it hasn\u2019t come out yet; that trailer was hot fire!) and the original Avengers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst part of my dear friend Jason\u2019s review. Oh no. It was his slam that the diversity in Spider-Man: Homecoming, the kind that actually featured multiple characters of multiple ethnicities talking about things that had nothing to do with the main white character, was \u201cfaux diversity.\u201d\n\nSir, I know fake diversity when I see it. It\u2019s called \u201ctokenism,\u201d and it usually involves just a minor character who is the sole person of color in the entire film, with no agency, who is solely there to help the white hero, who never talks to any other people of color, and has no dreams or ambitions of his or her own. This is a character whose brownness or blackness is irrelevant because the role could have been played by a cardboard cutout of Michael Jordan from Space Jam the whole time.\n\nThis role did not exist in this movie.\n\nYes, Peter Parker\u2019s best friend, Ned, was played by a Filipino actor (Jacob Batalon). Yes, Ned had comic-relief elements about him. But Ned was not alone. Ned was not without desire and agency. And Ned was not without purpose. He didn\u2019t fall down and need to be rescued in the final act. He didn\u2019t disappear for the whole final act, either. Ned didn\u2019t only just talk to the white guy about how great he was. But again, most importantly, Ned was not alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were, not one, but two black girls\u2014Liz and Michelle (Laura Harrier and Zendaya Coleman)\u2014who had speaking parts that were fun and reflective of both teenage innocence/optimism and teenage bitterness/angst. (And I can\u2019t even recall if I\u2019ve ever seen a black girl be the Sylvia Plath-esque, existential \u201cangsty\u201d one in a film of any kind. So that was damn near groundbreaking. Never mind that in most Marvel movies, black women have been the nonfactors of superherodom. So to have two in a movie, one playing the romantic lead and the other undercutting everyone\u2019s joy with dry wit, was refreshing.)\n\nSuper jerk Flash Thompson was played by Tony Revolori, who is of Guatemalan descent. There was an African student who was seriously into his academic decathlon. There was a high school, in New York City, that looked a lot like the real-life Bronx Science, and was full of black and brown and Asian and biracial students and teachers. And there was the city\u2019s borough of Queens, full of all sorts of people of color, like the kind you will find in the actual Queens. And they all were just doing their thing, running sandwich shops and worrying about teenager stuff like detention and homecoming dances while Peter Parker was trying to save the world from an actual legit scary baddie in the form of my favorite Batman, Michael Keaton.\n\nAs for the complaint that Hollywood is fixated on casting black and biracial women as love interests in genre films and TV for white male heroes, so what? Who does this hurt? No one. For contrast, I sat through all of Jessica Jones, with skinny, white-ass Krysten Ritter, on Netflix, where she boned super black man Luke Cage (Mike Colter) six ways to Sunday and gave all of no shits. I mean, would I have preferred to see black love? Sure, I love black love! But then Marvel made a whole Luke Cage TV show and stuck Misty Knight (Simone Missick) and Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) in it, and I forgot Jessica Jones even happened!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the alternative is no black women in the movie at all, I choose \u201cStick some black women in it\u201d every time. Yeah, is it so common now that it\u2019s clich\u00e9? ROTFLMAO; of course it is! Is it true that racist nerds are more comfortable with Sue Storm being played by a Latino woman in a blond wig than Johnny Storm being played by a black guy in the form of Michael B. Jordan? Of course it is.\n\nDoes that mean Jessica Alba should turn down roles because shit\u2019s not fair? Of course not; that\u2019s crazy talk! The push should be for black characters and Latino characters and Asian characters to get to be well-rounded, fully fleshed-out characters, not that they shouldn\u2019t be there at all.\n\nNow, if the beef is that this isn\u2019t a Miles Morales Spider-Man movie\u2014Miles Morales being the awesome Afro-Latino Spider-Man in the comics\u2014I mean, sure, that would be a fun movie, too, but I talked to my younger sister, whose complete knowledge of Marvel movies begins with Iron Man and ends with her 5-year-old\u2019s love of Captain America, and she was like, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey don\u2019t make these movies just for me and you, Jason. They make them for the vast majority of America who is my sister, who is like, \u201cWho?\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean there will never, ever be a Miles Morales Spider-Man movie. They stuck a great Miles Morales Easter egg in the form of Donald Glover right smack dab in the middle of the movie for fans. It went over my sister\u2019s head, but I got it and loved it!\n\nIf the beef is, \u201cWell, it\u2019s yet another superhero movie with a white guy in it,\u201d I don\u2019t even know what to say. Should Marvel have not even bothered to cast all those black and brown people? Should we go back to the 2002 New York of Tobey Maguire Spider-Man, where one of the few people of color was Octavia Spencer\u2014who I forgot was even in the movie\u2014and her all five seconds of screen time? Could Marvel do more? Could Marvel do better? Of course it can! That\u2019s why Black Panther is coming to a theater near you in February 2018!\n\nThat said, despite your very wrong and not right Spider-Man opinions, I still love you like my very wrong play cousin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour editor", "keywords": ["spiderman", "oh", "cmon", "marvel", "love", "movie", "characters", "women", "black", "ned", "diversity", "homecoming", "white", "played", "jason", "counterpoint", "great"], "polarity": 0.10849608624788487, "subjectivity": 0.47898185347825595},

I have more faith in strangers at an Atlanta bar with my credit card.\n\nHowever, after the leaking of Colin Powell\u2019s emails, I am making room in the icebox where my heart s\u2019posed to be for this conservative of color. I\u2019ll never forget the role he played in the Iraq War, but after reading his thoughts about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, I\u2019ll at least invite him to a fish fry.

I now have the image of Powell going to the State Department and White House, giving his colleagues a smidgen of a smile and gracious nod, only to go back to his office and fire off emails with the subject, \u201cThis idiotic piece of s\u2014t.\u201d Or: \u201cI hate her. I hate him. I hate all of them. UGH.\u201d\n\nPowell is absolutely correct about the hubris of Clinton and about Trump being an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d and \u201cnational disgrace.\u201d I concur about Dick Cheney typically coming across as a \u201cscary idiot,\u201d and the Republican Party being a \"reality show.\u201d I\u2019m also curious to know whether he and Condoleezza Rice ever wanted to jump Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nStill, what\u2019s really changed my mind about Powell is that I never knew how much I needed a shady, mean old Jamaican man in my life until now. Actually, shady old people in general. I lost my grandparents years ago, and while our love was deep and pure and other old Mariah Carey lyrics, what I loved most about them was that they used to say whatever the hell was on their minds\u2014especially my grandmother. About any issue. About all people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mom is starting to enter this no-f\u2014ks-given stage of life, but she\u2019s Catholic, so she tends to feign guilt about whatever flies out of her mouth. I need someone older and, thus, more likely to just call someone out, take a sip of water or Paul Masson peach brandy, and call the next person out. I now believe that Colin Powell is that person, and I need someone to forward him this essay so that he can become my play paw-paw and email buddy.\n\nYou just know that Powell has far more to say about this election. I need to know what Powell makes of the following: Kellyanne Conway, who lies as well as Beyonc\u00e9 does everything; Reince Priebus, the Jackie Christie of political operatives; Donald Trump, any day of the week, based on whatever inane and/or insane comment he\u2019s made; and Hillary Clinton, in general.\n\nMoreover, who are these alleged women Bill Clinton is smashing? Is he using vegan condoms? And for some reason, I bet Powell watches Power. Does he hate Angela and Tariq, too?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are people penning articles about how to avoid Powell-like \u201cemail embarrassments.\u201d Excuse me, but this isn\u2019t embarrassing. This is an awakening.\n\nAs many of us as there are in America, there are six degrees of separation, which means that some of you Negroes reading this know Colin Powell. Do me a favor: Tell him about me. Give him my email. Let the shade continue. If our emails get hacked again, oh well. Clearly, Powell doesn\u2019t have any damns left to give.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

I\u2019m sure you are listing dates in your head. You\u2019re probably saying something about the year when European settlers landed in America and injected the continent with the uniquely Caucasian concept of manifest destiny. You might even ask, \u201cWhat about 1619, when the first slaves were brought to America, jump-starting white supremacy?\u201d\n\n\n\nMaybe you\u2019re considering 1860, when 11 states decided they\u2019d rather host the bloodiest war in the country\u2019s history than give up chattel slavery. Perhaps you think 1892 is the whitest year ever, when 161 black people were lynched, according to Tuskegee University\u2019s \u201cLynching, Whites and Negroes\u201d (pdf). Even 1989 might stand out in your mind if only because it was the year Taylor Swift was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNope. 2017 was worse.\n\nDespite the trouble and turmoil in all of those years, they pale in comparison with 2017. While the previously mentioned time periods were unquestionably white, they were usually less white than the previous year. Despite one\u2019s opinion on racism in this country, whether it\u2019s because of inevitability, progress or the sheer force of blacks fighting back, white supremacy has steadily lost its toehold in America. It is a foundation that we saw eroding with each revolution around the sun. Whiteness was like LeBron\u2019s hairline: fading but holding on.\n\nBut not this year.\n\nThis year, caucasity returned like Afros and bell-bottom jeans. Just when we thought it was defeated, it burst back into our living rooms, sat down on our sofas and screamed \u201cFuck yo\u2019 couch\u201d to anyone who could hear it. It wasn\u2019t just the achromatic versions of tears, privilege and fragility. It wasn\u2019t just racism or hate. It was whiteness itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhiteness is a liar.\n\n2017 tried to fool us into thinking that the collection of unmelanated degenerates who gathered on the National Mall to celebrate the goldfish-cracker in chief was the biggest crowd ever. It gave us a straw-haired skeleton queen named Kellyanne Conway to thrust the phrase \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon. It gifted us with Sean Spicer\u2019s befuddled fibbing, Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s confidence-man condescension and Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 blatant bullshitting as they stood in front of the press and lied in our faces. This was the year of \u201cboth sides,\u201d \u201cwhite lives\u201d and \u201cI do not recall.\u201d 2017 lied its ass off.\n\nWhiteness is a thief.\n\nPolice stole 220 black lives in 2017, more than the previously mentioned worst year of lynching. White women tried to rob black women of the credit for an Alabama election. They swiped the #MeToo movement from a black woman. 2017\u2019s whiteness tried to steal health care from those who couldn\u2019t afford it. It took tax breaks from the rich and gave to the poor. It stole the blame for violence from white supremacists and mass shooters and placed it at the feet of anti-fascists. And Black Lives Matter. And \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d And Chicago\u2019s top gang thugs. And Mexican immigrants. And Muslims. And everyone but white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhiteness is fragile.\n\nIn 2017, whiteness felt oppressed. It said that white people were discriminated against. It carried tiki torches while whining that it will not be replaced. It rallied for the cause in Charlottesville, Va. It cried when it found out it was in trouble. It called everyone else \u201csnowflakes\u201d but melted down when NFL players took a knee. It boo-hooed about white genocide. It reminded its fellow milky martyrs that it was \u201cOK to be white.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more than any other year, whiteness regressed. This country moonwalked backward instead of toward the light. 2017 put us in reverse, and it wasn\u2019t because Americans wanted to go backward. White people did.\n\nAfter millions enjoyed universal health care for the first time, they repealed the mandate for the Affordable Care Act and will eventually make insurance unaffordable again. They stripped away regulations that made the environment safe and kept Wall Street in line. They committed two of the five deadliest mass shootings in recent history and refused to pass any gun legislation.\n\nThey returned to mandatory minimums. They went back to mass incarceration. They took a regressive stance on marijuana. The Ku Klux Klan returned in force. Nazis started walking around proudly. Confederate sympathizers sprang out of nowhere. So did Confederate flags. And swastikas. And hate crimes. And people ranting in Starbucks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 might not be as white as 1860, but 1860 wasn\u2019t as white as 1859. 2017, on the other hand, is whiter than the previous year. And the one before that. And the one before that.\n\nThis was the year of whiteness\u2014not white supremacy, racism or any other euphemism for discrimination or hate. It was that, too. But it was more than that. It was a big, fat rolling back of the hands of time. Even if this country is getting demographically darker, white America is fighting to make it as white as it always was. White will always be the new white.\n\nWe thought we knew what they meant when they said they wanted to make America great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe forgot about the \u201cagain\u201d part.", "keywords": ["took", "whiteness", "tried", "whitest", "2017", "white", "america", "wasnt", "black", "returned", "racism"], "polarity": -0.002291092745638198, "subjectivity": 0.33280794962613136},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["conservative", "cpac", "sure", "conservatives", "list", "political", "im", "trumps", "video", "trump", "white", "convention", "introduce", "used", "black", "nigger", "watch", "pretty", "republican"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

He needs an audience and applause, and these events provide that.\n\n\n\nJust last week, Trump took another victory lap and held a campaign rally in Florida when he didn\u2019t need to.

He had run and lost a close election for Virginia attorney general back in 2013. This time he went bigger, seeking the lieutenant governorship, and had to face off against Susan Platt, a well-funded lobbyist many believed to be the preferred lieutenant gubernatorial candidate of incumbent Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the \u201cconventional wisdom,\u201d also known as Southern Democrats, didn\u2019t believe that a young African-American man like Fairfax would be able to win across the southern, western and more conservative parts of Virginia, and that a white woman would be able to win by securing the white female vote. How\u2019d that work out for Hillary Clinton? It turns out that a candidate with a solid background and a long history in the state who doesn\u2019t get caught faking endorsements from the American Civil Liberties Union can win a primary during a year of \u201cresistance.\u201d\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t just any primary. Enthusiasm among Virginia Democrats was so high, turnout jumped from 319,000 in 2009 to more than 500,000 Tuesday night, with votes for Fairfax still being counted as of this writing (total GOP primary turnout Tuesday was about 350,000).

It always focused on Virginians, making sure more people can afford their homes without taking on crushing debt, helping people with student loan debt, making high-quality vocational and technical training available for everyone, expanding Medicaid for over 400,000 people in Virginia. Just giving people the elements that allow so many families to thrive in this state.\n\nThe message of resisting the divisive hatred, xenophobia, racism and misogyny out there is what we\u2019re about.

In the case of African-American Republicans, the list is long. They are joined by a list of former GOP nominees for president who will not attend, which includes past GOP nominees for president Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Mitt Romney. While the number of African Americans in attendance at the GOP convention was already low, the 2016 convention may have the lowest in terms of big names.\n\nThe list of convention speakers reveals few African Americans. Of the 63 speakers listed by the Republican National Committee so far, only three are African American: the Rev. Darrell Scott, Dr. Ben Carson and Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke. The U.S. Senate's only African-American Republican, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who spent the last week speaking on the Senate floor on race and policing, isn't on the list. Whether he will be in Cleveland at all is unclear.\n\nThe reason for so many convention no-shows is easy to identify: Donald Trump.

From calling for a ban on members of a religious group to violence at his rallies, negative statements about women and talk of \"building a wall\" as his approach to immigration, many elected officials and others are not running toward the brand of Trump and his views.\n\nA torrent of rumors popped up that Cleveland-based boxing promoter Don King and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson would be speaking in Cleveland. During a speech in Cincinnati on July 6, Trump announced that King would be speaking. But just like so much of what the New York real estate mogul has said, the claim evaporated. It turns out that King isn't on the list of speakers. Trump stated that his convention would be filled with celebrities and have a \"big show\" feel. So far, none of the African-American stars rumored are scheduled to appear.\n\nMaryland Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, an African American, isn't coming to Cleveland. Instead, he'll be at the Baltimore Maryland Crabfest with Gov. Larry Hogan, who isn't going to the GOP convention, either. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to stay home, too\u2014even after a \"Draft Condi\" group attempted to inject her name into the race, first to run an independent race against Trump, then to be Trump's vice presidential nominee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 25, Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah), clearly a young rising star in the party, announced that she would not be attending the convention. Love told the local press in Utah, \"I don't see the upsides to it,\" and \"I don't see how it benefits the state,\" as she spoke on why she would be a no-show.\n\nLove will give up her place as a convention delegate and instead travel to Israel. This move is a far cry from the 2012 Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., when she enjoyed a prime-time speaking slot. Love is in what is expected to be a close race with her 2014 challenger, Democrat Doug Owens.\n\nLove's predicament is the same as that of the U.S. House's other African-American Republican, Rep. Will Hurd of Texas. Both are expected to have a difficult time winning re-election after only one House term. Hurd was elected by only 2,422 votes in 2014, and Love won by only 4,225 votes. Both are facing challengers who are attempting to tie them to Trump even though neither will be in Cleveland for the Republican convention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet another reason to be no-shows.\n\nLauren Victoria Burke is a Washington, D.C.-based political reporter who writes the Crew of 42 blog.

Johnson is a veteran political analyst, writer and politics professor at Morgan State University. (Although I have no idea how he does all of this, because every time I turn on my TV, he is a guest on various news shows explaining politics to the audience. My personal theory is that there is a group of highly intelligent Jason Johnson clones who study politics by night and educate the public by day.)\n\nEverything was going along swimmingly until they delved into the April Ryan-Sean Spicer controversy. Then this happened:\n\nStop shaking your head.\n\nThis exchange is a perfect illustration of an argument The Root tries to make daily: White people do not get to determine whether something is racist or not, and Johnson tries to make this point before the discourse turns into a boxing-match promotion. (By the way, Vegas has 3-1 odds on Johnson in the fifth round.)\n\nUnlike most of the White House pool, April Ryan ain\u2019t scared of the Trump administration, and \u201cScrappy-Doo\u201d Spicer doesn\u2019t like that. For context, we should remember that Ryan is the same correspondent who confronted Donald Trump about dodging the Congressional Black Caucus, and Donald Doll-Hands responded by asking her to set up a cookout for him to meet them. Ryan is the same reporter whom the Trump administration\u2019s secretary of black stuff\u2014Omarosa Manigault\u2014threatened by telling Ryan that the White House had a dossier on her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who thinks that telling an adult human being what she should do with her body has nothing to do with her sex or race should refer to the time NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander told Trump his Electoral College boasts were lies, and Trump told him to stop smiling. You should stream the video of how condescendingly Spicer treated CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta when Acosta asked the same question about Russia that Ryan asked. Maybe Johnson didn\u2019t see the clip when Spicer told another correspondent to sit down, or to stop acting like that.\n\nOh, right. That has never happened\u2014except to April Ryan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhenever the Ronald McDonald of presidents is confronted on his racism, anti-Semitism or xenophobia, he always responds with, \u201cI am the least racist person you know,\u201d and moves on to the next subject of his incompetence. In his mind, painting black people as poorly educated victims of inner-city crime or in need of \u201claw and order,\u201d or insinuating that all Muslims are terrorists-in-waiting, isn\u2019t racist because it\u2019s not what he meant. Many Caucasians don\u2019t hate people of color, and since they don\u2019t get on their knees and ask strawberry-blond Jesus to wipe black people off the face of the earth, nothing that they ever do could possibly be racist.\n\nSchlapp\u2019s writing off of Sean Spicer\u2019s act as not racist or sexist would be the equivalent of his watching Spicer run over Ryan with a truck and explaining it away by saying, \u201cShe can\u2019t be hurt because he didn\u2019t mean to hit her. Come on, Spicer has a lot of stuff going on when he drives, but he drives like this all the time. Stop complaining just because he crushed her internal organs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how anything works.\n\nRacism and sexism are measured by their impact, not their intent. You don\u2019t get to punch people in the mouth and tell them whether or not they should bleed. Jason Johnson tried to explain this to Schlapp, but the conservative water carrier took exception to Johnson because\u2014of course\u2014Schlapp understands that the white-privilege emergency kit comes with explicit instructions on deflecting racism: Never admit to its existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is the problem.\n\nSchlapp yelled at, turned his back on and interrupted Johnson for the same reason Spicer reprimanded Ryan: because Spicer and Schlapp can\u2019t bear to hear anyone contradict their lies. Spicer is apt to get plum-faced and confrontational with anyone, as is Schapp\u2014but the disrespect of Johnson and Ryan is indicative of Spicer\u2019s and Schlapp\u2019s privilege. Their whiteness endows them with enough arrogance to tell another human being to shut the hell up. How dare April Ryan question Sean Spicer just because she is paid to ask questions during a question-and-answer session? What gives Jason Johnson the right to comment on racism just because MSNBC invited him to specifically comment on racism?\n\nJohnson knows that the only reason anyone would tell a grown-ass woman what she could do with her body is sexism or racism. Perhaps neither Spicer nor Shlapp even realizes that their actions are subtle acts of reductive supremacy. During this entire exchange, I couldn\u2019t turn the channel or scream at the television because I couldn\u2019t believe that in 2017, Johnson actually had to sit on national TV and explain why a white man telling a black woman what she can do with her body, emotions and gestures wasn\u2019t acceptable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was even more flabbergasted at the sight of a white man telling Johnson\u2014and I\u2019m paraphrasing here\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about when it comes to racism, but I do.\u201d I wanted to scream or at least have Johnson\u2019s clone invite him outside.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stop shaking my head.", "keywords": ["whitesplaining", "msnbc", "ryan", "black", "stop", "telling", "called", "trump", "racist", "white", "johnson", "racism", "jason", "conservative", "roots", "spicer", "heated"], "polarity": 0.010828630694702116, "subjectivity": 0.337312216553288},

What was different in 2017, more so than any other year in recent memory, was how those polarities were laid bare for everyone else to see.\n\n\n\nIt was the year American streets were crowded with both pussy hats and neo-Nazis. It was the year Confederate monuments were torn from their bases and irate NFL fans cursed at their TVs as black players kneeled en masse. Both \u201ccomplicit\u201d and \u201cfeminism\u201d were designated \u201cwords of the year\u201d (the first by Dictionary.com, the second by Merriam-Webster\u2019s) in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a year that saw the careers of dozens of the world\u2019s most powerful men crash and burn while a man accused of multiple instances of sexual abuse continued to tweet from the Oval Office. It was the year a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. It was the year an alleged pedophile was endorsed by the most powerful man in the free world.\n\nLooking back on the year, no one work sums up the horrors and polarities of the year more than Get Out. It was undoubtedly the movie of 2017: a genre-bending film that managed to feel both timely and overdue. But what makes it not just the film of 2017, but emblematic of it, is best captured in audiences\u2019 divergent reactions to it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Seth Meyers on his late-night show, Allison Williams, who plays the film\u2019s surprise villain, Rose Armitage, describes the reaction she received from white people who had trouble believing that her character, a woman who preyed upon black people, was actually evil:\n\nThey\u2019d say, \u201cShe was hypnotized, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s just evil!\u201d How hard is that to accept? She\u2019s bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she\u2019s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That\u2019s so crazy! And they\u2019re still like, \u201cBut maybe she\u2019s also a victim?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNO! No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence.

Mind you, not the ankh-wearing, incense-selling, lecture-women-about-their menstrual-cycles kind of Hotep.\n\nI was more Hotep-adjacent. Hidden beneath my public-Ivy education and functional relationship with my parents lurked a man who would disappear down YouTube click holes of Tariq Nasheed, Professor Griff, ZaZa Ali and, of course, Dr. Umar Johnson. I comfortably conflated the performance of Hotepness with the actual work of black nationalism.\n\nOr, at least, I did until I actually had a chance to see Johnson speak live at a Black History Month panel. That\u2019s when I, like an alcoholic, drug addict or R. Kelly fan, had my moment of clarity and realized that my Hotepness had to stop. There is no space for men like Johnson in any real fight for black liberation, and the sooner black folk collectively kick them to the curb, the better.\n\nI grew up steeped in \u201990s black conspiracy culture, which made me highly susceptible to pseudo-nationalist Hotep thinking by the mid-2000s. Crack cocaine pushed into black neighborhoods, President Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill and eugenics experiments in Baltimore public schools were my reality. Given what was actually happening in America, it wasn\u2019t a big leap to entertain more extreme ideas like HIV/AIDS was a government conspiracy, gangsta rap was a psy-op to destroy the black family and orange soda really did cause sterility in black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, as time, age and education set in, you start distinguishing between actual white supremacy (the prison-industrial complex) and unfounded conspiracy (the Bill Cosby rape charges were meant to keep him from buying what, exactly?), but there was a small part of me that still held on to the purveyors of more sordid and unsourced forms of knowledge, like Umar Johnson.\n\nAfter years of listening to him online at the gym or in my car, last month I drove to Morgan State University in Baltimore to hear him speak in person for the first time. I dragged a good friend of mine (she\u2019s a Ph.D. in political science) along to serve as a healthy skeptic to my ridiculous enthusiasm.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of him, Johnson, the Philadelphia-based \u201cPrince of Pan-Africanism,\u201d is a psychologist and lecturer who specializes in protecting black boys (and girls?) from the damaging effects of white supremacy in public education. Most black folks became aware of him around 2014 when he began raising money to buy the defunct HBCU St. Paul\u2019s College in Lawrenceville, Va., and turn it into a boy\u2019s academy. He\u2019s all over YouTube; is constantly speaking on black relationships, politics and education; and seems genuinely interested in the well-being of black people. Sounds good, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJason, you know that man is a misogynist and lied about his relationship with a \u2018conscious stripper,\u2019 right?\u201d my friend said.\n\nWell, yeah \u2026\n\n\u201cYou know that man is a fraud and has been raising money for St. Paul\u2019s without their permission for years and ain\u2019t none of that money gone anywhere but his pockets, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, but \u2026\n\nYet she persisted, pointing out that the man we were going to see is called \u201cDr.\u201d despite the fact that no one can find his Ph.D. anywhere. Maybe it\u2019s hidden somewhere next to Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nOf course, all of this raises the question: Why would an otherwise smart person like me (and many others) tolerate a man like Johnson who traffics in racial half-truths, lies and misogyny? Because, like a black deplorable, he spoke to some racial truths that I believed, even if everything else he said was a dangerous lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we got to the Morgan State student union, the room was packed and Johnson was onstage for a Q&A flanked by two faculty members who were there for balance. However, \u201cDr. Johnson\u201d was clearly the main event, and he definitely put on a show, yelling at the crowd:\n\n\u201cJesus Cracker comes from Europe! Jesus Cracker looks like Michael Bolton!\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil we crucify, condemn and castrate the white Jesus, our people will be oppressed!\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverything Johnson said brought screams and cheers from the crowd, women calling for his room number and men chanting his name, even if his one-liners were reheated cipher rhetoric you could have heard at a spoken-word concert in 2002.\n\nJohnson and the Hotep chorus he represents fill a need for a black community living in a confusing, dehumanizing and violently oppressive world. There is a large swath of black America that needs to hear, in no uncertain terms, that racism is a real, tangible thing that hurts and chokes and stifles life. They don\u2019t need to hear it sandwiched between jokes on The Breakfast Club, and they don\u2019t want nuanced sound bite explanations on CNN or MSNBC. They need a primal scream, racial catharsis, and if that comes with a side order of sexism, homophobia and crackpot theories, so be it; at least somebody is saying something. That is why Johnson can appeal to the young and old, the educated and the working class, and even the very people whom he condemns (gays and women) in most of his lectures.\n\nThe problem is, everyone in the room was buying everything Johnson was selling without checking for receipts. I was used to listening to him alone, and parsing out the things I agreed with while downplaying or ignoring the rest. To see him publicly slide from over-the-top racial politics to ridiculous conspiracy theories without anyone blinking was disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson blamed the spread of AIDS on down-low black men (while making no mention of safe sex or condoms). He charged that homosexuality was a creation of the white man as a form of black-population control (ignoring the thousand-year history of multiple gender roles in Africa). He claimed that Barack Obama made black folks complacent and unwilling to fight (I guess #BlackLivesMatter didn\u2019t start under Obama?). He topped it off by claiming that black women (whose wombs are magical) commit genocide when they have abortions. How could anyone fall for this nonsense?\n\nA student who went by the name Chinedu told me afterward: \u201cI\u2019m a gay black man. I don\u2019t agree with all that he says, but we have to meet at the table.\u201d\n\nAnother man I spoke to was standing in the aisles yelling at the moderator: \u201cI need this! I need this!\u201d He told me that Johnson was the only man out there who spoke to men like him, that he\u2019d been through some thangs that only Johnson could explain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was painful to watch, but in that moment it dawned on me why some part of me had clung to men like Johnson despite my knowing full well that they trafficked in papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Pan-Africanism. Umar Johnson was a way of clinging to my intellectual youth, when fighting white supremacy just meant giving provocative speeches, raising some money and drinking alkaline water.\n\nI know real black nationalists and Pan-Africanists, men and women who have fought, bled and been teargassed for the liberation of all black people\u2014not just the ones who fit a certain moral, sexual or political framework. There are many men and women out there delivering the same hard truths as Johnson without the sexism, misogyny, ignorance and false credentials. I\u2019m a bit disturbed that it took me this long to remove this fraud from my mental playlist, but after 20 years, closet Hoteppin\u2019 is a hard habit to break.", "keywords": ["money", "know", "hidden", "women", "need", "black", "racial", "cured", "man", "johnson", "white", "umar", "hotep", "men"], "polarity": 0.022964804292929308, "subjectivity": 0.4345585317460314},

After a period of exasperating sighs and side eyes once I was done writing, I stumbled onto another article on The Root from Jason Johnson, who makes the case for why Zendaya is not the progress we are looking for. According to Johnson, Marvel\u2019s casting of Zendaya is pandering and giving black women and people of color a false sense of progress.\n\nThis couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.\n\nFull disclosure: I know Johnson, and we tweet to each other all the time. We\u2019ve met and hung out together at Dragon Con, a multigenre fiction gathering that takes place annually in Atlanta. He is an awesome guy, knows his comics and is one of the coolest blerds I know.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t always see eye to eye on some issues, and this article is one of them. I know there is a large contingent of people out there who are not too fond of racebending. Racebending is when a canonical white character is replaced by a person of color. In this case, Mary Jane Watson, who has always been white, will be played by Zendaya, a black woman.\n\nI understand that most people (and I\u2019m one of them) want to see new original black characters. When Miles Morales, an Afro-Latino Spider-Man, was created by Brian Michael Bendis, the character underwent a lot of criticism. There were fans of Spider-Man who only wanted Peter Parker, and there were Miles Morales fans who wanted him to be more than just a 2.0 version of a costume worn by a nerdy white kid from Queens, N.Y.\n\nI completely empathize with wanting more for characters of color. However, Johnson\u2019s critique can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. To discern the big picture here, we need to understand that having a black character or character of color represented in a major Marvel property like Spider-Man is kind of a big deal. It was not so long ago that hashtags like #MarvelSoWhite and public scrutiny over Marvel\u2019s obsession with white guys named Chris made it evident that the studio had a bit of a diversity problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s get back to Mary Jane Watson. Is she a superheroine? No. Is she a sidekick and just a girlfriend? No. Is she more of a prolific character in the Marvel universe than the examples used by Johnson, like Pepper Potts and Jane Foster? Absolutely!\n\nLet\u2019s be frank here: Most people knew who Mary Jane was long before this film was announced, and even before the live-action 2002 Sam Raimi film was released. Spider-Man is far more popular than Thor and Iron Man combined. From comics to animation to video games and merchandising, Spider-Man\u2019s imagery and legacy are embedded in the fabric of pop culture. Basically, if you are alive and breathing, you know who Spider-Man is. As for those other Avengers? Not so much.\n\nSo Mary Jane is not going to be treated like other love interests of other superheroes. She plays a significant role in this universe, and I feel strongly that Zendaya\u2019s casting was calculated and intentional based on the spirit of who M.J. is and not just because Marvel wants to bring in a black audience. Marvel has never had an issue with bringing in black dollars. The Avengers still holds up as one of the top-five-grossing movies of all time. Marvel has broken box-office records with each release, and needs no help bringing in more moviegoers. So the \u201cbring in black dollars\u201d argument is null and void.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary Jane is actually an integral part of Peter\u2019s story. She\u2019s his colleague, his girlfriend and, later, his wife. Many of Spider-Man\u2019s run-ins with villains like Green Goblin, Venom, Mephisto and others were the catalysts behind Peter\u2019s relationship with M.J. She is the link between Peter Parker and Spider-Man. So to refer to her as a side character diminishes who she is as well as her comic book history.\n\nJohnson would rather see racebending occur with the superheroes themselves and gives examples like Captain America and Iron Man. I\u2019m not certain if those characters will ever be racebent, but if they, in fact, are, you are arguing for racebending while condemning it at the same time. So what exactly is your position here?\n\nIf the concern is not seeing enough marginalized superheroes, then keep in mind that Black Panther comes out in 2018 and Captain Marvel in 2019. And yes, while we all wanted the second incarnation of Captain Marvel Monica Rambeau, who is black, to play the role, the fact that we finally have a female-led superhero film from Marvel is damn near a miracle in itself. If Marvel really wants to get innovative, I would like to see a live-action Ms. Marvel film featuring Kamala Khan come out next, along with Lunella Lafayette getting her movie adaptation from the Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Marvel series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, let\u2019s not dismiss other black women with roles in upcoming Marvel properties. Tessa Thompson is playing Valkyrie in the next Thor film, which is a very big deal. The Dora Milaje, Black Panther\u2019s all-female guard, will be featured in the new Black Panther film. And Simone Missick is playing Misty Knight in the upcoming Luke Cage series premiering on Netflix Sept. 30.\n\nWe have no idea what is to come from having Misty Knight finally featured in a live-action show. However, knowing what we all know about Marvel\u2019s seamless connectivity between its TV and movie universes, if there is ever an opportunity to do a Fearless Defenders series or movie, we will have two black female defenders. That\u2019s right. The Fearless Defenders was a book published back in 2013 that featured an all-female team with both Valkyrie and Misty Knight as its leaders.\n\nI am a huge critic of Marvel and I\u2019ve been very public about my opinions, but I think Marvel, slowly but surely, is trying to get it right with its diversity problems. Marvel still has a long way to go, especially with the Iron Fist and Doctor Strange castings, which have been incredibly problematic to fans within the Asian-American community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of the day, representation does matter. Black men will get to see themselves reflected through T\u2019Challa in Black Panther, and white women will get to see themselves reflected through Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel. However, for us as black women, it is just as much of a win for us to get Misty Knight, Valkyrie and the Dora Milaje as it is to have a black Mary Jane Watson.\n\nJamie Broadnax is the managing editor and creator of the online community for black women called Black Girl Nerds.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["teacher", "remember", "school", "victims", "teachers", "notes", "check", "going", "trump", "listening", "white", "violent", "care", "house", "president", "massshooting"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["day", "youre", "person", "nra", "trump", "matter", "age", "convention", "gun", "white", "shot", "black", "guns", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

She is a real, down-home patriot. So much so that she unwittingly promoted Russian-coordinated events on Facebook in support of Donald Trump. Goldfarb, who runs the Team Trump Broward County Facebook page, was one of the 53 percent of white women who backed Trump in 2016 and likely didn\u2019t need Russia\u2019s help to do it. But CNN reports that she did, in fact, promote pro-Trump events that were encouraged by Russian trolls on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they were involved or not,\u201d she told a CNN reporter when confronted about her involvement in Russia-backed events organized by the Being Patriotic Facebook page. \u201cThat\u2019s the least important thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo a foreign adversary meddles in the U.S. elections and uses you in the process, yet you are patriotic? OK, Becky. OK.\n\nWhen the reporter told her that the group was Russian-backed, she denied it\u2014after saying she didn\u2019t care if Russia was involved or not. \u201cI don\u2019t go with the Russians,\u201d she said. Goldfarb said all the people at her meetings were Trump supporters.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing, though. Russia didn\u2019t create fake events. They simply found real Trump supporters and backed their cause. CNN reported that Goldfarb and other Trump backers in Florida were duped into believing that they were communicating electronically and over the phone with other Trump supporters. Often, they were speaking to Russians willing to offer financial and logistical support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the people tricked into believing the Being Patriotic Facebook page\u2014which was run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll group in St. Petersburg, Russia (who also had 13 of its members indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller)\u2014was Harry Miller. He was paid \u201c$1,000 by the Russians to build a cage that was used to depict a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison cell at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida in August 2016,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nThe person with whom Miller spoke on the phone didn\u2019t speak fluent English. Figuring that the person was a first-generation immigrant, Miller didn\u2019t find that suspicious.\n\n\u201cThey had that beautiful website, were very supportive of the candidate, and there was nothing, nothing at all, that lends you to think it was anything other that people trying to support a candidate,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, at least Miller seems to believe he was tricked.\n\nGoldfarb? Not so much. When the CNN reporter probed her about her communications with Russians connected to Being Patriotic, she denied it and said, \u201cHillary Clinton was and so was her bandits, Mueller.\u201d\n\n\u201cBandit\u201d is not a term you hear in the American vernacular every day, but it is commonly used to describe criminals in Russia. Even in Ukraine, where I visit often, the word \u201cbandit\u201d is commonly used to describe criminals. I highly suspect that while Goldfarb may not have met with Russians in person, she may have picked up the word from conversing with Russians electronically or over the phone.

Under most circumstances, a failed presidential party nominee running for a Senate seat wouldn\u2019t be big news. It\u2019d be the equivalent of LeBron James retiring to become a player-coach for Duke after realizing he couldn\u2019t beat Golden State.\n\nHowever, since the 2016 presidential election, Romney has been reimagined by much of the public, and many members on the right, as some sort of moral center and lead anti-Trumpist for the Republican Party. A man willing to call out President Donald Trump for his many foul and inappropriate deeds. Just check out these hits:\n\n\n\nWho can forget Romney calling Trump a phony and a fraud during the 2016 presidential election season?\n\nOr the remix version, when brave Romney called Trump a comforter of and cheerleader for racists after the president\u2019s comments on the Charlottesville, Va., terror attack? From Facebook:\n\nWhether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn. His apologists strain to explain that he didn\u2019t mean what we heard. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, the feeling was mutual. Donald Trump holds a lot of grudges against Mitt Romney.\n\nHe\u2019s never forgiven Romney for calling him a fraud and a phony; he was furious that prominent Republicans wanted Romney to run as a third-party candidate in 2016; and last, Trump probably can\u2019t get over the fact that even though they\u2019re only a year apart in age, Romney\u2019s mane is always perfectly laid, while Trump\u2019s head looks like he\u2019s had more implants than Stormy Daniels.\n\nDemonstrating the penchant for pettiness that has defined his presidency, Trump spent the first few months after the election engaging in an elaborate Lucy-and-the-football scheme, with Romney doing the most earnest Charlie Brown impression possible. And after months of publicly wining and dining Romney, Trump turned around and gave the job of secretary of state to Rex Tillerson, a Russian-business crony with less experience than on Romney\u2019s pre-Massachusetts r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t enough; late last year, Trump actively tried to block Romney from running for Senate. In other words, if Romney had even the slightest drop of personal integrity, or even cared about his brand as the moral opposite of Trump, or wanted to keep those rumors alive that he might actually primary Trump in 2020, he\u2019d stick to his guns like he did in 2016, right? He would run for Utah Senate as the anti-Trump or at least make it clear that he was his own man.\n\nExcept no. Mitt Romney is a spineless, craven politician thirsty for any semblance of relevance after America rejected his brand of disingenuous, sanctimonious leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny dreams that he would stand up to Trump (and those had to be drug-induced fantasies born of nothing more than an unrealistic faith in a politician who said that 47 percent of the country wasn\u2019t worth talking to) went out the window when he tweeted this on Monday:\n\nMind you, Trump has never apologized or changed his tune about Charlottesville; within the last week, more women have come out to accuse him of sexual improprieties; and he was defending an alleged abusive spouse less than two weeks ago\u2014and that was after he wholeheartedly endorsed a man accused of molesting teenage girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, now Romney is proud to have this endorsement that was supposedly too awful to accept two years ago. I would say that the voters of Utah deserve better, but they elected Mia Love, so there is that.\n\nI think conservatives deserve better, because if they actually want to run someone for the Senate who will at least morally stand up to Trump, they might want to nominate someone who can at least get off his hands and knees first.", "keywords": ["mitt", "americas", "romney", "presidential", "utah", "week", "trump", "2016", "thirstiest", "election", "politician", "run", "senate"], "polarity": 0.14503375977256575, "subjectivity": 0.46543176972281447},
{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/theres-a-theory-that-black-people-buying-guns-could-sto-1823167744", "title": "/theres-a-theory-that-black-people-buying-guns-could-sto-", "text": "Before one begins any discussion about the gun debate, it is necessary to dismiss the slow-thinking zealots from the room by pointing out that two things can be true: I can believe that Church\u2019s fried chicken is actually deep-fried Triceratops raised on a secret Jurassic Park-type farm, and it tastes delicious. I also believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides us the right to gun ownership, and there is a need for commonsense gun legislation.\n\n\n\nI believe in the right to vote, but recognize that I must register and provide proof of identity. I believe in freedom of assembly, but I know that I can\u2019t organize a parade on the busiest intersection of my city without a permit. Every right afforded by the Constitution is regulated. While this may seem obvious, I point this out because someone will inevitably raise the idiotic argument that the ultimate goal of anyone in favor of gun control legislation is to kick in your door, snatch your weapons, drink the last bit of Kool-Aid and eat the big piece of chicken.\n\nAfter the most recent mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. (which may not be the most recent by the time I finish this sentence), some have theorized that one way to force gun control is to pit the intersecting groups in the Venn diagram of conservatism against each other. The argument is, if black people started purchasing firearms in bulk, conservative racists (or is it \u201cracist conservatives\u201d? I get confused sometimes) might get so outraged at the thought of gun-toting Negroes that racism might overwhelm their natural predilection for firearms and cause them to support gun-reform laws.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. I\u2019ve even said it before. White men have always been afraid of armed black people. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed, in part, because during Reconstruction, the South was inundated with newly formed groups dedicated to disarming blacks. The most famous of these organizations was a fraternity of men who called themselves the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Gov. Ronald Reagan fought for gun control legislation after another group of black men called Black Panthers marched on California\u2019s Capitol carrying shotguns. California\u2019s Mulford Act eventually became the blueprint for the Gun Control Act of 1968, the law banning felons from owning firearms and outlawing Saturday night specials, cheap handguns associated with black communities.\n\nThis makes the math seem simple: If black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation. While no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America\u2019s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won\u2019t work.\n\nWhen people talk about commonsense gun legislation, we wrongly assume that rank-and-file Republican voters are against it. However, 70 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of all Americans favor banning assault-style weapons, according to an October 2017 Gallup Poll. A 2016 CNN poll (pdf) showed that 92 percent of white people favored universal background checks, and 89 percent of whites favored stopping felons and people with mental health issues from owning guns.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the prevailing narrative would have you believe that gun owners are against gun reform, they are not. There is only one entity preventing legislative gun reform, and it is not Republicans, white people or even gun owners.\n\nIt is the National Rifle Association.\n\nTo be clear, it is not the members of the NRA who oppose gun control. Data from Pew research shows that the majority of NRA members are in favor of universal background checks, closing gun-show loopholes and preventing the mentally ill from purchasing weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the NRA boasts 4.5 million members (a dubious claim that most researchers don\u2019t believe), the NRA\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t come from its member rolls. The organization\u2019s power comes from its ability to lobby lawmakers, essentially bribing them with barrels of cash. More important, the stacks of money don\u2019t come from dues; they come from gun manufacturers.\n\nThe reason there is not gun reform is that the NRA is not the mythical nationwide coterie of gun nuts that most people would have you believe. It represents gun manufacturers, and gun manufacturers wouldn\u2019t care if black people bought guns. In fact, they\u2019d love it.\n\nFor instance, there are millions of people who donate to the NRA who have no idea they are doing so. Sturm, Ruger manufactured more than 1.6 million guns in 2017 and gave $1 to the NRA every time it sold a firearm. The Taurus company buys a year\u2019s membership for every person who purchases one of its guns, about 92,000 in 2012, according to Shooting Industry. There are shooting ranges across the country that include an NRA membership in the cost of their visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are millions of Nation Rifle Association members who have no idea they are in the NRA! Advertising, sponsorships and corporate donations account for most of the money received by the NRA. Less than half of the money the NRA rolls out to purchase the souls of politicians in exchange for the blood of children comes from membership dues.\n\nBecause of this, the NRA is not beholden to its rank and file. It has become the lobbying wing of the gun industry, and there is only one thing stronger than racism in America:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed.\n\nThe prospect of black people armed to the teeth is actually a good thing for the NRA because it is the de facto supplier of America\u2019s addiction. Thinking that the NRA will ever be concerned about a 12-point rise in African-American gun ownership (the increase that would raise black gun ownership to 36 percent, the same as whites) is like expecting the cigarette industry to care about a rise in black smokers. It just means more money for them.\n\nEven if most white people were racists who were scared shitless because black people started buying AR-15s, the NRA would care as much about that as it cared about dead first-graders in Newtown, Conn., or high school freshmen in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nSo, yes, black people should exercise their right to gun ownership for a number of reasons. But doing so won\u2019t cause the NRA to stop its war against children, no matter how racist or fragile white America may seem.\n\nSadly, two things can be true at the same time.", "keywords": ["money", "theres", "buy", "believe", "control", "nra", "war", "right", "ownership", "stop", "wont", "nras", "white", "gun", "theory", "black", "guns", "kids", "members"], "polarity": 0.04240483654276759, "subjectivity": 0.489879832810867},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups.

The store owner, Vance Hopkins, refused to sell Mason a gun because ... umm ... well, Hopkins didn\u2019t give a reason on the video, but in the two-minute clip, Mason said that the owner declined to sell him a firearm because Hopkins claimed to have \u201creason to believe\u201d Mason would sell it to someone else.\n\nThe video shows Mason turning to a man behind the counter who appears to work at the gun store (and \u201ctackle shop\u201d\u2014just in case you like to go fish-shooting) and asking how many times he had purchased firearms at the store.

I\u2019ve purchased a few from here.\u201d\n\nAfter the video began spreading, white people many defended Hopkins\u2019 right to refuse service to black people Mason, citing the number of shootings in the area and the fact that Mason was not alone, which they say indicated that he might be purchasing guns for other people. Apparently, there is some unwritten rule that black people must always be by themselves in certain places of businesses.

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["day", "youre", "person", "nra", "trump", "matter", "age", "convention", "gun", "white", "shot", "black", "guns", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["day", "youre", "person", "nra", "trump", "matter", "age", "convention", "gun", "white", "shot", "black", "guns", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right?

The optics are especially bad given that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz used his legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle to gun down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\u201cA White House photographer confirmed to CBS News that there are photos of the bill signing.

As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way.

However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["day", "youre", "person", "nra", "trump", "matter", "age", "convention", "gun", "white", "shot", "black", "guns", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep.

But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["day", "youre", "person", "nra", "trump", "matter", "age", "convention", "gun", "white", "shot", "black", "guns", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

It\u2019s called \u201ctokenism,\u201d and it usually involves just a minor character who is the sole person of color in the entire film, with no agency, who is solely there to help the white hero, who never talks to any other people of color, and has no dreams or ambitions of his or her own. This is a character whose brownness or blackness is irrelevant because the role could have been played by a cardboard cutout of Michael Jordan from Space Jam the whole time.\n\nThis role did not exist in this movie.\n\nYes, Peter Parker\u2019s best friend, Ned, was played by a Filipino actor (Jacob Batalon). Yes, Ned had comic-relief elements about him. But Ned was not alone. Ned was not without desire and agency. And Ned was not without purpose. He didn\u2019t fall down and need to be rescued in the final act. He didn\u2019t disappear for the whole final act, either. Ned didn\u2019t only just talk to the white guy about how great he was. But again, most importantly, Ned was not alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were, not one, but two black girls\u2014Liz and Michelle (Laura Harrier and Zendaya Coleman)\u2014who had speaking parts that were fun and reflective of both teenage innocence/optimism and teenage bitterness/angst. (And I can\u2019t even recall if I\u2019ve ever seen a black girl be the Sylvia Plath-esque, existential \u201cangsty\u201d one in a film of any kind. So that was damn near groundbreaking. Never mind that in most Marvel movies, black women have been the nonfactors of superherodom. So to have two in a movie, one playing the romantic lead and the other undercutting everyone\u2019s joy with dry wit, was refreshing.)\n\nSuper jerk Flash Thompson was played by Tony Revolori, who is of Guatemalan descent. There was an African student who was seriously into his academic decathlon. There was a high school, in New York City, that looked a lot like the real-life Bronx Science, and was full of black and brown and Asian and biracial students and teachers. And there was the city\u2019s borough of Queens, full of all sorts of people of color, like the kind you will find in the actual Queens. And they all were just doing their thing, running sandwich shops and worrying about teenager stuff like detention and homecoming dances while Peter Parker was trying to save the world from an actual legit scary baddie in the form of my favorite Batman, Michael Keaton.\n\nAs for the complaint that Hollywood is fixated on casting black and biracial women as love interests in genre films and TV for white male heroes, so what? Who does this hurt? No one. For contrast, I sat through all of Jessica Jones, with skinny, white-ass Krysten Ritter, on Netflix, where she boned super black man Luke Cage (Mike Colter) six ways to Sunday and gave all of no shits. I mean, would I have preferred to see black love? Sure, I love black love! But then Marvel made a whole Luke Cage TV show and stuck Misty Knight (Simone Missick) and Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) in it, and I forgot Jessica Jones even happened!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the alternative is no black women in the movie at all, I choose \u201cStick some black women in it\u201d every time. Yeah, is it so common now that it\u2019s clich\u00e9? ROTFLMAO; of course it is! Is it true that racist nerds are more comfortable with Sue Storm being played by a Latino woman in a blond wig than Johnny Storm being played by a black guy in the form of Michael B. Jordan? Of course it is.\n\nDoes that mean Jessica Alba should turn down roles because shit\u2019s not fair? Of course not; that\u2019s crazy talk! The push should be for black characters and Latino characters and Asian characters to get to be well-rounded, fully fleshed-out characters, not that they shouldn\u2019t be there at all.\n\nNow, if the beef is that this isn\u2019t a Miles Morales Spider-Man movie\u2014Miles Morales being the awesome Afro-Latino Spider-Man in the comics\u2014I mean, sure, that would be a fun movie, too, but I talked to my younger sister, whose complete knowledge of Marvel movies begins with Iron Man and ends with her 5-year-old\u2019s love of Captain America, and she was like, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey don\u2019t make these movies just for me and you, Jason. They make them for the vast majority of America who is my sister, who is like, \u201cWho?\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean there will never, ever be a Miles Morales Spider-Man movie. They stuck a great Miles Morales Easter egg in the form of Donald Glover right smack dab in the middle of the movie for fans. It went over my sister\u2019s head, but I got it and loved it!\n\nIf the beef is, \u201cWell, it\u2019s yet another superhero movie with a white guy in it,\u201d I don\u2019t even know what to say. Should Marvel have not even bothered to cast all those black and brown people? Should we go back to the 2002 New York of Tobey Maguire Spider-Man, where one of the few people of color was Octavia Spencer\u2014who I forgot was even in the movie\u2014and her all five seconds of screen time? Could Marvel do more? Could Marvel do better? Of course it can! That\u2019s why Black Panther is coming to a theater near you in February 2018!\n\nThat said, despite your very wrong and not right Spider-Man opinions, I still love you like my very wrong play cousin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour editor", "keywords": ["spiderman", "oh", "cmon", "marvel", "love", "movie", "characters", "women", "black", "ned", "diversity", "homecoming", "white", "played", "jason", "counterpoint", "great"], "polarity": 0.10849608624788487, "subjectivity": 0.47898185347825595},

When the press and public demand that the president address issues that he clearly doesn\u2019t care about, it only makes the problem worse\u2014like a teacher squeezing an insincere apology out of a bully who\u2019s just going to hit you again the moment she leaves the room.\n\nTrump spoke Thursday about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["republicans", "school", "cares", "took", "shootings", "president", "thats", "trump", "dont", "health", "speech", "shooting", "mental", "listened", "pretend"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

Last year the Hollywood Reporter named him to its list of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment. Sorkin is the acclaimed television writer who makes the movies and TV shows that feature white people walking really fast and talking really fast at the same time, like The West Wing and HBO\u2019s The Newsroom. He also wrote the movies A Few Good Men, The Social Network, Steve Jobs and\u2014you know what? Now that I think about it, none of those movies or TV shows had a black lead character, so maybe you don\u2019t know Sorkin at all. Just trust me\u2014he\u2019s a very important man.\n\nThis weekend, Sorkin participated in a panel at the Writers Guild Film Festival in Hollywood. Someone asked him about the lack of diversity in television writers\u2019 rooms. Sorkin almost didn\u2019t understand the question, responding, \u201cAre you saying that women and minorities have a more difficult time getting their stuff read than white men, and you\u2019re also saying that [white men] get to make mediocre movies and can continue on?\u201d\n\nAccording to Variety magazine, the renowned screenwriter seemed genuinely shocked to hear this. Sorkin expressed that he genuinely believed that Hollywood was a meritocracy, and had no idea that there was a diversity problem in the entertainment industry. When presented with the idea that minorities must perform at a level higher than that of their white counterparts, he struggled to grasp the concept that minorities in every field have come to accept as a hard truth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that if you are a woman or a person of color, you have to hit it out of the park in order to get another chance?\u201d Sorkin, a well-known liberal who\u2019s not afraid to inject progressive ideas into almost all of his work, went on to add. \u201cWhat can I do [to help]? I do want to understand what someone like me can do \u2026 but my thing has always been: \u2018If you write it, they will come.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds legit ... until you remember that a few years ago, Sorkin was also targeted during the Sony email hack that revealed how he felt actresses aren\u2019t as good as their male counterparts, because their roles aren\u2019t as difficult:\n\nThat\u2019s why year in and year out, the guy who wins the Oscar for Best Actor has a much higher bar to clear than the woman who wins Best Actress. Cate [Blanchett] gave a terrific performance in Blue Jasmine but nothing close to the degree of difficulty for any of the five Best Actor nominees. ... Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep can play with the boys but there just aren\u2019t that many tour-de-force roles out there for women.\n\nWhile this isolated incident may seem like single-day, morning-tabloid fodder, it is indicative of the hurdles that minorities face in every industry. Often, the people who are in charge and might be willing to help live inside a bubble that shields them from awareness of problems like lack of diversity and systemic inequality. It is only when someone speaks out that they even take notice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSorkin\u2019s alleged ignorance shows why people who raise their voices about these issues are important. This incident also highlights how some people\u2014just because they were born Caucasian and male\u2014have the birthright of being able to live their entire lives never having to contemplate the complexity of race, gender and inequality and how it affects them. It is a concrete example of how\u2014whether it is a Hollywood writers\u2019 room or a corporate boardroom\u2014whiteness is an advantage that doesn\u2019t require you to \u201chit it out of the park\u201d every single time. It is a privilege. Someone should coin a phrase for that concept.\n\nNah ...

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["day", "youre", "person", "nra", "trump", "matter", "age", "convention", "gun", "white", "shot", "black", "guns", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

And she is part of what appears to be a national trend: black women arming themselves, determined to not go down\u2014not without a fight.\n\nMore and more black women are taking self-defense seriously\u2014intent on protecting themselves, their property and their loved ones\u2014and as a result, many are turning to firearms as a means to that end.\n\nIn a paper titled \u201cConcealed Carry Permit Holders Across the United States: 2016,\u201d John Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center noted that although whites still hold the majority of permits, the number of black permit holders grew more than twice as quickly as that of whites.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConcealed carry has increased most rapidly among black females,\u201d Lott found. \u201cFrom 2000 to 2015, the rate of growth was 3.81 times faster than among white females.\u201d\n\nThe National African American Gun Association, one of many black gun groups that have grown exponentially over the past few years, is mostly made up of women\u201460 percent of its membership, to be precise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI thought when I initially started the organization that there\u2019d be a lot more black men joining to revisit some of the social obstacles and challenges that we have in terms of firearms, but it\u2019s been black woman that have been driving a lot of our growth, and that\u2019s across the board,\u201d Philip Smith, president of NAAGA, said.\n\n\u201cEvery day, every week, every month, more and more black woman consistently, from a percentage standpoint, join our organization versus black men, and I really think it\u2019s because of some of the issues that black women have to face specifically based on their position in American society,\u201d he added.\n\nCrime in respective communities across the nation is definitely one key factor.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of women are realizing that \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t even go to the gas station without somebody trying to assault me or rob me,\u2019\u201d Nezida Davis, a legal counsel to NAAGA, said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s this rising fear among women because a lot of women are out there, they work, they go to the grocery store, they take their children out and they\u2019re by themselves many times, and they need to find a way to protect themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nHeightened racism and the rise of white nationalism in this political climate certainly haven\u2019t helped, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDuring this American history class there ... was a video [shown] of back in slavery time when the KKK ... would come into homes and kick the doors in and drag out the men, and the women just kind of cower in a corner and cry. ...

Another 2014 survey shows that the mentality of black adults around guns is also evolving, with a whopping 54 percent saying that they believed owning a gun makes people safer, when, just two years earlier, only 29 percent believed that to be true.\n\nHowever, Tigner stresses that guns are a responsibility she takes seriously and that she imposes a heavy dose of respect for the weapon upon her students, letting them know that this is not a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know if I get into an argument with someone, I do have a deadly weapon on me and I could take their life.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

But what they got instead included the series\u2019 creators sticking to the comic and Finn Jones being cast as Rand, a white guy who masters martial arts and becomes better than his Asian counterparts.\n\nAs the series prepares for its premiere, many people have voiced their displeasure with Jones\u2019 casting, but it was Jones who stepped into a conversation about diversity on Twitter, which didn\u2019t go so well for him.\n\nOn Sunday, Jones tweeted Rogue One actor Riz Ahmed\u2019s speech about the importance of diversity and representation in movies:\n\nThe irony was there. And Jones opened himself up to criticism, the bulk of which came from Asyiqin Haron, creative director for Geeks of Color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaron, who has since locked his Twitter account, questioned how Jones could praise representation when he\u2019s playing the role of Rand while knowing that people wanted an Asian actor.\n\nJones responded in what some probably thought was typical white-guy fashion:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter defending his series and receiving backlash from his tweets, Jones deleted his Twitter account. In a statement to Deadline, Jones explained why he decided to take a short break from social media: \u201cI\u2019m currently in the middle of filming and I need to stay focused on bringing to life this character without judgment, so I decided to remove myself from Twitter for the time being.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ctime being\u201d was only a day, and Jones fired up his account again late Monday. He issued a longer statement about his tweets and the series, which premieres March 17:\n\nThere is a huge benefit to engage and help shape conversations on social media, especially when it comes to giving a voice to social matters. My original intention was to amplify a speech made by Riz Ahmed at the House of Commons. It was a very articulate and important speech on representation that I wholly agreed with. After posting I was inundated by people accusing me of not being allowed to share his voice based on an assumption that our show is going to play into the problems of racial inequality on screen. I engaged politely, diplomatically and attempted to bridge the divide. I\u2019m currently in the middle of filming and I need to stay focused on bringing to life this character without judgment, so I decided to remove myself from twitter for the time being.I am very proud of the work everyone has done on this series and I\u2019m excited for people to see how we\u2019ve adapted the story. We have gone to great lengths to represent a diverse cast with an intelligent, socially progressive storyline. I hope people can watch the show before making judgments. In times, as divisive as these, we need to stay unified, compassionate and understanding in our differences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, as a fan of the comic, I can\u2019t really say I expected Netflix to cast an Asian actor as Rand, and it would have made for a totally different storyline. Of course, Jones is going to defend his series, but he may want to realize that representation is more than having Asian actors on the series in a secondary role.\n\nAnd just in case you want to connect with your chi, Jones has a recommendation:", "keywords": ["fist", "representation", "rand", "explains", "twitter", "social", "stay", "debate", "series", "diversity", "asian", "cast", "speech", "actor", "iron", "jones", "deleted"], "polarity": 0.16196581196581197, "subjectivity": 0.4132478632478633},

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["day", "youre", "person", "nra", "trump", "matter", "age", "convention", "gun", "white", "shot", "black", "guns", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

She\u2019s able to see me. We love each other. The love has grown. That stuff is minutiae. It\u2019s not that important.\u201d\n\nThe biggest surprise of the night came when Denzel Washington won his first SAG Award for best actor for his role in Fences. Many people, including Washington, thought the award was going to Casey Affleck, and his speech reflected that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know, I am a God-fearing man. I\u2019m supposed to have faith, but I didn\u2019t have faith. God bless you all, all the other actors.

But I am prepared!\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s co-star in Fences, Viola Davis, made history when she became the first black woman to win five SAG Awards. Davis won in the best supporting actress in a motion picture category. Davis used her speech to thank Fences\u2019 playwright, August Wilson.\n\n\u201cWhat August did so beautifully is he honored the average man, who happened to be a man of color,\u201d she said at the podium. \u201cAnd sometimes we don\u2019t have to shake the world and move the world and create anything that is going to be in the history book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that we breathed and lived a life and was a god to our children, just that, means that we have a story and it deserves to be told,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe deserve to be in the canon of any\u2014in the center of any narrative that\u2019s written out there. And that\u2019s what August did. He elevated my father, my mother, my uncles who had eighth- and fifth-grade educations, and he just encapsulated them in history.\u201d\n\nThe final award of the night went to the cast of Hidden Figures, who also used the opportunity to speak about love prevailing, when they won for best movie ensemble.\n\n\n\nTaraji P. Henson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Octavia Spencer accepted the award, and Henson reminded people what happens when you come together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis story is about unity,\u201d Henson said. \u201cThis story is about what happens when we put our differences aside and we come together as a human race. We win. Love wins. Every time.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the awards show, the most poignant afterthoughts came from Davis when she spoke about inclusion and #OscarsSoWhite. According to Davis, she doesn\u2019t think that was the reason black people took home awards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of typecasting\u2014age, sex, color, dark-skinned, light-skinned,\u201d said Davis. \u201cResponse to OscarsSoWhite? No. I think that every nominee, from Naomie Harris to Octavia Spencer to Hidden Figures to Fences to Moonlight to Mahershala Ali, are up there because they deserve to be there. They\u2019re not there because of the color of their skin. They put in the work. So the answer to that is no.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis also spoke about next month\u2019s Oscar and the \u201ctrend\u201d of diversity and inclusion.\n\n\u201cFeb. 27 is gonna come, and now what?\u201d Davis said. \u201cIs it just going to be a trend to talk about inclusion\u2014and I\u2019d rather say \u2018inclusion\u2019 than \u2018diversity\u2019\u2014or is it going to be a norm that we\u2019re all part of the narrative, that all of our stories deserve to be told, and that art indeed has to reflect life and our culture?

Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics.

For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A \u2018gun free\u2019 school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on: \u201cIf a potential \u2018sicko shooter\u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you ever want to know where Trump or the rest of the GOP Unsullied (minus the honor, black skin and fighting abilities) stand on issues relating to gun violence or gun safety, just check with the NRA first, because that\u2019s what they do.", "keywords": ["savage", "teachers", "school", "carrying", "nra", "backtracking", "president", "sicko", "trump", "gun", "guns", "objectives", "great", "cant"], "polarity": 0.11611540111540113, "subjectivity": 0.5350782925782926},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["organization", "terrorist", "nra", "right", "directly", "nras", "second", "dont", "gun", "legal", "deaths"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space.

You have been warned. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, get your life.\n\n1. It was fun watching the postshow special and trying to see myself in the crowd (I didn\u2019t, but I also didn\u2019t watch the whole thing\u2014had to get the babies to sleep and whatnot). The experience of being there and watching the sausage get made was a first for me and highly entertaining, but also I never realized just how scripted those things are to minimize hiccups.\n\nAlso, Oprah just be out there walking around like she don\u2019t own everything we all touched, like she all normal, like it wasn\u2019t her floor. I walked on Oprah\u2019s floor. It\u2019s got to be crazy to be like, \u201cAll this is mine.\u201d I get excited about the plastic cups I own and look at folks crazy for what looks like scheming on them. Neither here nor there, but I just wanted to talk about how awesome the entire experience of being there at OWN was.\n\nOff to the show ...\n\n2. Kofi Siriboe\u2019s ugly-cry game is on a hundred thousand trillion. Listen, over the past, say, four episodes, Siriboe\u2019s acting game has been like, \u201cNothing can stop me\u2014I\u2019m all the way up.\u201d He\u2019s nailed the proper emotion on all of those scenes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last scene when he\u2019s talking to Blue about his name and all that, man, or the opening scene in the last episode where he tells Hollywood to gather the family because he can only say what he has to say once. Or the scene where he and Darla are at the pool. Good gracious. He went for it. She did, too, but he really did. Somebody get that man an award for reaching emotional depths that I\u2019m sure even surprised him. At the very least for taking the art of the ugly cry to new heights. Sheesh. I couldn\u2019t even tell if his eyes were open half the time. That\u2019s talent.\n\n3. Tell me you weren\u2019t afraid something bad happened to Darla. That she was gonna get into a car accident? Or overdose on drugs? Or ANYTHING. Ralph Angel trying to find her was love. He got over himself to be concerned for her safety. He can\u2019t trust her, but that\u2019s Blue\u2019s mama and, even if they can\u2019t be together, the woman he loves.\n\n4. Darla just gon\u2019 up and bounce on Blue without saying bye? Yo no comprende. Where dey do dat at? How, Sway? I want Darla to win so badly because I like her and Ralph Angel together. And I believe they will get it together. I\u2019m not even mad that Blue might not be Ra\u2019s son, but like Ra said, \u201cYou say, \u2018I\u2019m pregnant; it might not be yours.\u2019\u201d Blue is the most important thing to that man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Which is why \u201cBlue is the blood in my veins, even if mine ain\u2019t in his\u201d took me all the way out of there. While there were a few scenes in the finale that seemed a little forced (only a few), they are all forgotten with lines like that. It\u2019s so deep and let Darla (and us) know that Ralph Angel would never stop being that boy\u2019s daddy. I didn\u2019t doubt it, but still ... Mama, there goes that man.\n\n6. I don\u2019t blame Remy for bouncing on Charley. She\u2019s too good at \u201cthe game.\u201d I don\u2019t even know what \u201cthe game\u201d is, but she\u2019s about that shit. Like she said, she\u2019s fueled by negativity (paraphrasing) and I think Remy realized that for Charley, winning her way is more important than the costs. Even when she basically said as much to White Man Boudreau (his name escapes me\u2014you know the one, the one who\u2019s intoxicated by her), I wondered if it was performance or real. I don\u2019t trust Charley, and Remy came to that same conclusion even if he hates it.\n\n7. Can we talk about the music of Queen Sugar for a minute? My Shazam button worked overtime during the course of this show. On last week\u2019s episode, I was introduced to Ngaiire\u2019s song \u201cFall Into My Arms,\u201d which has been on REPEAT (you hear me?) ever since. Good lord, that song speaks to my soul, and its placement was SO perfect. I was introduced to the Francis and the Lights song \u201cMy City Is Gone\u201d (featuring Kanye West) on last night\u2019s finale like, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe whole season has been like that. At this point, I want a one-hour special on the music of Queen Sugar. I\u2019d even host it. You hear that, Oprah?! Let me host it! (We call that \u201cshooting your shot.\u201d) All jokes aside, I\u2019d love to watch that special because the music is as much another character as the land.\n\n8. Y\u2019all, Oprah called herself \u201cthe land\u201d when asked how she might view herself as a character of the show. Game. Set. Match. If LeBron and Oprah don\u2019t do something where they both call themselves \u201cthe Land,\u201d I\u2019ll be disappointed.\n\n9. I love how Queen Sugar has had entirely female directors for the entirety of its existence. The vignette during the postshow where they discussed that made my heart smile. Opportunities in that industry seem to come few and far between unless they\u2019re specifically created, so shouts out to Ava DuVernay for being a creator. And to Oprah because Oprah. You know, the land and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I want to say how much I appreciate this show. So many facets of life, black life specifically, have been addressed with care and nuance that there really is no other show on television like it, nor has there been. That speaks to quality casting and people respecting the material. It also comes from having the ability to be fully black with the work and not have to worry about other folks not getting it or appreciating it.\n\nThe show includes both timely references and current events in a way that is realistic and necessary. Obviously I\u2019m a fan of the show and the actors and the creators, but ultimately I appreciate black art\u2014especially the kind we can all be proud of while participating. Queen Sugar is one of those shows for me, and thank goodness we\u2019re getting more seasons.", "keywords": ["sugar", "know", "nights", "finale", "oprah", "say", "blue", "darla", "game", "dont", "season", "way", "thoughts", "queen"], "polarity": 0.0889686147186147, "subjectivity": 0.5113444216602112},
{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/hey-y-all-i-met-oprah-here-s-what-happened-1820294380", "title": "/hey-y-all-i-met-oprah-here-s-what-happened-", "text": "A little backstory on how we got to the point where this is even a thing: On Nov. 17, 2016, I wrote a piece called \u201cQueen Sugar Hits This Dad Right in the Feels.\u201d By the end of that day, life was different; anything was possible. The piece published first thing in the morning that day. By 2 p.m., I received a call from Oprah Winfrey\u2014you\u2019ve probably heard of her\u2014telling me that she\u2019d read and loved the piece and even teared up reading about my reaction to the scene at the heart of the article. I documented that experience here.\n\nListen, life is different once stuff like that happens to you. It just is. Especially because those are the types of experiences you get to share with people. I didn\u2019t answer the call because of the \u201cUnknown\u201d caller-ID tag, and it allowed me to have a voicemail that I can still play for folks. Oprah called me, but she really called everybody I know that day.\n\nI have played that voicemail for classes of students. I\u2019ve played it for people I see on the street who recognize me and ask me to hear it. That was a win for everybody who tries to do anything creative and wonders if anybody notices. Turns out, yes, people can and do notice. And sometimes people is even Oprah.\n\nIn April of this year, the HBO original movie The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks starring Oprah Winfrey was released. I had the fortune of attending a screening at the Blacksonian, and Oprah was there. I got really close to her, too\u2014close enough to try to stop her and tell her that she called me and take a picture with her, but it didn\u2019t seem like the right time to do that, so I let it ride. I figured, life has been semicharmed to this point, and God seems to be looking out more than I might deserve\u2014I\u2019ll probably see her again and get a chance to tell her and take a picture with her. Oh, what a friend we have in Jesus.\n\nQueen Sugar was then and remains one of my favorite shows, so on occasion I write about it. I recently wrote about how Queen Sugar was coming for all of the feelings that This Is Us typically draws out of me. The piece published in the morning, and in the afternoon I got an email from OWN saying that they loved the piece and oh, by the way, they\u2019re taping a season-finale postshow discussion in Hollywood on Nov. 7 moderated by Oprah featuring Ava DuVernay and the cast, and would I like to come because they\u2019ll cover everything?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruh. Here\u2019s where the shit gets beautiful. Damon and I were already going to be in the Bay Area for a speaking engagement at Stanford University on Nov. 6. It\u2019s a quick flight to Los Angeles for Nov. 7! Perfecto. Siiiiiiign me up. The postshow taping was great, and the OWN building is awesome. I love L.A., and I love being on studio lots. It feels so Hollywood and I love everything about it. We got to see how the sausage gets made, and the convo was cute and fun. Oprah said one thing that had the entire audience\u2019s mind blown\u2014check that out on Nov. 15 after the season finale.\n\nWhere the fun happens is the postshow after-party, which was at Soho House. I\u2019m guessing this is an exclusive-ass place because just to get to the \u201cgarden,\u201d we had to walk through a long hallway that looked like some Prohibition-era get-to-the-booze-and-gambling entryway. Shit was glamorous, b. I felt glamorous. Me and you, your mama and your cousin, too, felt glamorous.\n\nWe (les journos) got there first, which gave us the opportunity to take a bunch of pictures of places famous folks hang. I think the first celeb from Queen Sugar to show up was Bianca Lawson (Darla), and she started taking pictures with folks immediately. She was very sweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one thing I\u2019ll say about the cast members that we met\u2014everybody was super cool, willing to talk to you and mad down to earth. It\u2019s always amazing to me how small folks are in real life compared with how they look on camera. Rutina Wesley (Nova) is an itty-bitty thang. She\u2019s adorbs. Also, Kofi Siriboe is a good-looking man. Like, I\u2019m not sure how else to say that. He just is a good-looking dude. Even in the picture I took with him, I was like, \u201cWell, this is the picture NOBODY will care that I\u2019m in.\u201d He laughed.\n\nI also talked to his mother for a bit, seeing as she\u2019s Ghanaian and my woman is Ghanaian, and I have a son also called Kofi (one of his middle names, anyway). She\u2019s a super-sweet woman, and she had such a great spirit and vibe. I love black mamas.\n\nOf course, when Oprah walks into the room, she has this gravity about her. She comes in just as cool as a cucumber and starts talking to people. Now, when you\u2019re LOOKING to meet and talk to somebody, especially not quite as famous as Jesus but, like, No. 4 or 5 on that list, you try to figure out the approach. Me? I had nothing. I don\u2019t think any of us did, honestly. Then she went to the one place where I\u2019m always at home and can find a reason to talk to anybody: the bar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd NOBODY was standing next to her on her right. Like, there goes Oprah just being Oprah and her whole right side is free? So I did what any self-respecting person would do ... I sidled up to her and prepared to launch into a \u201cHey, I noticed you noticing me, and I wanted to put you on notice that I noticed you, too.\u201d Then I realized that she was ordering a drink, and my soul was like, \u201cDog, you HAVE to know what Oprah is drinking.\u201d So I just asked, \u201cAnd what exactly are YOU drinking?\u201d\n\nDo you know this turned into an entire convo about tequila? Oprah is a tequila drinker. We had an entire convo about her palate for tequila and how she has a favorite, Casa Dragones, and how she\u2019s traveled the world in search of just the right taste for her. She told us how smooth it is and mentioned George Clooney\u2019s tequila. I had just ordered my standard Bulleit and ginger ale (all drinks were free, bee tee dubs) so I just tasted it while everyone else ordered what she was having. Oprah then proceeded to toast with us all, because Oprah apparently is about that celebrating-life life.\n\nBut because she\u2019s Oprah, she ALSO proceeded to listen to us talk about finding passion in life and doing what you love. She actually had real inspirational conversations with my fellow journos about them deciding to write and be creatives for a living and how God puts those options in your life or puts the word there until you can\u2019t deny it. That woman spoke of how you have to follow your heart\u2014you know, the kind of stuff we all need to hear, but it carries weight coming from somebody who made it to the top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI stepped in and asked for a picture with her. Before we took the picture, I told her that I was Panama Jackson from VSB and that she called and left me a voicemail after I wrote an article about the show and how I sent it to all my family and friends and how it lit up so many folks\u2019 day and we were so excited and thankful for that and that she\u2019s awesome. And she looked me dead in my face and said: \u201cTHAT WAS YOU! It was such a good piece, and I loved the way you captured exactly what we were trying to convey. Thank you so much! It was such a good and well-written piece!\u201d\n\nThen she high-fived me and pulled me in for a picture, and I\u2019m pretty sure my heart sang a song of sixpence. My face touched her face, and then I smiled the biggest smile ever as the camera snapped. She was so nice about it and so pleasant and sweet. Oprah invited me (sure, it was folks from OWN, but she owns OWN, so I\u2019m looking at it like Oprah invited me, dammit) to hang out with her and Ava and the cast of Queen Sugar, and told me she remembered the piece I wrote and toasted with the homies all of the free drinks we could drink. I got to say, that day was a good day. She was handing out hugs, words, tequila and good vibes. She\u2019s good with me, b. Always.\n\nEvents like this and being invited to go to stuff like this with famous people who are paying attention to what we\u2019re doing is humbling and still inspires me at times. There\u2019s nothing like being yourself and finding out that other people can appreciate it. Some of those people can change everything for you or give you enough of an energy boost to keep going. Again, you never know who that will be.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all of you folks who are out there trying to find your next idea or creative endeavor, please, please, please keep on keeping on. You really have no idea where any of this can take you. Everybody ain\u2019t gonna get to the top\u2014this is fact. But why can\u2019t that person who does make it be you? Never forget that. Seriously.\n\nEnjoy the ride and realize that inspiration and success\u2014whatever that looks like for you\u2014don\u2019t have to miss you. Figure out what your success is, and then prepare for your actual success to look way different than you thought. Just don\u2019t stop, fam. At all. Oprah (or whoever matters to you) might be paying attention.\n\nOne last thing: We met Oprah, y\u2019all. Because without VSB and the folks who come here and read and keep us inspired, I\u2019d never be in the position to write about something I enjoy that could end up in front of Oprah. From my mind to Oprah\u2019s eyes has been a long journey, but I\u2019m glad I got to take it.

Not only did Donald Trump become president, but he went about shoring up white supremacy as swiftly as possible.\n\nUnder his leadership, hate groups have grown and protections for marginalized people have been eagerly dismantled by the administration. And people of color, women and anyone who can be identified as \u201cother\u201d on a census form became even more obvious targets of overt prejudice, racist violence and blatant sexism.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. A February American Psychological Association poll found that 57 percent of Americans feel \u201csignificant stress\u201d thanks to today\u2019s political climate. We\u2019re also more anxious, more restless and extra sensitive in familiar surroundings. It\u2019s like we\u2019re drifting away on a wave of sadness.\n\nBut there might be an antidote to this languishing emotional recession.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that supporting and encouraging women of color to start their own businesses can give all of us a jolt of new energy and help us slow the descent into the psychological black hole that is the Trump presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay with me.\n\nWe need women of color to start their own businesses\u2014en masse\u2014for a few reasons. First, the rest of us can go work for them! (Explaining why that would be beneficial requires its own article.) The rest of us can support their creativity while experiencing what it\u2019s like to be valued and respected. We\u2019d also get a collective break from white supremacy at work (pun intended).\n\nAnd right now, we need a break.\n\nIn 2017 we\u2019re going to therapy more, with online therapy company TalkSpace reporting a jump in new patients this year, especially among people targeted by Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric. We\u2019re also self-medicating more, as evidenced by the spike in drinking among women of color and other groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s also face the fact that under Trump, women of color probably encounter even greater obstacles in getting promoted and earning what they\u2019re worth in traditional work environments. Trump governs by toxic masculinity and white supremacy. And he is taking a sledgehammer to opportunity and protective programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Title IX and Obama-era measures that would require companies to disclose how much they pay workers in order to address the gender pay gap.\n\nAccording to the research group Catalyst, women of color often lack the support (pdf) needed to move up the ranks in their workplace. They also face challenges for \u201csticking out\u201d and in trying to \u201cblend in.\u201d The report concluded that \u201c[b]ecause corporate environments typically do not reflect the behavioral norms common to the cultural backgrounds of women of color, these women may have to go to great lengths to adjust to the corporate environment and to network effectively.\u201d\n\nSo the rest of us have to step up and support women of color so that they can work in environments that utilize skills, perspectives and experiences that are not always fully expressed or nurtured in white-dominant workplaces. Two words: Ava DuVernay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe visionary filmmaker recently explained that instead of trying to break the glass ceiling, she is focused on \u201cbuilding my own house.\u201d\n\nWe need more Ava DuVernays. And Shonda Rhimeses. And Issa Raes. And Maria Hinojosas. But the rest of us have to put in work so that these gifted women among us can start their own enterprises\u2014to maximize and monetize their talents and possibilities\u2014and set the country on a better path as we prepare to become a majority-minority country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, women of color have already mastered so many of the requisite skills. From their work leading extended intergenerational families to organizing PTAs and church groups and running informal beauty and catering businesses from home, women of color have the human resources acumen to run successful enterprises and to empower employees to do their best work. They delegate, supervise and orchestrate major events like weddings, annual family gatherings, quincea\u00f1eras and large Greek-life gatherings.\n\nFrom these private and public experiences, women of color also emerge with a hard-won emotional intelligence, which a recent study shows is already more abundant in women. Experience shows that women of color have borne the burden of being de facto social workers, group therapists and conflict mitigators at work and school whenever racial tensions and intersectional misunderstandings flare up.

It\u2019s easily one of the most compelling shows on television, and probably the only justification for why I see Farmers Only commercials on black television networks.\n\nI won\u2019t call it the best show on television, since I\u2019ve seen exactly half of one episode of Game of Thrones and people have GoT watch parties and there are meme generators dedicated to it. People seem to feel really strongly about GoT.\n\n\n\nPoint is, it\u2019s a great show, but I won\u2019t fight about what show is the best on television, since I\u2019m not up on all of the most popular shows.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand (Queen Sugar): For years a common complaint in the black community was that we lacked diversity in the form of television shows that catered to the black experience; Queen Sugar looks that complaint right in the face and slaps the taste out of its mouth. It\u2019s a good show, y\u2019all, and I\u2019m gonna learn you something today in case you ain\u2019t up on game. Here are 10 reasons you should absolutely be watching Queen Sugar right now.\n\n1. In what seemed like a herculean feat, the show leveled up in its currently running second season (we just reached that annoying midseason finale point last night) of life with the Bordelon family. For those not in the know, we\u2019re taking a look at the Bordelons, a complex family unit where the patriarch\u2019s death leads to the eventual (I\u2019m skipping everything) opening of the Queen Sugar Mill, whose express purpose is seeing to the needs of black farmers in fictional St. Josephine, La. My concern after season 1 was that they might have given it everything they had. I was wrong. I apologize\u2014believe me, I do. I shan\u2019t worry any longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. There are three Bordelon kids: Nova is the oldest, Charley is the love child in the middle, and Ralph Angel is the youngest and only boy. You could NOT come up with three more different siblings. Nova is basically Black Lives Matter in the flesh, except our first foray into her life includes her relationship with a married white police officer. Say heifer, say what? Yeah, girl, you heard me right!\n\nCharley is the wife of an NBA All-Star and champion and is the brains behind their whole family operation until it all goes to the left, to the left. Then there\u2019s Ralph Angel, a walking, talking good intention who is trying to get his life together after a stint in jail.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: He\u2019s got a son named Blue (more on him later) with a former addict, Darla. Somehow HE\u2019S the stable one in that parental construct and has \u201ccustody\u201d of their son. Bruh. What? Why does this rate as a reason you should watch? Here\u2019s why: In three siblings, we literally hit so many cross sections of the black community. We\u2019ve got a basketball wife (no tomfoolery, though), an activist with some inconsistencies and a reformed felon ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... and there\u2019s a farm involved.\n\n3. Charley is probably the most curious character on the show even though I enjoy her the least. She\u2019s a woman who is in total control\u2014if you let the liquor tell it\u2014whose world was upended by her philandering soon-to-be ex-husband (the NBA star), Davis, and it sends her into a personal fact-finding mission where she becomes, effectively, Queen Sugar.\n\nCharley is on her shit, full stop, in almost every way. She\u2019s always a step ahead and always handling business. Until we start to see the chinks in her armor in the second season and she becomes more human\u2014to me at least. Who she really is starts to unfold, and it\u2019s powerful. The last two episodes ... actually, we\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I want Ralph Angel to win because as a character, he\u2019s so interesting. He\u2019s got a lot of pride, and it all makes sense. He\u2019s doing everything he can to be a better man and be the best man he can for his son, Blue. The introduction of Blue\u2019s black Barbie doll, Kenya, adds additional layers to who Ralph Angel is, since he is fiercely protective of his son\u2019s innocence and kinship with this doll.\n\nWe come to find out that Ralph Angel has long been accepting and understanding as a man and is not confined by gender roles or norms. Talk about curveballs. This show has them. What makes that awesome is that the show does not make a huge thing about Kenya, though it\u2019s clearly coming. Kenya ain\u2019t got no lines, but she\u2019s getting more screen time as the show progresses. Point is, on a black television show about black farmers, we have a young boy named Blue who is playing with Barbie dolls and his masculine-as-hell ex-con father is entirely accepting and supportive of him. Where dey do dat at?\n\n5. Can we talk about the music for a minute? I think we can. The music supervisors on this show are TRYING to make you kill your phone\u2019s battery as you set your Shazam to \u201cauto\u201d so it can catch every song. I have actually stood up and clapped at the television screen several times every episode once because of the music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Charley and Davis have a son named Micah who got swept up into their shenanigans, got uprooted from Los Angeles to St. Josephine and has been having a time of it. Well, in this second season, they pulled national storylines into the show regarding police brutality. I won\u2019t give anything away, but last night\u2019s midseason finale\u2014GOOD LORD, I ALMOST LOST ALL OF MY MARBLES.\n\nA running storyline is finding out what happened to Micah when the police took him to jail for driving while black. Last night we found out, and man ... I have no idea how I\u2019d handle that if my son were relaying the story they had him tell. It reminded me of the movie Daddy\u2019s Little Girls when Idris\u2019 character\u2019s daughters show up at 2 a.m. and he finds out that his ex-wife\u2019s new boyfriend put his hands on them. He felt helpless (because felon), and that\u2019s a fear I have: something happening to my children where I feel helpless about my ability to fix it and take away the pain. Those scenes make me boo-hoo, and I don\u2019t care who is watching. It was the one moment on the show where I\u2019ve felt bad for Davis.\n\n7. The last two episodes of this season so far have been some of the most emotionally draining of any show I\u2019ve watched in a while. Now, they aren\u2019t This Is Us-level emo\u2014I don\u2019t think I could handle that\u2014but the family gets upended by some news that sends each of the siblings down different paths as they try to put the pieces of the family together. I\u2019m not saying jump right into those episodes. I am saying that if you want to see some compelling storytelling, the last two episodes are your huckleberry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Aunt Violet is probably the true heart and soul of the show. She\u2019s the glue. Aunt Vi keeps the peace and is the one they all rely on. I love me some Aunt Vi. You will, too, if you don\u2019t already. She\u2019s one of those role players who do their job and do it well, and you\u2019re happy they\u2019re present at all times.\n\n9. Hollywood. I just like Hollywood. He and Aunt Vi really love each other, and he made some BIG mistakes, but when she thought he died and he hadn\u2019t died, lawd\u2014those emotions were real as I sat on my bouch and cried for their love. I just like Hollywood, man. He\u2019s good for Vi and she\u2019s good for him. Surprisingly, he\u2019s from Atlanta. He\u2019s probably got the closest to an accent you\u2019d expect from down there, since nobody else is even really trying. Except Ralph Angel, bless his heart.\n\n10.

Fannie Haughton\u2014a name unfamiliar to most\u2014was living in Oakland, California, under a poisonous Reagan regime, in the middle of a drug war. Much of her life as a student activist had involved working with her mentor, Angela Davis. Haughton taught and organized locally, a communal duty that included helping take over the Black Panthers\u2019 Free Breakfast program for school kids in 1970, after Davis was detained (and later acquitted) for conspiracy charges. Oakland was home to Haughton then. But it was in Grenada, during the People\u2019s Revolution, that she and other black Americans saw a free society and opportunity beyond what they felt America could provide. Haughton believed in the idea of Grenada as a social utopia. So in 1983, she packed up and moved there with her two kids.\n\nThe House On Coco Road serves as Haughton\u2019s personal migration story, as witnessed by her son, filmmaker Damani Baker. The documentary doubles as a family heirloom and historical artifact of his mother\u2019s unrecognized acts of resistance. In Grenada, Haughton found solace in paradise, and then found herself amid warfare when Reagan\u2019s administration, viewing Grenada as a communist accomplice to Cuba and the Soviet Union, ordered a U.S. military invasion of the island. Coco Road\u2014which hits Netflix on June 30 via Ava DuVernay\u2019s distribution company, Array\u2014brings familial and emotional context to the complicated story of Grenada, through interviews with Haughton and the other black women who fought with her.\n\nPreviously, Haughton\u2019s activism and life in Grenada was known mostly to her family. Baker\u2019s purpose is to present a stark opposition to American history and certify his mother\u2019s place in it. \u201cThe history books don\u2019t acknowledge a long list of frontline change-makers that were doing very simple things that have had profound impact on all of us,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThat kind of genius is so important and so fascinating.\u201d Here\u2019s my lightly edited conversation with Baker about his mother the activist and what his film means.\n\nJEZEBEL: The House On Coco Road is mainly a story about your mother and the impact one woman can have on a country in a way that\u2019s not widely recognized. But to me, it\u2019s also meant to show the ways black people matter to this country. What was the bigger picture in your mind through the process of making it?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDAMANI BAKER: It is exactly that. There are stories that we don\u2019t know, and there are activists and leadership that doesn\u2019t fall under what we understand as traditional leadership\u2014people and voices that have collectively shaped the planet. They\u2019ve literally given their lives to imagining a more equitable and sustainable existence for themselves and their families. So I thought it would be interesting to explore that from my family\u2019s experience, and my mom\u2019s. No one knows my mom\u2019s name. She\u2019s not as famous as Fannie Lou Hamer or Angela Davis or Cicely Tyson or other brilliant storytellers. But her actions\u2014as simple as they were\u2014were life-changing and not only moved things along for us and our immediate family, but for people around us, which then moved it along for people around them.\n\nThis idea that there is an alternative version of not only history, but an alternative version to how we can live\u2014that was fascinating to me. The Grenada experience was the perfect model to explore that. I\u2019m originally from Oakland, California, born and raised, and my mom decides to move us to join the Grenada Revolution. I was nine years old living in the Caribbean. I saw nothing wrong with healthcare and education being accessible. I saw nothing particularly strange about women being in positions of power. I really wanted to make something that offered all those things so people could watch it and go, oh man, there are other ways.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film is very much a history lesson, but a different side than what\u2019s told to us. When you speak to your grandmother Victoria, she talks about the system of sharecropping as an extension of slavery. Can you give a sense of the historical context of Coco Road itself?\n\nCoco Road was named after my great-grandmother, so that area in Louisiana was family land, and most of my family lived there. Some migrated West and some are still there. I think this idea of home and what that looks like and what stories are born out of your family\u2019s story and life experience is just as relevant then as it is now. You see in the film that Coco Road now takes on a different meaning.\n\nIt\u2019s known as Cancer Alley.\n\nCancer Alley. It\u2019s still a relevant piece of my family\u2019s story in that a lot of people have suffered and are no longer with us because of the cancer rate in the area. So this idea of home continued to come up in the film. That\u2019s why it\u2019s kinda full circle. You start off in understanding Coco Road as an anchor in our migration. And as [Angela Davis\u2019s sister] Fania Davis says in the film, migration is not just a physical thing. You can have a migration of the mind and the heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, I love the idea of migration being metaphysical. I think the idea of looking for a better life or a better home has been more associated with immigrants to America. My family immigrated here from Guyana in the \u201980s. I was born in Guyana and came here when I was around one. Obviously, black Americans have the Great Migration. Your family moved from Louisiana to Oakland and then from Oakland to Grenada. Did you think about the connection between those different types of migration?\n\nRight, because you think of how we are constantly reinventing ourselves based on whatever may be oppressing us or suppressing us. You look at this debate right now on immigration, which is ridiculous\u2014I think the Southern migration was also a refugee situation. We\u2019re talking about conditions that were destructive, that were violent, that tried to destroy people. It\u2019s not that the systemic racism and oppression changed once my family got to California. They just had to change the tools they needed to process the next level\u2014my family being the only black family on their block in Los Angeles. It\u2019s like this constant migration and figuring out what you need to survive in a way that\u2019s moving the needs of your family and people forward.\n\nThen the \u201980s come up and Ronald Reagan is president, and Oakland at the time did not feel like a safe place to raise children. So [my mother] was like, We gotta get out of here because this is not sustainable, either. I don\u2019t think she was necessarily running away from something. I think she was just looking for the next place that she felt safe and valued as a human being. In that way, it is a really important observation to think of the migration that happens from a place that\u2019s internal and personal. Then we get to Grenada and have a forced migration because the U.S. invaded it with thousands of marines, and that kind of broke the path. I was nine years old coming back to Oakland and had to process my own migration as a child, out of a war situation and back into fifth grade and hearing children, my peers, talk about war and violence in this glorified, celebratory tone. It was so troubling and crazy to me that I had to say, \u201cThis is not the truth.\u201d We\u2019re being fed lies that are so destructive and painful because people died over there. Celebrating Rambo and G.I. Joe and a culture of violence seemed nonsensical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour mother and the people with her believed in Grenada as a utopia, which is a perspective that\u2019s not really seen, compared to the Grenada as Communist story. The film seems like a way to reclaim our place in history, black women especially. Like, when she visits Cuba and says, \u201cWe were never taught that there were black people in Cuba.\u201d Or when she\u2019s like, \u201cThe Grenada I knew didn\u2019t exist anywhere.\u201d\n\nIf you think about this period in history, from 1965 or so to 1973, when I was born, if you could actually just fathom all of what they were taking on\u2014we\u2019re talking about the Vietnam War, Cointelpro, the birth of the Black Panther party, Angela Davis being on the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted List, the Free Angela Davis Committee and her eventual release, going to Cuba, the Soviet Union and Cold War. I mean, this is unreal. When I put myself in that position, to think from being 17, 18 years old to 24, all of those things happening for her in a very real, personal, intimate way is totally unimaginable. Part of my real passion for telling the story was that I feel like the women from that period, we haven\u2019t heard their version of history. Because there was this hyper-masculinity around a lot of movements. There was the media that was constantly distorting things and not acknowledging the women who were on the forefront, or how people were sensationalized and you were only allowed to have one hero.\n\n\u201cPart of my real passion for telling the story was that I feel like the women from that period, we haven\u2019t heard their version of history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of my drive to tell the story was taking my mother as an example of a very specific moment in history that I feel like she was an equal partner in. \u2019Cause the history books don\u2019t acknowledge a long list of frontline change-makers that were doing very simple things that have had profound impact on all of us. You take the Black Panthers\u2019 Free Breakfast program. My mother stepped in to feed children because that was an immediate need. It wasn\u2019t like an ideology and \u201cI gotta be a Panther now.\u201d That was about young people in the 1960s, early \u201970s, that are half my age now, stepping in and saying, if we don\u2019t feel children they\u2019re gonna go to school hungry, and if they don\u2019t have the capacity to learn, we are not moving ourselves and our people forward and we fall victim to a system that does not value them. That kind of genius is so important and so fascinating. I\u2019m still trying to imagine those simple actions and opportunities in my own day-to-day. It\u2019s a profound cast of people who you just don\u2019t know that are brilliant.\n\nRight, the film goes into depth about your mother\u2019s work in the \u201960s and her relationship with Angela Davis as part of the Black Student Union. It seems like you made a point to show the human, emotional side of activism.\n\nYes, exactly. The two-dimensional storytelling when someone throws their fist in the air is relevant, but they\u2019re also people. There are human beings behind these actions so I really did want to put a face and my mother\u2019s face to issues that were much larger than our family\u2019s. Because as Angela says in the film, the personal is political and they\u2019re all intertwined. The simple actions that she did were political actions, but they were from a personal space. I didn\u2019t understand what was happening in Grenada. I didn\u2019t understand the politics of how things worked and who did what and the trauma that\u2019s still around, the assassination of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop. Those things didn\u2019t necessarily make sense to me then, but what I did see was people who looked like me who were doing incredible things, and that stuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m interested in how you started the conversation with your mom. For children, there\u2019s a point when we realize our parents have a \u201cstory,\u201d but sometimes it\u2019s hard to start that conversation. So there was this really compelling figure in your life, but you didn\u2019t know the full story. How did you approach her about telling it? And why did she ultimately decide to share it?\n\nThat\u2019s such a real question because I\u2019m reminded that this is my mom. [Laughs] It\u2019s not like she wanted me to necessarily go down this path, because it was hard for her. When I started this film, in 1999, I was fresh out of grad school. I knew I wanted to tell this Grenada story. I honestly did not know what shape it would take. But I did have this story of a family moving to Oakland to be part of the Grenada Revolution and then are evacuated by U.S. military invasion. But what I hadn\u2019t really processed was my mother\u2019s own response to that story and her own trauma as a single mom with her kids, to be part of this thing and leave after a coup and invasion. I wasn\u2019t even prepared for what that would produce in her. So our first trip back was very difficult for all of us.\n\nWe were all ready to shoot and, as you see in the first scene of the film, she wasn\u2019t pleased. She was in pain and she was really processing what her son was getting into and did not hold back in articulating that. So I was nervous. I was like, oh my God, I brought my mom back to this place and how am I gonna start this long journey with someone who I hadn\u2019t really taken a lot of time to have casual family conversations about what had happened. And now all of a sudden, we\u2019re here with a crew and a camera. That early 1999 shoot, was the beginning of a very long both creative process and also family healing process. It was [about] opening my journal with her whenever she was willing. It\u2019s a mother and son in conversation over 15 years. It\u2019s priceless and valuable and a document and testament to her willingness to participate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love the part of the narration where you say, \u201cWhy would you want to tell your children stories that hurt? But not learning why things are the way they are makes for another kind of hurt.\u201d It\u2019s important to get through it.\n\nIt is. It\u2019s not like our grandparents and elders are sitting around waiting to tell you how hard it was all the time. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re at the dinner table \u2014I mean, we express that culturally. There are certain things in the diaspora that are so beautiful and genius, and the wisdom of how it\u2019s passed on, but there are people that are just like, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. What we\u2019re going through in our generation is asking questions, particularly now. With the conditions and what we\u2019re facing in 2017 collectively, we\u2019re looking for answers, for the way forward.\n\nWhat advice would you give a younger person who wants to have that conversation with their parent about their history? What questions do you start with?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter this most recent election, I think the country went into a state of trauma because we\u2019re all trying to figure out what does this mean to us for communities of color. For women, for a lot of people who have a very clear understanding of what it means to feel marginalized and oppressed, we said, okay so now we\u2019re just gearing up for this next wave. For me, in having conversations with elders, I like to put it out there like that, like: let\u2019s be in conversation about what did you do back then about what worked and what tools we need to be equipped with to process what\u2019s happening around us. That\u2019s why I really loved Fania and Angela and my mom toward the end of the film. I think hopefully it ends on something that feels positive. Because we are equipped with more than we know.\n\nYour mom was close with historical figures who are also under-recognized. Charlene Mitchell...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople who you don\u2019t realize\u2014that she was the first woman to run for President. Charlene Mitchell, I love that you mention her because people have no idea. She actually came to one of the screenings in New York and I had to give her a standing ovation, because her contribution to who I am right now is not to be taken lightly. I love that you\u2019re asking about so much of the future and the way forward and hopefully people can watch the film and not feel discouraged. Even though that history is painful and there\u2019s suffering the loss that Grenada did\u2014the people connected to my mother\u2019s story\u2014does not mean that the future is not hopeful and positive. We do harness something in our DNA that is so powerful and can change the world, for everybody.\n\nThere\u2019s a big focus on the black woman\u2019s roles in activism and liberation and their idea of a social utopia\u2014working toward that. Which is important to telling the story of America. I love that your mother had a lot of receipts to show for those days. Like, the old tapes of radio broadcasts in Grenada that serve as artifacts.\n\nRight, well, the fact that we don\u2019t even know that there are other approaches to joy and taking care of your family and being respected as a human being than the model that we are exhausting right now. I think we\u2019re seeing the effects of that in this country. Clearly, something\u2019s not working with this by design. I think if you continue to only value a model that was built on slavery and the annihilation of native peoples, the consequences of that, we clearly are still suffering from and playing out. So if you for a second can imagine an alternative to this very individualistic and greedy and capitalist form to living your life, I feel like the possibilities are endless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReagan played a huge role in your mom\u2019s life. We get to see how his policies had an actual emotional effect on people, how he imposed his idea of democracy and the false narrative of him liberating Grenada. How did you want to fit in the Reagan part of the story?\n\n\n\nRight, Reagan is this recurring character in the film. The big question to me is a larger question about leadership and what it looks like. And that this traditional form of what we call a democracy continues to fail people, and especially when it\u2019s a single person that can wield so much havoc on the world. It really makes you wonder what of this is real. This idea of power that is given to this single individual, when I look at that period of time and the most powerful people are the ones in the margins. The people that came out to get Angela out of prison. The people that mobilized to get my mother into school. It\u2019s really an incredible force and we don\u2019t value that power culturally in the same way we view this kind of traditional hierarchy power that is given to white men. Reagan, for me, represents all of those things. What is the presidency? What is power? Is he the smartest person in the room? Not at all.\n\nThe real leaders are the people who were working desperately to combat his policies and the things he was doing that we\u2019re still feeling the effects of. That\u2019s leadership. But yeah, Reagan is deep, and it\u2019s funny because he\u2019s this character that we look back now and it\u2019s this romanticized actor, Hollywood president and it\u2019s quite tragic. We give that kind of superficial two-dimensional power to people and it\u2019s very dangerous. I look at Reagan often and he\u2019s talked about glossy-eyed revisionist history of the Reagan years and I\u2019m watching George Bush, we\u2019re in dire conditions right and now and all of a sudden he\u2019s some kind of hero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople watching will make the connection to Trump, but you don\u2019t outright mention him in your documentary. Was that on purpose? You didn\u2019t want any Trump reference in there?\n\nYeah, I think I wanted people to just feel that. I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to be particularly didactic about exactly where we are. It really is a feeling film that\u2019s rooted in family. It would\u2019ve been easy for me to go down a hundred different paths with this. Cointelpro alone, U.S. imperialism and militarization alone, the expansion of the prison industrial complex. That\u2019s why I wanted every social, political narrative outside of our family to still be through the lens of my personal experience or my mother\u2019s personal experience. I think people respond to seeing themselves.\n\nHow did learning your mother\u2019s story change your perspective of her?\n\nOh wow. I think it just confirmed a lot of things that I realize now, at 43, she was doing. I recognized why she didn\u2019t tell us everything. I recognize how much sacrifice my mother and other mentors around her gave. The stuff that they did and were willing to do to imagine a better world is a gift that is beyond. Just beyond. And so I think with my mother and I, I really just learned more about her and I\u2019ve learned more about myself through this. Like many in her generation and the generations before, they gave selflessly because they knew it was the right thing. They knew that social justice had to be part of what it meant to live. So I think I\u2019ve embraced that fully and appreciate that even more so now.", "keywords": ["mothers", "tells", "director", "baker", "think", "grenada", "black", "mother", "migration", "dont", "things", "family", "film", "damani", "really", "history", "eyes"], "polarity": 0.11686426110681077, "subjectivity": 0.4844402993989086},

Oh, except in the infamous shantytowns where tens of thousands of black South Africans were forced to live in conditions that would make that \u201cshack\u201d look like the fucking Ritz.\n\nPhoto: Hamish Blair (Getty Images)\n\nBut the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance comes when Southern interviews a white South African woman who says she can\u2019t walk around her neighborhood at night because the blacks will \u201crape you, beat you up.\u201d She says her children are being teased by black children \u201cin their own language,\u201d which she tearfully cannot understand. So much so that she actually wants to leave the country. \u201cWe are human beings just like them, just the color and the language is different.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t say.\n\nThe crazier part is how many South Africans and white Europeans were in shrill agony saying that what is happening to these deserving whites is the worst thing since Syrians bombed their own people with sarin gas (OK\u2014they didn\u2019t say that, but they did say they that should be \u201crelocated.\u201d)\n\nScreenshot: Facebook\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also said that what was happening was \u201crape culture.\u201d\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Facebook\n\nAnd, of course, that this is total \u201creverse racism\u201d and that \u201cWhite lives matter.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Facebook\n\nScreenshot: Facebook\n\nSome black people, on the other hand, were nonplussed.\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Facebook\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this response is labeled \u201cinhumane.\u201d\n\nThe question is, have these people no sense of history, context or irony? Maybe white poverty is increasing because they actually have to compete with blacks for jobs. Maybe they don\u2019t work hard enough. Maybe they\u2019re just dumb and lazy. I don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat\u2019s really glaring is the sense of entitlement that white Americans and white South Africans both have. Hmm. Let\u2019s see. What do they have in common? General wealth? Check. Some of the world\u2019s highest rates of incarceration and HIV? Yup (except this affects only the blacks in those countries). What else? Oh yes, a once-legal but still-pervasive racial caste system, which gifts and curses whites into thinking that they are so much of a god that the world owes them something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s an idea for these poor, sad, white South Africans: Get a job. Work harder. Do better. Don\u2019t rely on the government so much. Stop having kids. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Go back to your own country.\n\n\n\nThe gall of these people is incredible.

They brought us classics like \u201cMe So Horny\u201d and \u201cPop That Coochie.\u201d Luke was the king of party jams, and he brought us many perennial classics. I was at a \u201990s party in Atlanta a few weekends back that I had no business being at. I, myself, throw a \u201990s party in Washington, D.C., so it wasn\u2019t the music. It makes sense to focus on the \u201990s because of how hip-hop and R&B specifically evolved\u2014the music is revered and will always be great for parties and dressing up and shit.\n\nNo, I had no business being at this particular \u201990s party because I\u2019m almost 40 years old and was probably one of the youngest people in there. I definitely saw your grandma in there, who was partying with me and you, your mama and your cousin, too. Your family that don\u2019t go out often and overdress when they do? They were in that bitch. I saw sequins and stilettos, painted-on beards, zoot suits, Stacy Adams, dudes who obviously never wear suits wearing suits, buttoned-down silk and rayon shirts, etc.\n\nListen\u2014I\u2019m not judging. I\u2019m happy all of those folks were getting their life at this hotel party in Atlanta. But I was definitely too young to be there, and for the first time in a VERY long time, I looked out of place in my modern clothing choices. Zara? Nah, b. We\u2019re talking Harold Pener and wherever women go to get Harold Pener-esque attire.\n\nWhile I was there, though, legendary DJ Frank Ski dropped \u201cScarred\u201d and the room entirely lost its shit. Again, this is a group of people who were probably in their teens through late 30s when Luke dropped his Uncle Luke album with that banger on it in 1996. The room went apeshit. Grandmothers scrubbed the ground, asses replaced faces and the entire room basically leveled up 2000 percent while heels came off and butts got to shakin\u2019. It was truly a sight to see; it took me back to my college years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother song that came out WELL before I hit college but is a tag team party jam for \u201cScarred\u201d is Luke\u2019s 1991 song \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown).\u201d I think most folks probably just call it \u201cDoo Doo Brown,\u201d though the first time I heard that phrase was from the Baltimore club song of the same name by the Frank Ski-helmed group 2 Hype Brothers & a Dog.\n\nNow, both songs are total club bangers, but I wonder: Which one is better? I realize that this is splitting hairs. And while I originally thought that \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d was the better club jam, the truth is, \u201cScarred\u201d brought us Trick Daddy Dollars, and almost everything is better when Trick Daddy is involved. I have no idea why he is so likable, but by George, he is\u2014especially on \u201cScarred.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhich song makes folks get on the dance floor and get asses moving more assmovedly? I have no idea; I\u2019ve seen entire rooms explode on both songs. Any song with Trick Daddy that mentions Captain D\u2019s, Free Willy, Santa Claus and Pocahontas might be the default winner. But it\u2019s a question worth asking: Which song is the better club jam: \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d or \u201cScarred\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou made a pretty boy player wanna know.", "keywords": ["wanna", "luke", "brown", "rock", "trick", "club", "90s", "doo", "song", "whats", "scarred", "jam", "better", "lukes", "party"], "polarity": 0.22468500797448168, "subjectivity": 0.5097368421052633},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["wanna", "getty", "images", "marvel", "wakanda", "veronica", "style", "styles", "wear", "look", "film", "black", "love", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

A family friend told them about Peoples Temple, which supposedly had a great rehab program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany African Americans joined the organization for similar reasons and because of its diversity and racial integration, which are an anomaly in religious congregations to this day.\n\nWagner-Wilson said that soon, though, Jones\u2019 message turned dark.\n\n\u201cI think he was so insecure that he would always tout his sexual prowess and talk about how men were homosexuals,\u201d she said. \u201cHe treated the women better because the women were more loyal. \u2026 But also, he was very manipulative and would try to separate families and destroy marriages, which would give him more power.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe A&E documentary is about four \u201cloyal\u201d women who helped Jones carry out his sick plan of mass suicide in the South American nation, where his congregation abruptly moved after American authorities began to investigate claims of abuse.\n\n\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Wagner-Wilson said of suddenly moving to Guyana. \u201cWe had outhouses. We didn\u2019t have flushing toilets \u2026 cold showers were OK because it was so humid and hot. But I went in with an open mind and tried to find the positive in that.

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time.

Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["know", "marvel", "important", "wakanda", "walks", "panther", "different", "africa", "production", "beachler", "studiosdisney", "world", "black", "designer", "told", "hannah"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

That led to meeting Eileen Ford, the legendary owner of Ford Models. At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite.

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

Why would a woman as talented and ambitious as Horton settle for that?\n\nTo date, she\u2019s already held posts as the New York Times\u2019 marketing director for luxury brands, tasked with bringing in new revenue streams for the newspaper. She was also executive director of creative services and communications at American Vogue, overseeing a team dedicated to promotions, events and all client advertising, and was head of global communications at Shopbop (owned by Amazon.com), with responsibility for the development and execution of Shopbop\u2019s global communications and public relations strategy.\n\nFrom Horton\u2019s eagle-eye vantage point, it appears that we have only begun to glimpse the potential for customizing the client experience and for maximizing the profitability of digital luxury marketing. Horton is on a trajectory to reach the apex of the fashion business, and she\u2019s not going alone: Today marks the launch of Fashion Tech Connects, a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring the next generation of black and brown women hoping to reach fashion\u2019s highest executive ranks.\n\nHow does she do it? It\u2019s all in a stylish day\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen The Glow Up caught up with Horton, it was an early workday morning, featuring front-page fashion news: Horton and the board members of Alexander Wang had decided to break away from New York Fashion Week, a trending marketing move in the design community, Horton says. It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture.

Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked.

He also obtained his Bachelor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union\u2019s Graduate School of Religion. In 1950 he married Theresa Edwards, with whom he eventually had four children: Wyatt Jr., Robert, Earl and Ann.\n\nWalker began his civil rights work in Virginia and served as president for five years of the Petersburg branch of the NAACP and as state director of the Congress of Racial Equality, which he co-founded in 1958.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe joined the SCLC in 1961\u2014personally recruited by King\u2014and eventually moved to Atlanta to serve as its first full-time executive director. In 1965 Walker moved to Harlem, where he initially was a minister at the historic Abyssinian Baptist Church. Two years later, he became the pastor and chief executive of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, a post he held until 2004.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Walker served as urban affairs specialist to New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, helping advise on racial relations and integration. In 1975 he completed his doctorate at Colgate Rochester Divinity School.\n\n\n\nOf his myriad civil rights works, the Times reports that as pastor of Canaan, Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly, and what the church calls the oldest senior-services center in Harlem. He also established Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank. After retiring from Canaan after suffering a series of strokes, he moved to Virginia in 2004, where he remained until his death.\n\nHarlem\u2019s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture collected his papers from the period 1963-1982.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even among our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\nEspecially in considering Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th president\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u201cexclude the idea of color as race,\u201d she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling just over a week ago, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, one made by American (semi-)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Ala. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great Southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the Stars and Stripes famously hand-sewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that makes up the country her husband so recently led?\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown at the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South:\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u201ctruthful\u201d\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Ala., with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 census. In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. visited the enclave\u2014primarily African American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry\u2014three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York City mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the Creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be shortsighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former first lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because, ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder? Said Cabrera:\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out, and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us who, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic for our first black first lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d", "keywords": ["gees", "bend", "quilts", "think", "lady", "obama", "dress", "included", "picture", "portrait", "black", "michelle"], "polarity": 0.14501168400422132, "subjectivity": 0.4232492838836122},

They brought us classics like \u201cMe So Horny\u201d and \u201cPop That Coochie.\u201d Luke was the king of party jams, and he brought us many perennial classics. I was at a \u201990s party in Atlanta a few weekends back that I had no business being at. I, myself, throw a \u201990s party in Washington, D.C., so it wasn\u2019t the music. It makes sense to focus on the \u201990s because of how hip-hop and R&B specifically evolved\u2014the music is revered and will always be great for parties and dressing up and shit.\n\nNo, I had no business being at this particular \u201990s party because I\u2019m almost 40 years old and was probably one of the youngest people in there. I definitely saw your grandma in there, who was partying with me and you, your mama and your cousin, too. Your family that don\u2019t go out often and overdress when they do? They were in that bitch. I saw sequins and stilettos, painted-on beards, zoot suits, Stacy Adams, dudes who obviously never wear suits wearing suits, buttoned-down silk and rayon shirts, etc.\n\nListen\u2014I\u2019m not judging. I\u2019m happy all of those folks were getting their life at this hotel party in Atlanta. But I was definitely too young to be there, and for the first time in a VERY long time, I looked out of place in my modern clothing choices. Zara? Nah, b. We\u2019re talking Harold Pener and wherever women go to get Harold Pener-esque attire.\n\nWhile I was there, though, legendary DJ Frank Ski dropped \u201cScarred\u201d and the room entirely lost its shit. Again, this is a group of people who were probably in their teens through late 30s when Luke dropped his Uncle Luke album with that banger on it in 1996. The room went apeshit. Grandmothers scrubbed the ground, asses replaced faces and the entire room basically leveled up 2000 percent while heels came off and butts got to shakin\u2019. It was truly a sight to see; it took me back to my college years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother song that came out WELL before I hit college but is a tag team party jam for \u201cScarred\u201d is Luke\u2019s 1991 song \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown).\u201d I think most folks probably just call it \u201cDoo Doo Brown,\u201d though the first time I heard that phrase was from the Baltimore club song of the same name by the Frank Ski-helmed group 2 Hype Brothers & a Dog.\n\nNow, both songs are total club bangers, but I wonder: Which one is better? I realize that this is splitting hairs. And while I originally thought that \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d was the better club jam, the truth is, \u201cScarred\u201d brought us Trick Daddy Dollars, and almost everything is better when Trick Daddy is involved. I have no idea why he is so likable, but by George, he is\u2014especially on \u201cScarred.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhich song makes folks get on the dance floor and get asses moving more assmovedly? I have no idea; I\u2019ve seen entire rooms explode on both songs. Any song with Trick Daddy that mentions Captain D\u2019s, Free Willy, Santa Claus and Pocahontas might be the default winner. But it\u2019s a question worth asking: Which song is the better club jam: \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d or \u201cScarred\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou made a pretty boy player wanna know.", "keywords": ["wanna", "luke", "brown", "rock", "trick", "club", "90s", "doo", "song", "whats", "scarred", "jam", "better", "lukes", "party"], "polarity": 0.22468500797448168, "subjectivity": 0.5097368421052633},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye.

I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art.

They brought us classics like \u201cMe So Horny\u201d and \u201cPop That Coochie.\u201d Luke was the king of party jams, and he brought us many perennial classics. I was at a \u201990s party in Atlanta a few weekends back that I had no business being at. I, myself, throw a \u201990s party in Washington, D.C., so it wasn\u2019t the music. It makes sense to focus on the \u201990s because of how hip-hop and R&B specifically evolved\u2014the music is revered and will always be great for parties and dressing up and shit.\n\nNo, I had no business being at this particular \u201990s party because I\u2019m almost 40 years old and was probably one of the youngest people in there. I definitely saw your grandma in there, who was partying with me and you, your mama and your cousin, too. Your family that don\u2019t go out often and overdress when they do? They were in that bitch. I saw sequins and stilettos, painted-on beards, zoot suits, Stacy Adams, dudes who obviously never wear suits wearing suits, buttoned-down silk and rayon shirts, etc.\n\nListen\u2014I\u2019m not judging. I\u2019m happy all of those folks were getting their life at this hotel party in Atlanta. But I was definitely too young to be there, and for the first time in a VERY long time, I looked out of place in my modern clothing choices. Zara? Nah, b. We\u2019re talking Harold Pener and wherever women go to get Harold Pener-esque attire.\n\nWhile I was there, though, legendary DJ Frank Ski dropped \u201cScarred\u201d and the room entirely lost its shit. Again, this is a group of people who were probably in their teens through late 30s when Luke dropped his Uncle Luke album with that banger on it in 1996. The room went apeshit. Grandmothers scrubbed the ground, asses replaced faces and the entire room basically leveled up 2000 percent while heels came off and butts got to shakin\u2019. It was truly a sight to see; it took me back to my college years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother song that came out WELL before I hit college but is a tag team party jam for \u201cScarred\u201d is Luke\u2019s 1991 song \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown).\u201d I think most folks probably just call it \u201cDoo Doo Brown,\u201d though the first time I heard that phrase was from the Baltimore club song of the same name by the Frank Ski-helmed group 2 Hype Brothers & a Dog.\n\nNow, both songs are total club bangers, but I wonder: Which one is better? I realize that this is splitting hairs. And while I originally thought that \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d was the better club jam, the truth is, \u201cScarred\u201d brought us Trick Daddy Dollars, and almost everything is better when Trick Daddy is involved. I have no idea why he is so likable, but by George, he is\u2014especially on \u201cScarred.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhich song makes folks get on the dance floor and get asses moving more assmovedly? I have no idea; I\u2019ve seen entire rooms explode on both songs. Any song with Trick Daddy that mentions Captain D\u2019s, Free Willy, Santa Claus and Pocahontas might be the default winner. But it\u2019s a question worth asking: Which song is the better club jam: \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d or \u201cScarred\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou made a pretty boy player wanna know.", "keywords": ["wanna", "luke", "brown", "rock", "trick", "club", "90s", "doo", "song", "whats", "scarred", "jam", "better", "lukes", "party"], "polarity": 0.22468500797448168, "subjectivity": 0.5097368421052633},

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["till", "welcome", "york", "wakanda", "bnyfw", "panther", "week", "guests", "stage", "black", "venue", "designer"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

Following several seasons in which we\u2019ve seen an uptick in black models wearing their natural tresses on the runways, this season\u2019s presentations boasted a remarkable number of naturally coiffed models on the catwalks. Even labels that typically cater to more conservative consumers, such as Tory Burch and Bottega Veneta, featured not only black models but black models sporting their natural textures in a variety of lengths, shapes and styles.\n\nAnd while it may be tempting to call it a trend, considering the fact that the past year has seen women in the armed forces wholeheartedly embracing the natural-hair movement, more natural-hair moments than ever on the red carpet, and 2018\u2019s biggest film starring a primarily black and entirely naturally styled cast, it\u2019s safe to say that #TeamNatural has gained more than a toehold in popular culture.\n\nAs model Kristina Elise told fashion site PopSugar: \u201cFor me, leaving my hair natural for the runway is really important.

Kathrada was later released from prison in October 1989 at the age of 60.\n\nAfter his release, he was elected as a member of parliament and married anti-apartheid activist Barbara Hogan, who also served time in jail for treason against the racist apartheid government.\n\nAccording to AP, more recently in his life, Kathrada was an outspoken critic of current South African President Jacob Zuma, whose presidency has been tainted by scandals involving corruption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast April, South Africa\u2019s highest court ruled that Zuma had violated his oath of office by refusing to obey an order that required him to pay back public money that was spent upgrading his rural home.

Others, including some of the writers at The Root who knew and respected Erica, were stunned at the sudden death of someone so young and so vigilant in her crusade against police brutality.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there were the white tears.\n\nThese white tears were different. They had nothing to do with Erica Garner, her activism or even her death. Caucasian tear ducts don\u2019t even open for black bodies. They only respond to the perceived oppression of white people. The salty faces were because Erica Garner\u2019s family announced that they would give interviews and comments only to black journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe outcry was immediate and deafening. Some rummaged through knapsacks filled with privilege and fake outrage to find the right words to describe their self-righteous indignation. They made it about themselves and played the \u201creverse racism\u201d card. They bemoaned the decision as discriminatory. They quickly pivoted from Erica Garner\u2019s death and spoke of how the family had lost their \u201crespect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir counterargument was obvious: Shouldn\u2019t Erica Garner\u2019s kin talk to any qualified journalist, regardless of skin color? Isn\u2019t their request against everything Erica Garner fought for? If a journalist covers social justice, why should color matter? What about equality?\n\nAlthough those are legitimate questions, it disregards the fact that black journalists may be more familiar with the cultural dynamic of the grieving process. The collective Caucasian clutching of pearls ignores the notion that the Garner family may simply feel more comfortable talking to black reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly, black media members might be more sympathetic to a black family\u2019s pain and loss. Regardless of their experience, professionalism or allyship, there are certain things even well-meaning white people can sometimes take for granted\u2014intentionally or not. While this idea might seem exclusionary and discriminatory, it is nonetheless true. How do I know?\n\nBecause I have been the well-meaning journalist who got a story wrong\u2014not because I was inconsiderate, prejudiced or unqualified\u2014but because I wasn\u2019t as vigilant as someone who was more connected to the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October, The Root was contacted regarding the story of Gemmel Moore. People wanted to know why we weren\u2019t covering the story of a black male escort who died mysteriously in the West Hollywood, Calif., home of a wealthy Democratic donor named Ed Buck.\n\nAn editor sent the initial information to me, and I followed up on the story. When I reached out to Moore\u2019s family, I was informed that they did not wish to talk at the moment, which I understood. I thought the story was interesting and important, but without access to the family, I did not pursue it further.\n\nA few weeks later, the same editor received another inquiry on the story and passed it to me again, asking if I was looking into it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnaware that media requests were being handled by Jasmyne Cannick, a black journalist, I assumed that Moore\u2019s family were not speaking to media outlets. Instead, I researched the story on my own. I scoured the archives of multiple media outlets from across the country. I read police reports. I waded through campaign donation data and used more than a dozen sources, including Jasmyne Cannick\u2019s stories.\n\nAfter the story was published, Cannick emailed to me a list of inaccuracies in the story and simultaneously published her email. She called it \u201chorrible and inaccurate.\u201d Even though I have regularly reported on LGBTQ issues, she pointed out that I had wrongly referred to Moore as a \u201cprostitute\u201d instead of as an escort. She wondered if I \u201cpersonally have issues with Black gay men or the same-gender loving community ... \u201d She said that I wouldn\u2019t have misspelled Moore\u2019s mother\u2019s name if I had spoken with Moore\u2019s family. She was upset that the story contained news reports that were often more delicate in their portrayal of the rich, white political insider who allegedly killed a young black man than they were to Moore\u2019s memory. She asked if I thought I was doing Moore\u2019s family a favor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: She was right.\n\nI could have publicly responded to Cannick. I could have referred to my numerous sources. I could have listed the number of times I had written about homophobia and transphobia in the black community and in America as a whole. I could have reminded her of how many people now knew about Moore\u2019s story, even with the inaccuracies. I could have been as butt-hurt as the nonblack journalists are about the request by Erica Garner\u2019s family. I could have publicly feuded with Cannick, defended my story and made it about me.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t my story. It belonged to Moore\u2019s family. It was Gemmel Moore\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will never know if I simply contacted Moore\u2019s family at the wrong time or if they were only interested in speaking to members of the press who knew and were sympathetic to the details of Moore\u2019s life and death. But I will get to write many more stories. Some of them, more than likely, will highlight the pervasive disregard for the lives of black members of the gay and transgender community. The nonblack journalists weeping about their mistreatment by Garner\u2019s family will soon have the chance to cover the death of another black activist or person killed because their skin contains a little too much melanin.\n\nThe Garner family\u2019s request to speak only with black journalists might seem racist, but it is also prudent. Here\u2019s who probably won\u2019t correctly tell the story of Erica Garner: Anyone who doesn\u2019t respect the wishes of a grieving family.\n\nThe Garners\u2019 wish may prevent Erica\u2019s activism from being covered by mainstream outlets, but it also might serve their purpose of making sure her story is told correctly. It might also make media outlets realize that they need to hire more black journalists. It definitely made white people feel uncomfortable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot as uncomfortable as, say ... seeing a video of your father getting the life choked out of him being played on an infinite loop. It might not be as displeasing as watching the man whose arms were wrapped around the throat of your father when he died walk away unpunished.\n\nBut it still hurts. You can feel it in the angry tweets. However, their flaming, frost-colored ass rage will soon dissipate, and they will eventually recover from their perceived oppression. And they will somehow forge ahead into the bright future, forgetting about the one time a black woman almost caused them to choke to death on their own white tears.\n\nAnd Erica Garner will still be dead.", "keywords": ["media", "garner", "death", "wont", "caucasity", "white", "erica", "talk", "family", "black", "garners", "outrage", "journalists", "moores"], "polarity": 0.08293099647266315, "subjectivity": 0.48601501379279133},

If she has her way, the power and impact of African-American contribution to fashion design will be eternal.\n\nTo that end, Henderson gathered together a powerhouse crew of New York\u2019s most influential black bloggers, editors and journalists for the first Black Fashion History Dinner on the eve of New York Fashion Week 2018. Famed restaurant Red Rooster of Harlem was the venue for a panel discussion featuring star guest Dapper Dan, among others, moderated by veteran fashion journalist Teri Agins, who is the author of the insider fashion books The End of Fashion and Hijacking the Runway.\n\nThe discussion opened with Agins declaring that \u201ccollaboration is the future of fashion!\u201d Dapper Dan\u2014now collaborating with former fashion foe Gucci from a newly refurbished townhouse in Harlem that\u2019s Gucci branded from stoop to roof\u2014dove right in on the subject:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe difference between me and a designer is that they create from their [own] minds,\u201d he said. \u201cOur people need a say in how they look.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome say that Dapper Dan, through his early-\u201980s remixing of logo brands like Gucci, MCM and Louis Vuitton into one-of-a-kind pieces for the hip-hop and elite street hustlers, defined a golden era of fashion.

He kept the Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row crowd laughing and learning, especially when it came to the subject of business. His multiyear deal with luxury powerhouse Kering\u2014underwriters of Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent, among other labels\u2014is one that he held out for in negotiations, saying, \u201cI wanted a partnership where I can be on the same trajectory, producing with the same dignity and respect as Tom Ford or Marc Jacobs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Dap advised younger designers that \u201ctechnology is the palette of the future,\u201d his closing wisdom was about preserving our legacy: \u201cHarlem has a global [design] currency that we need to hold on to, not let it go like we let Harlem go with gentrification.\u201d\n\nPost-panel, Omar Salam, a relative unknown, yet one of the most skilled and exciting designers now showing, gave a knockout presentation of his Sukeina line. Salaam killed it with marabou-trimmed cocktail dresses, structured jackets and sleek sheaths with embroidered bodices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarlem\u2019s Fashion Row gave us a very bright glimpse at black fashion\u2019s future built on our fashion legacy. The evening\u2019s mission? To harness our collective power to share information and make black-owned businesses grow.\n\nSharing information is exactly how Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row began. By chance, Henderson met Lois Alexander Lane, the fashion historian who founded the now defunct Black Fashion Museum, who at the time was compiling a book project on the history of African-American designers, called Fashion in Color. It was a labor of love, which, upon her death, Lane passed on to Henderson to continue.\n\nHenderson found her calling, and on this evening, with some of black fashion\u2019s most important influencers gathered in one room, she made her mission clear: Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row exists \u201cto present opportunities to expand a designer\u2019s visibility by having them show their collection at events with fashion influencers. Moving forward, our goal is to connect designers with revenue-generating opportunities with large brands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, they\u2019ve presented over 50 designers\u2014including CFDA winner Telfar Waraire Boswell\u2014to buyers, press and fashion professionals. Henderson, now profitable through a combination of speaking engagements, corporate-sponsored events and selling designers on her site, developed by Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row, has an even bigger endgame in mind.\n\n\u201cI want to create a label that allows us to work with designers of color across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to use the label to launch the designer with HFR x Designer collaborations that would provide revenue for designers.\u201d\n\nSo what can we do to support the future of black fashion design? \u201cTalk about it. Even if you can\u2019t buy it, talk about it!\u201d Henderson says. Which makes sense: Gucci is not famous in our community because we all buy it but because we all talk about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other thing we can do is support our own legacy. Henderson says: \u201cWe would love people to download our new book, Fashion in Color, on our website. It\u2019s free!

But the truth is, the network has been slowly working at this for years. And history, not music, has been the main driver when it comes to the miniseries that air on the network.\n\n\n\nReportedly, great viewer reception to the reairing of Roots, as well as Roots: The Next Generations, Roots: The Gift and Queen back in 2012, helped BET join forces with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. to produce The Book of Negroes.\n\nBased on a novel by Canadian author Lawrence Hill, the miniseries aired to some acclaim in 2015. Hill built his impactful work around the actual Book of Negroes, a historical record of enslaved Africans who helped the British and were granted their freedom in Nova Scotia. And this year, BET is keeping the momentum going with Madiba.\n\nStarring Laurence Fishburne as the internationally celebrated freedom fighter Nelson Mandela, Madiba, which airs over three weeks\u2014Feb. 1, 8 and 15\u2014is based on two Mandela autobiographies: Conversations With Myself and Nelson Mandela by Himself. It was filmed in South Africa, including Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for nearly three decades. The Kevin Hooks-directed miniseries is touted as one of the most personal portrayals of Mandela to date, as well as the first major production about the legend helmed by an African-American director.\n\nProductions about Mandela\u2014who rose from being a leading anti-apartheid activist with the African National Congress, resulting in a lengthy imprisonment, to become South Africa\u2019s first democratically elected and first black president\u2014have been prominent. In 2013 Idris Elba starred as the icon in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Morgan Freeman famously played the great leader in the soccer-themed Invictus, directed by Clint Eastwood, in 2009. And Terrence Howard got a shot at portraying him in Winnie Mandela, the T.D. Jakes-produced film about Mandela\u2019s famous second wife starring Jennifer Hudson, released in 2013. And now Fishburne, who is best-known these days as Pops from the ABC hit sitcom Black-ish, is taking his turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe miniseries spans the period from Mandela\u2019s life as a child until his historic election as president. Except for a very brief time, the 55-year-old Fishburne plays Mandela from roughly his mid-20s until his mid-70s. As strong an actor as Fishburne is, this move doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for the first installment of the miniseries. But as it plays on, the story and his age gel more.\n\nAlso, unlike other Mandela productions, his comrades are particularly prominent. So fellow ANC activists such as Walter Sisulu, who is credited with bringing Mandela into the ANC and is played by David Harewood from the series Supergirl, as well as nonblack comrades Joe Slovo (Jason Kennett), Ahmed Kathrada (Meren Reddy) and Ruth First (Kate Liquorish), make an appearance.\n\nOrlando Jones, who plays Mandela\u2019s law partner and closest friend, Oliver Tambo, is surprisingly outstanding\u2014actually, unrecognizably so. It may take a while for Drumline\u2019s Dr. Lee to register, if he ever registers at all. Terry Pheto, who plays Winnie, is the rare black South African in a prominent role, and she is particularly compelling, especially in the final installment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those familiar with Mandela\u2019s history and that of the ANC, there will be no real surprises. Madiba\u2014\u201cMadiba\u201d is Mandela\u2019s Xhosa name (Xhosa is South Africa\u2019s second-largest ethnic group after the Zulus)\u2014is a pretty faithful history, capturing key moments like Mandela\u2019s early rise to prominence; his role in radicalizing the ANC; his Rivonia trial, which sent him and his comrades to Robben Island; his time at Robben Island, as well as the Sharpeville massacre in 1960; the Soweto student uprising in 1976; the questionable death of popular leader Steve Biko; and the assassination of youth leader Chris Hani.\n\nA recurring theme is the stress Mandela\u2019s activism placed on his wives and children. It is very clear that Mandela\u2019s activism came at a huge personal price. The increasing tension between him and Winnie is particularly compelling.\n\n\n\nWhile BET should certainly be commended for stepping up to the original-programming plate in such a big way and for recognizing the need to tell historic black stories of the United States and the African continent, a Madiba miniseries exploring Mandela\u2019s presidency, the changing South Africa and his death might have been a better approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not that this one isn\u2019t of value. After all, if U.S. schools barely teach black American history, they certainly don\u2019t teach South African history. And one of the most enlightening aspects of Madiba is the obvious parallels it makes to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and the rise of black nationalism in this country. At times, Mandela is both Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, but toward the end he is a little Obama, too.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the folks at BET are banking that, when it comes to anything Mandela, they just can\u2019t go wrong. And here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re right.\n\nMadiba airs on BET on Feb. 1, 8 and 15 at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT.", "keywords": ["mandelas", "starring", "icon", "plays", "miniseries", "bets", "fishburne", "black", "anc", "african", "class", "mandela", "bet", "madiba", "history", "south", "session", "laurence"], "polarity": 0.13825716477615219, "subjectivity": 0.4903770069592853},

The video was quickly shared all over the internet, and naturally people were empathetic to Keaton and even extended their friendship and love to him.\n\nBut then the internet found out that Keaton\u2019s parents are card-carrying racists and took back their support.

So imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe has been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time she has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African Diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["dj", "night", "dressed", "york", "dope", "double", "inside", "women", "think", "feel", "life", "wardrobe", "really", "career", "sophia", "hyacinthe", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["wanna", "getty", "images", "marvel", "wakanda", "veronica", "style", "styles", "wear", "look", "film", "black", "love", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess.

But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

Nearly 20 percent of the population, or 7 million people, is infected, and in some parts of the country, such as in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, estimates place the number of HIV-positive people at nearly 30 percent.\n\nThe Post reports that this trial is only the seventh full-scale human trial for a virus that kills more than 1 million people every year.\n\nThere is a desperate need for vaccine trials, but they have a long history of failure, are difficult to design, and are large, complicated and expensive, notes the Post. Should the vaccine prove to be even 50 percent effective, that would be sufficient for drugmakers to begin licensing negotiations with the South African government.\n\nThe Post notes that about 5,400 people\u2014who must be HIV-negative, sexually active, and between the ages of 18 and 35\u2014are being recruited for the trial. Each will receive five injections over the course of the year and then be monitored for two years. Half the volunteers will receive a placebo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHIV and AIDS have wreaked havoc, especially on black South Africa, where hardly anyone has remained untouched. The virus still carries with it a stigma, so those infected sometimes waste away in isolation.\n\nOne 29-year-old South African woman, Thembi Dlamini, estimates that half her friends are HIV-positive. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose another member of my family,\u201d Dlamini said. \u201cI want to be one of the ones who helped prevent this thing for the future.\u201d\n\nIn 2007 South Africa was one site of a second phase of testing for an HIV vaccine, but it had to be shuttered when early results showed that the vaccine seemed to be making people more susceptible to HIV than the placebo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResults from the new study are not expected until 2020, though the test could be ended earlier if it shows spectacular results or unexpected problems.

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for. The woman who, no matter what she\u2019s been through, puts on the clothes with her head held high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat beautiful black girls might we expect to see high-stepping on Brandon Maxwell\u2019s runway this season?\n\n\u201cWe are still in the process of casting, so no spoilers!\u201d he says. \u201cEach season, we prioritize diversity in our runway casting and do our best to represent the Brandon Maxwell woman: strong, sophisticated and confident.\u201d\n\nYou can trust that The Glow Up will be there to see our beautiful queens serve the people in the next chapter of his fashion fairy tale.", "keywords": ["maxwell", "brandon", "times", "charm", "fashion", "maxwells", "campaign", "video", "smalls", "believes", "model", "riley", "blackgirlmagic", "3rd", "love", "models", "designer"], "polarity": 0.27941388373531234, "subjectivity": 0.556208410636982},

Sharon Reed\u2019s obvious (and exaggerated) mirth and patience when explaining to Kathy Rae that she actually didn\u2019t say that white people couldn\u2019t talk about race.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["action", "designer", "hiring", "missing", "simply", "problem", "chasemarshall", "black", "industry", "talent", "fashion", "designers"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

It was only a few months ago that Chrisette Michele peered into an envelope containing a check and proposal from Orange Hitler, chunked up the deuces to the black community and hopped into a limo to be the featured shucker at Donald Trump\u2019s white supremacist takeover bash inauguration concert. Saying she was \u201cwilling to be a bridge\u201d to the black community, Michele proudly took the bag of money in exchange for serenading the soulless.\n\nNow that her record company has canceled her album, she wants to share her story of strength, perseverance and resilience with black people in hopes that black America will re=embrace her and purchase her spectacularly mediocre new single \u201cStrong Black Woman.\u201d (To be fair, I only made it through the first four bars.

I know I don\u2019t have the most popular opinion sometimes,\u201d Erykah Badu said during an interview with Vulture that left me wondering if years of breathing in incense fumes could cause brain damage, because these opinions of hers are problematic, to say the least.\n\nWhile that quote is agreeable enough, it\u2019s hard to stomach some of Badu\u2019s unpopular opinions, especially on Bill Cosby, racists and Hitler. Yes, Hitler. And this:\n\n\n\nI would never even want a group of white men who believe that the Confederate flag is worth saving to feel bad. That\u2019s not how I operate.\n\nTo say that she doesn\u2019t want racists to feel bad? Ma\u2019am. What?!\n\nNow, I understand that Badu is known as a free spirit. And most of us joke about her aura being so magnetic, it\u2019s hard not to get stuck when you\u2019re in her presence. (Word to Andr\u00e9 3000, the D.O.C., Common, Jay Electronica and any other man caught in Badu\u2019s vibes.) She playfully calls it \u201cthe Erykah Badu legend,\u201d saying, \u201cPeople think these rappers get all confused by my presence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the exciting music she\u2019s listening to, Badu mentioned, in addition to Lil Uzi Vert and D.R.A.M., rapper (and Satan\u2019s bestie) XXXTentacion. And bless the journalist, Davis Marchese, for doing his due diligence in asking the follow-up question: \u201cDo all the allegations against XXXTentacion affect how you think about his music? What\u2019s your opinion on this larger discussion happening now about about whether we can separate the art from the artist, be it XXXTentacion or Fela [Kuti] or Louis C.K. or Bill Cosby or whomever?\u201d\n\nErykah\u2019s response was about a parable centered on Jesus and Barabbas, and then she went on to give an explanation that gave me pause:\n\n... I don\u2019t want to get scared into not thinking for myself. I weigh everything. Even what you just asked me, I would have to really think about it and know the facts in each of those situations before I made a judgment. Because I love Bill Cosby, and I love what he\u2019s done for the world. But if he\u2019s sick, why would I be angry with him? The people who got hurt, I feel so bad for them. I want them to feel better, too. But sick people do evil things; hurt people hurt people. I know I could be crucified for saying that, because I\u2019m supposed to be on the purple team or the green team. I\u2019m not trying to rebel against what everybody\u2019s saying, but maybe I want to measure it. Somebody will call me and ask me to come to a march because such and such got shot. In that situation I want to know what really happened. I\u2019m not going to jump up and go march just because I\u2019m green and the person who got shot is green. The rush to get mad doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat in the Hotep hell is this, Erykah!? Baby, what is you doing?! No one is asking Badu to be a group thinker or to even take sides. But there are certain things that are just universally bad. Using your power to drug women in order to rape or sexually assault them is wrong\u2014no matter if it\u2019s one or 51 women who have accused someone. No one\u2019s asking Badu to dive into groupthink, but she\u2019s starting to sound like a Hotep Trump, who once claimed that tiki-torch-wielding white nationalists were good people.\n\n\n\nBadu\u2019s brand of humanity is a conundrum, to say the least. She believes in the good in everyone (even Hitler, and I\u2019m not using \u201cHitler\u201d metaphorically; she literally believes that there is good in Hitler\u2014Hitler!: \u201cHitler was a wonderful painter\u201d) and uses empathy to help guide her as a person in the world. It all sounds beautiful and cultlike, but unfortunately, humanity doesn\u2019t work like that. At least it didn\u2019t when Hitler slaughtered much of the Jewish population in Europe. No one cares about how awesome a painter Hitler was (or wasn\u2019t) when he designed his life around being a spawn of Satan.\n\nIt\u2019s like news outlets running headlines on the Las Vegas Strip shooter, Stephen Paddock, being a country music fan. Or Charleston, S.C., church killer Dylann Roof being a troubled teen. No one cares about the human details of their lives when their endgame was to take out as many lives as they could. I don\u2019t want to compare murder to rape here, but both are horrible crimes against humanity, and unless you\u2019re the mother of Cosby, Paddock or Roof, you shouldn\u2019t give much consideration to these people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important not to separate people like Cosby and XXXTentacion from the art they create. When we support art from problematic and predatory people, we are putting money in their pockets. And money is powerful because there are people around these problematic figures who are just trying to make a living and are often not holding them accountable. But we have to remember, when we support artists whose beliefs don\u2019t align with ours, we\u2019re as complicit as they are.\n\nThe Vulture writer, Marchese, like us, was just trying to understand Badu and her controversial opinions and said: \u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing to accept that you might be operating on a higher moral plane than I am, but I think going down the route of \u2018Hitler was a child once too\u2019 is maybe turning the idea of empathy into an empty abstraction.\u201d\n\nDing, ding, ding!\n\nLater in the interview, as the writer continues to try to understand her point of view, Badu says:\n\nWe are all living in a cognitive-dissonance reality. We want to live a certain way or do a certain thing, and we don\u2019t because we are emotionally attached to how the group thinks. The hive mentality takes over. But you know what\u2019s right in your mind and your heart, and if you\u2019re strong enough to detach from the hive then sometimes, just sometimes, you may be able to do the right thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, I guess there\u2019s that?\n\nIn response to the backlash to the article, Badu tweeted that she was open to the dialogue, but it seems that she doesn\u2019t like it when black and Jewish folks deem her problematic opinions problematic because we use the word \u201cproblematic\u201d too much:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSis, maybe you\u2019re problematic too much.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted this response to the Vulture article:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn two other tweets, Greenblatt went in on the Hitler comment:\n\nI also like to think that there is good in all people, but Hitler is pure evil. I don\u2019t care if he painted or was a vegetarian; Hitler is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews & a war that claimed the lives of tens of millions. Shame on you for downplaying that. You are a role model to many, and as such, you should immediately apologize for these irresponsible and misguided comments.\n\nIn case you want to read the interview, spoiler alert: Badu\u2019s next album may be a series of moans and hums; she sits at the bedsides of dying people as a hobby (which actually seems like a pretty relaxing way to go, with Badu at your bedside); her favorite response is, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d; and she and Common took an illegal trip to Cuba. This story was probably the best thing about the interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo go forth and educate yourself on the very different vibrations of Erykah Badu.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to include Badu\u2019s tweet and the ADL\u2019s response to the Vulture article.", "keywords": ["know", "conversation", "youre", "think", "wonder", "hitler", "response", "im", "dont", "badu", "hotepery", "cosby", "erykah", "problematic", "dabbles"], "polarity": 0.05737578914141415, "subjectivity": 0.5341888888888889},

For me, that word defines Serena Williams. I love her body\u2014it\u2019s invincible. I also love that none of her seemingly superhuman attributes were given to her or easily attained. Everything she has, she earned, one drop of sweat at a time. She and big sister Venus were their own mini-civil-rights movement as they fought to establish their place on the predominantly white tennis circuit, and they have dominated for nearly two decades.\n\nBecoming the mother to gorgeous baby girl Alexis Olympia\u2014who shares her February cover of Vogue magazine\u2014was no less a struggle than any of Williams\u2019 other feats; she came straight out of Compton, Calif., to be crowned the Best Athlete of All Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs told to Vogue, Williams\u2014newly married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2014was blessed with an easy pregnancy (as expected, given her supreme physical condition). But delivering the other cover girl on this month\u2019s Vogue was ultimately a \u201charrowing experience.\u201d Call it bad luck, but as her baby\u2019s heart rate plummeted dangerously low during birth, Williams required an emergency cesarean section.\n\nTo make matters worse, the new mother suffered a recurrence of blood clots\u2014a condition that flared up hours after the C-section that left Williams gasping for air and fearing that she was having another pulmonary embolism. After she advocated for herself and insisted on a CT scan and a blood thinner, another emergency surgery was performed to insert a filter into a major vein to clear up abdominal bleeding (a side effect of blood-thinning medication). To add to the drama, her C-section incision then ruptured because of the intense coughing caused by the blood clot. Our mighty Serena was left flat on her back for a full six weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, mother and daughter are now more than fine. Serena is up and naturally winning again, with a new clothing line launching on her website in March, serial investments in tech companies owned or led by black women, and a new home in Silicon Valley.\n\nIs she done with tennis? Not by a long shot. Twenty-three grand slams already have her name on them, and she\u2019s looking to own 25 in total, making her the greatest tennis player of all time (24 is the current record held by Australian Margaret Court).\n\nAs for motherhood, Williams only believes it ups her game, telling Vogue:\n\nKnowing I\u2019ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to play another match. I don\u2019t need the money or the titles or the prestige. I want them, but I don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s a different feeling for me ... It\u2019s interesting. ... There hasn\u2019t been a clear number one since I was there. It will be cool to see if I get there again, to what I call my spot\u2014where I feel I belong. I don\u2019t play to be the second best or the third best. If there\u2019s no clear number one, it\u2019s like, yeah, I can get my spot back. But if there is a clear number one, that\u2019s cool, too, because it\u2019s like, yeah, I\u2019m gonna come for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for introducing her daughter to Mom\u2019s stratospheric fame, Williams told Vogue that she wants baby Alexis to know that her own potential is absolutely limitless:", "keywords": ["beautiful", "olympia", "number", "tennis", "best", "mother", "baby", "alexis", "dont", "vogue", "blood", "williams", "serena", "slamming", "cover", "love", "clear"], "polarity": 0.2093217329545454, "subjectivity": 0.5015337527056276},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["wanna", "getty", "images", "marvel", "wakanda", "veronica", "style", "styles", "wear", "look", "film", "black", "love", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

He also played the drums with the Tony Williams Jazz Quartet.\n\nWhat did go unmentioned during his appearance, of course, was his looming retrial that is scheduled to begin with jury selection March 29. Cosby is once again facing charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand, a former Temple University basketball staff member, at his home near Philadelphia in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNPR reporter Bobby Allyn asked Cosby about the #MeToo movement and how it might affect his retrial, to which Cosby responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Times notes that last week, prosecutors asked a judge to allow the testimony of 19 other women who have accused Cosby of having assaulted them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis evidence is relevant to establish that an individual who, over the course of decades, intentionally intoxicated women in a signature fashion and then sexually assaulted them while they were incapacitated, could not have been mistaken about whether or not Ms. Constand was conscious enough to consent to the sexual contact,\u201d Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele wrote in a motion Thursday.\n\nRegarding Cosby\u2019s Monday performance, Constand\u2019s lawyer, Dolores Troiani, told NBC in an email that she had not seen it.\n\n\u201cRight now, the only thing I can say is the arrogance of this man leaves every decent person speechless,\u201d Troiani added.", "keywords": ["months", "assaulted", "tony", "appearance", "women", "event", "makes", "troiani", "sexual", "case", "retrial", "public", "cosby", "philly", "williams", "jazz", "club"], "polarity": 0.1630726911976912, "subjectivity": 0.5666080447330448},

On the other hand, black fashion designers? They are some of the other hidden figures on the cultural landscape.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes \"Black Fashion Designers,\" the exhibit that runs until May 16 at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, so vital and important.\n\nFor decades, black designers have been at the forefront of fashion despite facing all the challenges that daunt any new businessperson, as well as resisting the pigeonholing that comes from not being a member of the dominant demographic.\n\nYet, as the exhibit shows, there\u2019s an extraordinary range of aesthetic splendor and unique accomplishment. For instance, the wedding gown of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was designed by Ann Lowe, an African-American designer. The iconic Playboy Bunny uniform was designed by Zelda Wynn, also a black designer. Laura Smalls, one of many Afro-Diasporic designers championed by Michelle Obama, designed the red-and-white-print dress the first lady wore in July for her appearance in \"Carpool Karaoke.\"\n\nIn all, the exhibit features 75 outfits from 60 designers, plus videos of discussions headed by Washington Post fashion editor Robin Givhan and Vogue contributing editor Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack designers rose to prominence in the \u201940s and have fought for recognition and respect from the industry for more than 70 years. The exhibit details their struggles and those of black models, but the best part is the wide range of style.\n\nSome designers draw on their African heritage, abstracting kente cloth or scarification. Others offer a bold, futuristic outlook. All of the clothing displayed shows that the same extraordinary power found on the streets where we live is also on display on the runway and in the ateliers where high fashion is home.\n\nHere are several designers who stand out in the exhibit.\n\n\n\nAnn Lowe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLowe (1898-1981), who designed the ivory silk taffeta wedding dress for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis\u2019 marriage to John F. Kennedy, grew up in Alabama, the daughter and granddaughter of women who worked as seamstresses but also designed clothing.\n\nWhen Lowe was 16, her mother died while working on a series of ball gowns for Alabama\u2019s first lady, Elizabeth Kirkman. Lowe stepped in and completed the project, then attended a segregated design school. She settled in Tampa, Fla., and opened a boutique called Annie Cohen.\n\nShe later moved to New York City, where she did commissions for leading retailers and designed the Oscar gown that Olivia de Havilland wore to accept the award for To Each His Own in 1946. Lowe later opened a boutique in New York City's Manhattan, designing for wealthy clientele. The Saturday Evening Post called her \u201csociety\u2019s best-kept secret.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick Kelly\n\nIn a brief amount of time, Kelly (1954-1990) took the fashion world by storm. He grew up in Vicksburg Miss., and fell in love with fashion both via the creativity of his relatives and from the magazines that his grandmother, a domestic, brought home from work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe moved to Atlanta, where he designed the windows for the Yves Saint Laurent boutique. He then moved to Paris and quickly went from selling dresses on the street to presenting his own line of clothing. His clients included Cicely Tyson, Bette Davis and Grace Jones.\n\n\n\nDuro Olowu\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerian-born and London-based, Olowu came to fashion after starting a career as a lawyer. His work is renowned for mixing African and American iconography. Olowu, the husband of Studio Museum Director Thelma Golden, regularly presents during Fashion Week and has done collections for J.C. Penney.\n\nHe was one of four designers chosen by Michelle Obama to decorate the White House for Christmas in 2015, and he curates the prestigious London exhibit \u201cMaking and Unmaking.\u201d He told the New York Times that he collects fabric the way some people collect Rolexes.\n\n\n\nEric Gaskins\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaskins was born in Germany and grew up in New York City, where he now lives. He has said that his aim is to make clothing that is essential and without artifice and contrivance. He launched his own line in 1987, and his clothes have appeared on the covers of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Vanity Fair and Glamour.\n\nHis clients include Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek, Mariah Carey and Jada Pinkett Smith. In the \u201900s, he scandalized the fashion world as one of the anonymous writers behind the tell-all blog the Emperor\u2019s Old Clothes.\n\n\n\nAndre Walker\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker, based in Brooklyn, N.Y., got his start at an early age. He staged his first runway show at the New York City nightclub Oasis when he was only 15 years old.\n\nHe worked in Paris in the \u201990s, and his idea of the pant skirt was the inspiration for Jean-Paul Gaultier\u2019s works in a similar vein. Patricia Field described him as \u201cthe future of the new designers.\u201d After a few years out of the spotlight when he was consulting for Marc Jacobs, he has returned with a Dover Street Market line of clothes that aim for what W magazine called \u201cretail-friendly yet lofty.\u201d\n\n\n\nAisha Obuobi\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObuobi, the designer behind the company Christie Brown, is widely considered one of the leading fashion designers in Africa. Her company is based in Accra, Ghana, and her work is an integral part of Italian fashion week. Her clothes were worn frequently by Beyonc\u00e9 during the On the Run Tour. Obuobi recently told Elle magazine\u2019s South Africa edition: \u201cI\u2019d like for our clothes to be part of the African woman\u2019s journey to self-discovery. Because I believe that it is from knowing and appreciating where she\u2019s from, that she\u2019ll truly be able to come into her own.\u201d\n\nMartin Johnson writes about music for the Wall Street Journal, basketball for Slate and beer for Eater, and he blogs at both the Joy of Cheese and Rotations.

We\u2019ve since been inundated with commentary, reactions and subsequent statements from celebs, pundits, elected officials and, unfortunately, Donald Trump.\n\nFor now, at least, the demonstration seems like a relatively decisive thing to condemn: a feat, for a country that not too long ago was embroiled in several debates about whether or not it\u2019s ethical to punch Nazis or use force to prevent them from speaking at universities and possibly doxing students who are undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\nWhile repudiations are plenty, and while there seems to be a popular shift supporting the removal of monuments celebrating Confederate soldiers, it would be wise not to get too swept up in the current feel-good anti-Nazi/anti-white-supremacist frenzy. America has a pattern, and in all likelihood, this moment will follow suit.\n\nJust a few days before this nation\u2019s oppressed and disenfranchised huddled white masses took to the streets to decry their marginalization, the country was focused on another persecuted white guy\u2014former Google engineer James Damore. Damore and his leaked 10-page memo, which he claimed was aimed \u201cto improve Google\u2019s discriminatory practices,\u201d ran the gamut of clumsy evopsyche, biodeterminism, false equivalences and subtle racist dog whistles.\n\nHe even asserted that the right\u2019s denial of climate change is no different from the left\u2019s denial of biological differences between the sexes and IQ disparity. According to his manifesto, he and other like-minded people felt restricted from expressing this objective truth because of the totalitarian rule of Google\u2019s politically correct culture and malignant implementation of diversity initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that shortly after Damore\u2019s firing, he became a darling of the \u201calt-right.\u201d 4chan began to plan boycotts (one diabolical plot involved going to the library to create Gmail accounts), and he was embraced as another victim of rabid leftist \u201cSJWs\u201d and their disdain for rational white men. He was even offered a job via tweet from WikiLeaks in a show of solidarity.\n\nAlt-right memes of Damore depicting him as a crucified Pepe Frog Jesus and Google as baton-wielding Nazis beating the First Amendment circulated through social media. While Damore, no stranger to histrionics, claims that he still supports Google and hasn\u2019t been pressed to answer to why his memo resonates so much with white nationalists, he sports a T-shirt with the word \u201cGoolag\u201d displayed in the fashion of his former employer\u2019s logo in his Twitter avatar. Nothing says former Soviet political-labor-camp prisoner like having had a $250,000-per-year engineering job with amazing benefits and an on-site masseuse.\n\nThe common thread between the lionization of Damore and the rally in Charlottesville is a fundamental belief in white male victimhood: the notion that white people, particularly white men, are being oppressed by \u201cPC culture,\u201d \u201cthe intolerant left,\u201d feminists and minorities, and are systematically excluded via efforts to diversify workforces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis thread extends to other seemingly opposite or less extreme sides of political ideology, too. Even among the more cosmopolitan \u201cprogressive\u201d media outlets like The Atlantic and the New York Times, Damore\u2019s confirmation-bias-laden memo was defended from \u201ccrazed moral absolutists\u201d by the most rational and objective of white men. In defense of Damore and in response to a call to fire Google\u2019s CEO, the New York Times\u2019 David Brooks wrote, \u201cWe are at a moment when mobs on the left and the right ignore evidence and destroy scapegoats. That\u2019s when we need good leaders most.\u201d\n\nThis behavior is typical. Nothing spurs national conversations about the erosion of free speech like the minimal-to-moderate reprimand of bigoted white men. Before Damore, these same pieces were being written to defend Bill Maher against backlash for his field-nigger joke, and before Maher, it was alt-right-adjacent \u201cpolitical commentator\u201d Milo Yiannopoulos, who had been banned from Twitter. Before Yiannopoulos it was notorious white supremacist troll Chuck C. Johnson.\n\nEven the now-disgraced former Clippers owner Donald Sterling spurred a national debate about privacy and free speech. Not ironically, it was Maher who came to his defense and claimed that Sterling\u2019s \u201cprivacy violation\u201d was akin to living in East Germany. America seems to measure its morality by how fair it can be toward racists, not how far it will go to protect the marginalized groups targeted by their hatred.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis nation gets uncomfortable when white men are arguably punished. Suddenly these isolated instances, which never seem to amount to disastrous, life-shifting consequences, become ominous foreshadowing of the country\u2019s gradual decline toward an Orwellian society. The performative moral parity that has become commonplace among progressive liberal political pundits had just as much a voice in the rally to combat the \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people as the chants of \u201cWhite lives matter\u201d that echoed in the streets of Charlottesville.\n\nWhite supremacists don\u2019t have to confine themselves to subreddits and the Daily Stormer to have their imagined victimhood affirmed. They can read recent New York Times op-eds about the silencing of white men. Or revisit the dozens of profiles written about misunderstood Trump voters, replete with photos of white rural folks staring forlornly into the unknown yonder while straddling rusted tractors.\n\nThey can look to the academic language of social psychologist Jon Haidt, in which he and another white male Vox journalist discuss the \u201cdangers of multiculturalism\u201d and conclude that assimilation is the solution to polarized division on \u201cboth sides.\u201d Among the CNN interviews, the countless Vox and Vice human-interest expos\u00e9s, and the teary-eyed olive branch gestures from noted Negro-love warriors, amazingly, white supremacists still feel as if they\u2019re being neglected, erased and silenced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this country is always more than willing to indulge their ridiculous delusions, treating them like wayward teens who are simply acting out because of their parents\u2019 divorce. Long has pragmatism been distorted into a measure of how tolerant and compassionate one can be toward bigots. As more of the neo-Nazis and secessionists who participated in the rally have their identities revealed and their jobs and personal lives compromised, I fully expect America to act as it always has. Condemning Nazis (at least for now) is easy; removing Confederate monuments can be a symbolic first step.\n\nThe real work, however, comes when we accept that the racial oppression cosplay and persecution complex that fuel white supremacists aren\u2019t just confined to right-wing ideology and poor rural white people. They\u2019re just as present in the passive-aggressive bigotry that masquerades as fact-based rationalism spouted by residents of the enclaves of Silicon Valley and Manhattan. The only difference between Trump\u2019s \u201cboth-sideism\u201d and the generally accepted brand is a lack of flowery language and the facade of objectivity.\n\nTrump, as always, is simply what happens when America moves out of frame and the Snapchat filter disappears. The real test is seeing how long we can stomach adult white men suffering mild consequences without calling it the rebirth of McCarthyism, comparing it to lynch mobs or some other hyperbolic description. Quite frankly, as someone familiar with America, I fully expect to see another failing grade.", "keywords": ["nazis", "york", "times", "power", "rally", "political", "damore", "america", "white", "victimhood", "supremacists", "men"], "polarity": 0.0336008165276458, "subjectivity": 0.3149966564600711},

Barnum of fashion who has turned his distinct point of view into a budding fashion empire, debuted his latest collaboration with Jimmy Choo Tuesday night. Abloh, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West\u2019s and a Grammy nominee for his work on Watch the Throne, was propelled to the forefront of fashion via association with the Kardashian family by grace of the king-making power of their social media influence\u2014influence that has also served designers like Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, who, like Abloh, is on the rise as one of the new rulers of fashion.\n\nWhat Abloh has is a keen understanding of consumer desire\u2014a yearning to be savvy enough to incorporate high-art motifs into closet staples like boots and T-shirts, along with a craving for street cred. His Off-White label provides both, producing $1,700 satin pussy-bow blouses with ties that dust the floor, and white plastic boots with the words \u201cFor Walking\u201d or \u201cOff-White\u201d in black safety-sign lettering up the side. Even the label\u2019s logo-decaled smartphone cases retail for a cool $95 and seem to be in the palms of private school kids from coast to coast.\n\nAlboh\u2019s style is entertaining and fun, but his offerings have that kind of art-world brevity about them where, even if the high-ticket items are a joke on the buyer, it\u2019s better to be in on the joke than not to get it at all. It\u2019s exactly this kind of savvy marketing that has won the designer collaborations with brands as diverse as Ikea and famed artists like Takashi Murakami, while Off-White is a favorite among top models, luxury-fashion editors, the hip-hop crowd and those who want to feel hip by association.\n\n\n\nJimmy Choo via You Tube\n\nAbloh\u2019s newest collaborative collection, Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, brings together all the elements of his fascinations: art, fashion, and \u201980s and \u201990s iconic cool. On its website, Jimmy Choo posted that the collection was inspired by the late Princess Diana, an interesting muse, given that we are all waiting with bated breath to see how Meghan Markle will leave her stamp on royal style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also a deft move on Abloh\u2019s part; last November he was the first black designer to receive a British Fashion Council Award for Urban Luxe Brand. Princess Di and urban streetwear could not be farther part\u2014although the princess was known to put on a leotard and tights for roller-skating around the halls of Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhy this move toward regal attire and ladylike fare is so cunning on Abloh\u2019s part is that, in true P.T. Barnum style, it\u2019s a three-ring-circus. Just when you thought it was just sneakers and cellphone covers, here comes something entirely new to capture your imagination.\n\nSandra Choi, Kendall Jenner and Virgil Abloh (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) 1 / 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe party to fete his Spring/Summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection and Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, both of which will be in stores this week, drew an A-list crowd of models like Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, decked out in the Princess Di-inspired collection along with the shoes. The clothes were sophisticated and subdued for the most part\u2014garden party chintz, sharply cut suits with walking shorts and cropped jackets with lapels that jutted forward like the bow of the royal yacht\u2014while stilettos were covered in clear PVC cocoons or ruched with tulle. Tulle, that most feminine and genteel of fabrics, was also applied to thigh-high boots, casting a kind of fairy-tale softness to the look.\n\nOf the unlikely brand matchup, Abloh told Women\u2019s Wear Daily:\n\nIt was an idea I had. I\u2019d met Sandra [Choi] at the Bowery hotel, and I always had this idea within my collection to sort of get more specific and story-tell ... I was working on this collection that was a tribute to Princess Diana and [Jimmy Choo] were a shoemaker that were making shoes for her. And I thought it could have been a cool way to relate the product and the narrative of Princess Diana to a younger audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think that no matter what Abloh does, he\u2019s got a firm creative hold on the zeitgeist and will surely remain part of the greatest show on earth.", "keywords": ["kendall", "princess", "jimmy", "bnyfw", "jenner", "covet", "offwhite", "choo", "abloh", "collaboration", "collection", "fashion", "kind"], "polarity": 0.23849431818181818, "subjectivity": 0.49405513468013457},

They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["know", "consciousness", "marveldisney", "wakanda", "panther", "feel", "theyre", "wannabes", "carter", "costumes", "ruth", "film", "felt", "black", "cultural"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

(It had the desired effect.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the talk might not actually be a singular talk but a series of lessons teaching a young black person how to navigate America?\n\nI guess you can say that. Think of the talk as a \u201cHow to Survive Whiteness\u201d syllabus, with extensive lessons ranging from \u201cracial profiling\u201d to \u201cawkward seasoning.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s spread over a semester.

Not in a bad way, though. You just watch this video and know that the casting call asked three questions: 1) Can you be convincingly solemn? 2) Can you enunciate the fuck out of an adjective? 3) Can you enunciate while solemn? Basically, \u201cCan you be Courtney B. Vance?\u201d\n\nAnyway, this is part of P&G\u2019s My Black Is Beautiful campaign, which:\n\n[C]elebrates the diverse collective beauty of black women and encourages black women to define and promote our own beauty standard\u2014one that is an authentic reflection of our indomitable spirit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich, although it reads like it was written by a #BlackGirlMagic autobot, is very necessary.\n\nSo why are we talking about the talk today?\n\nBecause of the responses on P&G\u2019s Facebook page. It was a tornado of white tears. A white-tears tsunami. A white-tears turducken. A white-tears event horizon, where the white tears were spaghettified by anti-gravity. I haven\u2019t seen that many white people mad since the Lost series finale. It was truly a riot of whiteness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy were they so upset?\n\nDon\u2019t ask me! Take it from Facebook user Brian Hill, who replied, \u201cI am a proud parent of 2 African American kiddos and I\u2019m a cop. I will no longer buy any P & G products. Your divisive and biased ads will not create more customers. More will stop buying your products.\u201d\n\nA similar sentiment was echoed by Michele Yerdon Syvertsen, who shared a link to the Wikipedia page listing all of the P&G products, and called for a boycott.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA boycott? Of P&G?\n\nYes.\n\nAre they aware that P&G makes, well ... everything? Like, if you plan to boycott P&G, you\u2019re basically saying, \u201cHey, everyone. I\u2019m gonna be naked as fuck for the rest of my life. Just bare-assed every damn where. Also, I\u2019m never going to shower again. Or shit. Or eat.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. But judging by their comments\u2014both of which received hundreds of likes\u2014and the hundreds of similar comments on P&G\u2019s Facebook page, a naked, foodless, showerless and shitless life is worth standing up to P&G.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for what??? What the hell happened in the video that made them so mad? Did they film Michael Vick walking a dog? What the fuck?\n\nApparently they were triggered by an extremely tepid acknowledgment that the world might be a bit harder for black people than it is for them. The articulation of racism is racism. And not just racism, but racism-racism. That real, uncut and raw racism. Not that stepped-on shit with baking soda and milk.\n\nFrom Kevin Ferrara:\n\nTHIS is EXACTLY why racism exists in America! EVERYONE has EQUAL opportunities to be something, do something, achieve greatness...CULTURE is what holds individuals back from achieving their dreams and highest potential, not white folk and their so called privilege.

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["till", "welcome", "york", "wakanda", "bnyfw", "panther", "week", "guests", "stage", "black", "venue", "designer"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["know", "rock", "appropriationvsappreciation", "style", "right", "stella", "ankhs", "african", "ongoing", "wearing", "trend", "black", "kwanzaa", "argument", "way", "ankara", "love", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

I believe that love is a byproduct of love. I believe that hate made love to an orange, had a petty-ass baby, and that\u2019s how we got the grapefruit. I believe that cats were put on earth to kill things. And I believe the universe recycles.\n\n\n\nReincarnation is real. When we stop breathing, our bodies will all eventually turn into the fuel for flowers and trees. Those trees will, in turn, take the fuel of our decomposed former selves and convert carbon dioxide into oxygen that a newborn baby will one day inhale for the first time. We are all dying. To die is to give life.\n\nAnd if my body becomes a tiny point in the circle of life, it only makes sense that my soul will also be reincarnated. I have no idea how the universe may use my factory-refurbished soul. I\u2019m cool with becoming a yak or a large-mouthed bass in the next life. (Fair warning to the universe: I am a terrible swimmer.) There is only one thing I pray I will never be:\n\nThe white man.\n\nNot a white man, but the white man. The perpetual oppressor of people. The kicker of teeth. He who places boot on neck. I pray to the man upstairs (I\u2019m getting my roof fixed right now) that when my soul is washed, dried and placed in the \u201cbarely used\u201d bin of the universal thrift shop, I am not remade into the white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often fling disdain at people who unknowingly participate in white-mannery. I believe that any white person not actively fighting to end every form of racism and oppression is an accomplice. I fault white people who sit silently while their fellow Caucasians say or do something racist when no one black is around. I consider them to be upholders of white supremacy as much as the cross burners or swastika wearers. They are \u201cthe white man,\u201d too.\n\nBut I realize I am a living, breathing double standard.

And just as with racism, that willingness to turn our heads and not condemn sexual assault is an implicit signal that it is OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne night while I was having a few drinks with friends, a guy recognized someone at my table and came over to say hi. At some point during his conversation, the waitress came over, and out of nowhere, he asked this teenage-looking girl: \u201cCan you make it clap?\u201d\n\nEveryone knew it was kind of creepy, but I said, \u201cHey, man, what the fuck is wrong with you? That girl is, like, 16.\u201d He tried to laugh it off by joking: \u201cYou know what Keith Sweat said: She may be young, but ... \u201d\n\nBy then the rest of the people at the table agreed that he was being a little bit rapey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, I was with the same friends at the same watering hole (what, motherfucker? It\u2019s not like I live in Paris. I\u2019m in Birmingham!), and they began telling me about a high school teacher who had been arrested on charges that he slept with multiple students. Because I\u2019m not originally from this town (and apparently only go to one place to have drinks), I assumed that I didn\u2019t know who they were talking about.\n\nIt was the same rapey table crasher.\n\nHere\u2019s my point. I\u2019m not insinuating that every guy who makes suggestive comments to a Buffalo Wild Wings waitress is a potential sexual assaulter. But I wonder how often we perpetuate the ideology of the disposability of women\u2019s bodies by just not saying shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are honest, every single man has known a guy who was a habitual line stepper when it came to women or who was a little bit rapey. The frat brother who will grab a random woman\u2019s booty. The boss who has tried to fuck everyone in the office. The football teammate who always talks about \u201crunning a train.\u201d I also believe every single white person has a parent, co-worker or cousin (wait ... do white people have cousins?) who leans a \u201clittle bit racist.\u201d\n\nBut just like there is no such thing as being a little bit racist, there is no such thing as being \u201ca little bit rapey.\u201d\n\nWhy are we cool with one and not the other?\n\nIf we refused to remain quiet about the dudes who do this shit, I\u2019m not saying that it would end sexual assault, but it might curtail the actions of the men whose actions are fueled by the complicity of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone knew about Harvey Weinstein and didn\u2019t say shit. Bill Cosby\u2019s predilection for slipping Mickeys was an open secret for decades. Do you think R. Kelly\u2019s friends are just now noticing that some of the girls surrounding him are a little short in the tooth?\n\nI know some woke-ass dudes who would open-hand smack a Caucasian\u2019s face off if the white person uttered the word \u201cnigger\u201d in their presence, even if that person wasn\u2019t using the n-word in reference to anyone in particular. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the recipient of the smack were singing along to a Tupac song or used the version of the word with the \u201ca\u201d at the end\u2014he or she would become an unwilling participant in the catching of hands.\n\nBut those same woke-ass dudes wouldn\u2019t say a damn word if a guy talked about \u201ctaking some pussy\u201d or brought up booty-clapping to a teenager trying to do her job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nAnd I know some dude out there will argue that not every black man is complicit in sexual assault.

However, one email stuck out to me when it popped up in my inbox:\n\nAlthough I have redacted his name for purposes of publication, I had no idea who this person was, but for some reason, his level of outrage intrigued me. Maybe it was the idea that he thought I\u2019d be equally outraged if he started a \u201cblkpipo tournament\u201d (I wouldn\u2019t be). Maybe it was because he thought the term \u201cblkpipo\u201d was clever. (It is not.

Honestly, if he had a few more brain cells, his email might\u2019ve been funny. You try being clever and racist at the same time! It\u2019s hard, but the fact that he knew the song \u201cBecky\u201d impressed me a little bit. I imagined him dancing to it. This was beginning to thrill me!\n\nI knew it would get boring quickly if I started a battle of wits with a racist email troll, so I decided to throw him a curve when he was expecting another fastball:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess what, y\u2019all? He responded again. Honestly, there are few things wypipo hate more than being called racist\u2014even if they started the conversation by calling you \u201chypermelanated\u201d and explaining how your dark skin makes you inferior.

In all my intellectual, sexist glory, I declared that I disagreed with the entire premise. \u201cI agree that a woman is unable to give consent when she is drunk,\u201d I said. \u201cBut when I\u2019m drunk and sleep with a sober woman, does that mean I was raped?\u201d\n\n\n\nI was pretty proud of my circular logic until a woman broke down how stupid my statement was. It was willfully ignorant of the power dynamics. It turned a blind eye to the fact that men are physically stronger. It ignored the history of men taking advantage of women, the normalization of such, and how such behavior was rooted in apathetic misogyny. She broke down my stupidity into microscopic pieces and showed me how shitty each piece was. She was right.\n\nAllow me to talk to white people for a second. We know you\u2019re reading this.\n\nEvery now and then, white people will use the same circular logic I described in the first paragraph. They will ask why we can say \u201cnigga\u201d but they can\u2019t. They will hear or read a joke about unseasoned chicken or dancing off-beat and begin their next sentence with, \u201cIf a white person said that ... \u201d They quickly interrupt any reference to white people being racist or prejudiced with, \u201cHey, not all white people!\u201d\n\nAnd absolutely nothing makes them more upset than the word \u201cwypipo.\u201d It rattles their cages. It burns their insides like Texas Pete on a hot wing (yes, that\u2019s how black I am: I put hot sauce on hot wings).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week we began the 2017 World Wypipo Tournament. I think the concept is hilarious, as do many of our readers, both black and white. But in the comments, there have been the inevitable few people butt-hurt about the use of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d\n\nI am one of the few people for whom words cannot hurt. I don\u2019t get outraged about much, and definitely not from words written by a person I\u2019ve never met. If I write a \u201cwypipo\u201d article every day, it still won\u2019t match the number of times I\u2019ve been called \u201cnigger\u201d in some form or fashion. I promise you, however, that I am not trying to catch up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the phrase and all the variations of it are sidesplittingly funny (the formal \u201cY. P. Pull,\u201d the hipster \u201cWhy Pee Pole\u201d and the Southern \u201cWipe E. Puh\u201d). I make an effort to point out that the word doesn\u2019t mean every single person of Caucasian descent. (Although, to be honest, it kinda does. Many of us people assume that all white people are wypipo\u2014just to be safe. In fact, if you are upset by the previous statement because you assumed the phrase wasn\u2019t referring to you\u2014you\u2019re probably wypip0.)\n\nI can understand why some people don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny. Humor is subjective. What is stupid, however, are the people who say it\u2019s racist because if they used a term for black people, they\u2019d be called racist.\n\nAs if they don\u2019t understand the power dynamics in America. As if they are willfully ignorant of the 510 years of white supremacy whereby their people got to call black people whatever the hell they wanted. As if black people could give a damn what they are called when they are still treated like niggers. As if they don\u2019t know how racism works. How words work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a nephew who used to love to punch me in the stomach as hard as he could. He thought I was so strong because I could take his punches. I didn\u2019t want to tell him, \u201cNigga, you\u2019re 3! You can\u2019t hurt me!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the same way I\u2019d feel if I were white in America. Words? If my ceiling were limited only by my education, dedication and ability, I wouldn\u2019t give a damn about some smart-ass slur on The Root. You think I\u2019d be upset by words if I could live in a universe knowing that my fate simply depended on how hard I worked or how talented I was? I am always astounded that there aren\u2019t more white atheists. What the hell does a white man need a God for?\n\nThat\u2019s why I roll my eyes every time I hear or see the phrase, \u201cImagine what would happen if a white man said that.\u201d I don\u2019t have to imagine. I live in the brick-and-mortar reality of it. I have felt the fear of death squeeze my heart, only to realize that the flashing blue lights were from a street sign. I have been a child and a grown man who watched opportunity snatched from me, only to see it gently placed in the lap of a white boy or man with lesser ability. I have sat down with my children and given a lesson on how society views them because of the color of their skin. I have wondered if my lesson even mattered in keeping them alive. I have been assumed thug, robber, dangerous, stupid, poor and pitiful because of the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is the exact reason it\u2019s funny to me. It is funny in the same way a person with a bullet wound laughs at someone crying about a paper cut. Because a jumbled cacophony of six letters can trigger real cases of butt-hurtedness. Because I imagine the disgust on the faces that hate it. Because ... fuck it, why not?\n\nThere is one thing, however, I will apologize for and readily admit that I regret: I forgot to include \u201cpeople who hate the word \u2018wypipo\u2019\u201d in the tournament bracket.\n\nI would\u2019ve voted for them.\n\nRound 2 of the World Wypipo Tournament begins tomorrow, Thursday.

For this collection, Jean-Raymond collaborated with both Reebok and \u201990s hip-hop brand Cross Colours, leveraging big-brand distribution and recognition for the heavy financial lifting required to bring a fully realized collection to market\u2014and as a vehicle for some seriously good clothes.\n\nThese are clothes that don\u2019t need nostalgia to usher them forward, but instead are forward-thinking in using both patriotism and the Western theme that\u2019s become a dominant trend this New York Fashion Week as a flashpoint for conversation about the current political landscape and how African Americans continue to define the history of this country.\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images 1 / 22\n\nDown the runway came loose button-down shirts paired with stovepipe leather trousers, top-stitched patchwork suits (in a nod to both denim and quilting bees) and elegant, crystal-pleated pants that elevated baggy trousers to a whole new level. Louche and easy-shearling jackets looked perfect over satin slip dresses\u2014and don\u2019t sleep on the block-pleat finish at the hem, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for any designer to make Western wear feel new; generally, it\u2019s either rehash or a costume. For Pyer Moss, designer Jean-Raymond did well to channel Wild Bill Pickett, the early-20th-century black cowboy who invented bulldogging\u2014where rodeo riders literally take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground. That, coupled with the use of a blown-up Stars and Stripes motif on blanket-sized scarves and then again in furry coat linings, seemed both a subversive statement and also a declaration of love for America and all that our country has the potential to be.\n\nSince the label\u2019s inception, Pyer Moss has composed clothes like hip-hop songs\u2014sampling beloved nostalgic influences like Cross Colours\u2014with whom designer Jean-Raymond confirmed to Vogue that a full collection is on the way. Until then, we can swoon over his current collection\u2019s mix of floor-length fun furs over hoodies and joggers for the weekend, and, for the office, patchwork jackets over tuck-pleated, high-waisted pants that give the illusion of chaps.

The answer key is at the bottom.\n\nA Washington state college was deluged with a torrential downpour of low-sodium, gluten-free white tears after butt-hurt white people freaked out when minority students asked for a white-privilege timeout.\n\nBlack and transgender students at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., were fed up with discrimination at the school and staged a protest. According to The Olympian, the protesters issued a statement that read:\n\nWhat started out as anti-black comments on social media has turned into the dismissal of the rights of students and femmes of color, physical violence by police, and false sentencing of students protesting. Black trans disabled students are actively being sought out and confronted by campus police constantly, police are refusing to explain their actions and harassment. Students will not stand for this anymore, as students of color have never felt comfortable on campus and have not been treated equally.\n\nBut it was the students\u2019 call for a \u201cDay of Absence and Day of Presence\u201d demonstration that induced a cacophony of Caucasian crying that eventually dampened the entire campus.\n\nWhen students called for white teachers and students to leave campus for a day, white people on campus: A. Said \u201cHell yeah, a day off!\u201d and left happily\n\nB. Kept playing Hacky Sack\n\nC. Asked for an open and honest dialogue with the minority students to foster better understanding\n\nD. Got butt-hurt\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Bret Weinstein (should we even have to mention that Weinstein is white? For most of my life I thought I knew the only black \u201cBret\u201d in the continental United States, but I later found out his name was Donald, and\u2014because of his childhood affinity for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches\u2014people eventually nicknamed him \u201cBread\u201d) heard about the suggestion and fired off an email to First Peoples Multicultural Adviser Rashida Love. (Should I mention that Rashida Love is\u2014you know what? I don\u2019t think we need to.)\n\nIn the email, Weinstein said that asking white people to leave the campus was \u201ca show of force, and an act of oppression in and of itself.\u201d Weinstein added\u2014presumably through eyes wet with the tears of his oppressed people\u2014that \u201con a college campus, one\u2019s right to speak\u2014or to be\u2014must never be based on skin color.\u201d\n\nWhen the black student protesters heard about the email, they: A. Sat down and remained quiet, knowing that\u2019s how black people have gotten all the rights and freedoms they enjoy\n\nB. Wrote a memo to themselves about their treatment and then gave the memo to a friend to leak to the press so they could snitch to the Senate\n\nC. Cried black tears\n\nD.

We want to give some sense of solidarity and provide safety in and outside of classes.\u201d\n\nWhen Professor Weinstein heard about the student protest, he: A. Explained himself to the students, opening a dialogue and making it a teachable moment\n\nB. Listened intently to the other side of the argument\n\nC. Said, \u201cFuck that thing I previously said about students\u2019 \u2018right to speak\u2014or to be\u2019; I\u2019m gonna take over this conversation, and if they won\u2019t listen to me, I\u2019m gonna call the police\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVincent said the students \u201cwere understandably upset but were not overtly threatening or harmful in any way.\u201d Weinstein tried to take over the conversation, but students began chanting, \u201cThese racist teachers have got to go,\u201d and some of Weinstein\u2019s students surrounded the students of color and verbally attacked them.\n\nThen a campus police officer showed up, followed by the campus police chief, so the students decided to go to the campus square, where state troopers and the Olympia Police Department \u201cbegan to threaten students with mace and arrest.\u201d Eventually the students were dispersed by three police agencies.\n\nWeinstein now says he feels \u201cunsafe on campus, and the conservative press has jumped on the cause, accusing the students of trying to \u201cmurder\u201d Weinstein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, some of the college\u2019s white students have complained that the students of color have gone too far and have created a hostile learning environment by asking them to leave college for a day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the black students were absolutely wrong to suggest that they wanted to live and learn in spaces that excluded other races. The idea that they could stiff-arm an entire group of people simply based on the color of their skin is horrendous. It is indefensible that a group would knowingly place hurdles or barriers that made it harder for a race of people to be employed or receive an education. That is the ultimate symbol of privilege!\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if those black students were acting ... A. White\n\nB. White\n\nC. White\n\nD. All of the above\n\n*Answer key:\n\nThis is America. Black students\u2019 complaints about racism, police presence and discrimination are easily dismissed, but Bret Weinstein is oppressed by 50 black students who do not pay him and have no authority over his employment. White women singing songs at solidarity marches and Ku Klux Klan rallies are expressing First Amendment rights, but protesting a teacher at an institution of higher learning warrants a police presence if you\u2019re black. Law-enforcement officers spreading across campus as a \u201cprecaution,\u201d threatening black people with mace for talking, is understandable, but Weinstein is the one who feels unsafe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is always white fragility.

Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure.

From not wanting to hire people with ghetto names (cough\u2014like hers\u2014cough) to believing that former first lady Michelle Obama does indeed look apish, Raven-Symon\u00e9 may well be a card-carrying member of the sunken place.\n\nBut when she spoke up recently about her former co-star Bill Cosby\u2019s sexual assault allegations, she surprised us all, speaking with eloquence, compassion and the perfect amount of ambiguity.\n\n\n\nWhen asked during an appearance on Thursday\u2019s episode of People Now about whether having to report on Cosby was difficult when she was part of The View panel, Raven said: \u201cThings are going to happen. Tough things are gonna happen. And if my mom and dad and brother are healthy, and people around me are healthy and going through stuff that they can get over eventually, I don\u2019t call it \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018challenging,\u2019 because I try not to internalize it.\n\n\u201cLiving through that moment and knowing that things are ebb-and-flowing at all times, I was hoping the best for the outcome that it needed to be,\u201d she continued. \u201cChalk it up, hope everything\u2019s OK, figure it out on either side. ...\n\n\u201cI am trying to do this show right now, and [Cosby\u2019s case is] going to work it out,\u201d she added. \u201cI want everybody who deserves justice to get justice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, Raven steered clear of giving too much, but she gave just enough. Her statement is far less concerning than that of his other former co-star, and beloved icon, Phylicia Rashad, who said in 2015, \u201cIt\u2019s not about these women\u201d (or \u201cforget these women,\u201d depends on whom you ask). She continued, \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it\u2019s orchestrated. I don\u2019t know why or who\u2019s doing it, but it\u2019s the legacy. And it\u2019s a legacy that is so important to the culture.\u201d\n\nRaven hadn\u2019t been completely mum on the topic before her People Now appearance. In 2014 she used an Instagram post to respond to the various inquiries about whether Cosby victimized her as a child: \u201cI was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!\u201d\n\nA year later, also on The View, when she was asked about Cosby by her then co-workers, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t really like to talk about it that much because he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m on this panel in the first place. He gave me my first job. But at the same time, you need the proof, and then I\u2019ll be able to give my judgment here or there. And now there are real facts. More people can come up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaven-Symon\u00e9 must have taken some media training after all her slip-ups on The View. During the People Now interview, she was asked about sharing her opinions and said: \u201cMost of it is not said. ... I should have just kept my mouth shut, but at the same time, the other side of my head says, \u2018If I wouldn\u2019t have said this, people wouldn\u2019t know who I was or what I stand for, and my voice wouldn\u2019t have been heard ... \u2019\u201d\n\nCheck out the full interview below, in which she opens by laughing with the hosts over how she\u2019s still \u201cdating girls\u201d:", "keywords": ["wouldnt", "speaks", "dating", "girls", "know", "shes", "ravensymon\u00e9", "going", "women", "surprises", "allegations", "dont", "asked", "cosby", "things", "view", "legacy"], "polarity": 0.1728900503290747, "subjectivity": 0.478513356562137},

Now, is a lot of that just a bunch of white tears still crying over a show they think is targeting them? Sure. But\u2014and I\u2019m about to go with an unpopular opinion here\u2014what if Dear White People isn\u2019t the \u201cstay woke\u201d comedy of this era that we\u2019ve all been waiting for?

The result is a show that is barely worth an afternoon binge, when it could have been a classic Netflix and chill.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is \u201cfaux woke\u201d comedy? It\u2019s comedy that is steeped in the politics of black life and pain but isn\u2019t really for black people. Faux-woke comedy goes through great pains to use the black experience to appeal to white allies and not offend their sense of important \u201cwokeness.\u201d There\u2019s money in faux wokeness now, so long as you can sell it to white audiences. (Think of the early work of W. Kamau Bell.)\n\nThese types serve up \u201cblack\u201d consciousness with a creamy foam on top but make sure, if the topics get too thorny (sex, relationships, institutional violence), that they\u2019re there with a hanky for all the allied white tears. By the finale, Dear White People devolves into a hat-tipping, cane-swirling, \u201cRacism, AMIRITE????\u201d instead of giving black viewers (the source of the comedy) real laughter and catharsis.\n\nAny show\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d is shown through contrasting character voices; whoever gets the last word is what the show is really trying to say. Aaron McGruder\u2019s critique of commercialized black culture came by way of Huey calling out Grandpa and Riley on their \u201cnigga moments\u201d in The Boondocks. Michaela Coel calls out racial fetishizing on Chewing Gum by contrasting Conner and Tracey with Ash and his bougie-but-assimilated ex-wife in \u201cReplacements\u201d (season 2, episode 2). Even though Earn is the main character in Atlanta, Donald Glover uses Paper Boi\u2019s realness and Van\u2019s work ethic to expose him for the smug, self-righteous underachiever he really is. In Dear White People, white folks almost always get the last word, either from their mouths or from black folks caping for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe students at Winchester aren\u2019t just characters; they\u2019re ciphers for certain black ideologies. Reggie is black male militancy, Coco is self-loathing but self-aware assimilation, Troy is respectability politics. The strengths and weaknesses of their beliefs are pointed out throughout the show, but what about Sam and, to an equal extent, Gabe, the key relationship that runs throughout the show?\n\n\n\nUnlike Reggie\u2019s, Coco\u2019s or Troy\u2019s behaviors, which are all poked fun at and are contrasted, Sam and Gabe run free, unchecked and unchallenged. Sam\u2019s contention that black activism is burdensome is never challenged by Joelle or Reggie or anybody else on the show. If anything, it\u2019s validated by Gabe constantly reminding her that she can opt out of her blackness by being with him. Gabe is never called out by the main characters for anything he does, no matter how egregious. His feelings are deemed just as important as the actual real-life experiences of black folks on the show. By. Other. Black. People.\n\n\n\nGabe sexualizes Sam from the jump (posting her post-coitus pic on Instagram), privately resents being a minority in black spaces, calls the cops because he feels threatened by an interracial scuffle at a frat party, and publicly requests that Sam attend to their relationship at a meeting to comfort Reggie, who was almost killed by the cops whom Gabe called. Sam blithely basks in her color privilege, which gains her favor with men of color on campus, lies about a relationship that makes her a hypocrite, puts her needs above Reggie\u2019s trauma and, in the climactic scene of the finale, can\u2019t even explain the purpose of protesting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there any contrasting voices to their actions? Does someone provide a counter voice for how black folks really feel? Did Joelle step in to play the conscious Missy Vaughn to Sam\u2019s flaky Lynn Searcy? Nope. Was there a Tim Wise to Gabe\u2019s #Woke Ryan Gosling? Nope. Gabe and Sam get the last word. Worse, in the end, all of the black characters, from Lionel to Joelle to Sam, rush to remind Gabe, and white people like him, that calling the cops was OK and there\u2019s still room for him at the barbecue. It basically takes the previous eight episodes of the show and throws them down a flight of stairs for Gabe\u2019s white feelings.\n\nWorse, in the era of Trump, when nooses are hung on campuses, and blackface parties and email attacks on black students are becoming the norm, Sam has no answer for Kurt\u2019s challenge of \u201cWhat is accomplished by marching?\u201d The white man gets the last word, on love, politics and race, because that\u2019s how the writers feel, too.\n\n\n\nDear White People had a wonderful comedic and dramatic opportunity to talk about the thorny issues of being a black activist while being partnered with a white person, and instead hid from it. Dear White People had all the materials for a funny, complicated look at the limits of white \u201callies\u201d and whiffed. Or even a character study of \u201cRashida Jones vs. Tracee Ellis Ross\u201d performative blackness by biracial activists like Sam. Nope. Dear White People had the chance to validate and legitimize black pain on college campuses and instead made activism look rudderless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaux-woke comedy requires that in the end, jokes about black pain are always sanitized so as not to offend white sensibilities. No matter how powerful the black community\u2019s voices, in the end the writers want you to know that they\u2019ll kneel in the Oval Office and pledge allegiance to white feelings no matter what. Even though Dear White People made me laugh, fight off a thug tear or two, and think, after 10 episodes it also painfully, obviously missed the mark. Dear White People isn\u2019t great comedy or groundbreaking. It\u2019s a faux-comedy love letter to white people written in the letters of black pain.\n\n", "keywords": ["comedy", "dear", "pain", "sam", "white", "thing", "talk", "gabe", "really", "black", "word", "woke", "bothering"], "polarity": 0.06069775132275128, "subjectivity": 0.35128256003256003},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["wanna", "getty", "images", "marvel", "wakanda", "veronica", "style", "styles", "wear", "look", "film", "black", "love", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

Sometimes, the criticism to the criticism goes even further, and racially-tinged epithets like coon, sellout, and negro bed wench are spat in their direction. And then the wagons already circling around the man in question become reinforced with a coat of self-righteous kevlar. They must protect and defend this man from both the racist and the intra-racial attacks on his actions and character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you've been on any predominately Black digital space this year when Lavar Ball or Umar Johnson or Bill Cosby or R. Kelly were discussed, you've undoubtedly seen it. You might have even been surprised by the number of Black people (men and women) willing to die very public and very stupid deaths on the Cosby and Kelly and Ball and Johnson hills. And, you might have been the target of their vehemence.\n\n(Before I continue, just want to make clear that there's a huge difference between what Cosby/Kelly have been accused of doing and Ball/Johnson \u2014 neither of whom, as far as I know, have been accused of heinous crimes. I put them together because they're each very high profile Black men, and the types of criticism aimed at the people who criticize them are similar.)\n\nAs someone who has been on the receiving end of the criticism of the criticism \u2014 just last week, someone on Facebook pointed to a piece I wrote about #TeamLawrence as evidence I'm ghostwriting for the Rothchilds (or something) \u2014 I'll admit that it bothers me. The names themselves don't matter much to me. You call me a coon or a sellout, and I'll shrug my shoulders and bite a pancake. My annoyance is more about their abject lack of self-awareness. While they're accusing us of being anti-Black, they're the ones allowing racial stereotypes to dictate their thoughts and actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo wit, a common response to the criticism of Lavar Ball's ridiculous bombast is that we're trying to sabotage \"the one brotha who's standing up for his kids.\" And the \"rare Black man willing to challenge White people.\" And \"one of the only Black dads out there so active in their kids' lives.\"\n\nBut \u2014 and take this whichever way you want \u2014 Lavar aint special. Yes, his sons are special basketball players. And he has a special, Trumpian gift for shamelessness and self-promotion. But there are hundred of thousands of Black dads who stand up for their sons just like he does. And are willing to challenge White people just like he does. And are just as active in their kids' lives as he is. The only difference between Lavar Ball and literally any Black dad you can find doing Mikan drills with his son or daughter on a YMCA court today is that Lavar has a megaphone. A megaphone we only bother listening to because his sons are great players.\n\nExcusing his fuckshit and defending him as some rare and precious jewel of Black manhood and Black fatherhood implicitly agrees with the worst stereotypes about Black men and Black fathers. That we're so rare that Lavar Ball has to be handled like the Hope fucking Diamond. The same could be said about Umar Johnson. Who's defended like he's The Last Airbender, when I can personally name, right now without Google, (at least) 40 real actual Black men with real actual PhDs who are knowledgable about race and racism and unafraid to confront Whiteness and aren't misogynists and homophobes and haven't used GoFundMe donations to buy Muscle Milk and Bigen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this defense is what happens when you've allowed what the world expects of Black men to exist as your standard. You start believing the hype \u2014 insisting that A Black Man Doing A Thing is so isolated and rarefied that it's worth excusing all the terrible just to preserve the talent. And while this train of thought might possess the veneer of pro-Blackness, it's actually pervasively anti-Black, as the coddling suggests that these men aren't able to be better people. Like it's impossible for us to be talented and not terrible.\n\nAnd yea, it's true that there are countless forces out there actively trying to kill us. Police. Donald Trump. Darth Susans. Office potlucks. And we need as much protection from them as we can get.

Lately, the jujitsu of reverse racism has manifested itself in the ugliest, most virulent form imaginable:\n\nThe word \u201cwypipo.\u201d\n\nIf you look in the comments section anytime the phrase is used on the internet, you will find accusations of racism\u2014even when it is based on actual fact. Apparently, it is OK to make political policy based on an infinitesimally small number of immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries whose citizens have never committed an act of terror on American soil, but pointing out the statistically accurate fact that white people still support Trump is an act of prejudice. If you dare speak of the available data and facts to show the disposition of white America, you, too, can witness the privileged pushback that can be summed up in one statement: \u201cNot me. I\u2019m white, and I\u2019m not like that, therefore you\u2019re just a racist.\u201d\n\nApparently, Donald Trump is a racist.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Sweet Potato Head addressed a joint session of Congress to lay out his agenda for the country. Embedded among his stiff-arming his responsibility as commander in chief, his spectacular plan to create a magical health care system and his continued contorting to pat himself on the back for winning the election was an off-putting, \u201calt-right\u201d dog whistle addressed to one group of Americans:\n\nWypipo.\n\nTrump did not talk to all of the country Tuesday night. He spoke to the conservative-base, middle-American Caucasians with whom his support lies. He didn\u2019t even talk to them. He whispered to them. He talked in hushed tones, hoping that the minorities and underclass didn\u2019t hear him. He gave the most racist speech ever. He gave a speech for white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe he knows that the people he excluded or vilified don\u2019t have the privilege, means or numbers to raise their voices in America\u2019s comments section like wypipo. The people who can\u2019t wait until the end of the year for a health care tax credit can\u2019t send him an angrily worded tweet. The vast majority of \u201cillegals\u201d who work, pay taxes and take care of their families are too preoccupied with survival to act like the pussy-hat-wearers who voted for Hillary and print T-shirts that say \u201cNot This White Woman.\u201d The millions of American Muslims who practice their religion peacefully don\u2019t have the option of showing outrage and pointing out that they aren\u2019t terrorists. The educated black people raising families can\u2019t put their fingers in the president\u2019s face and say \u201cHow dare he\u201d paint them as uneducated criminals.\n\nOnly wypipo can do that. That\u2019s why black people don\u2019t clog up the internet when Trump, Republicans and white America equate poverty, crime and ghettos with being black. It\u2019s why Mexican Americans don\u2019t make a stink when conservatives give a 10-minute applause break for a border wall. It\u2019s why he can denigrate Muslims, Hispanics, black people, the poor and every nonwhite group in front of the people elected to represent this country with no repercussions. If any of those groups lived with the privilege of wypipo, someone would have screamed at Trump when he spoke of the hordes of marauding Mexicans or the lawless Chicago streets. But only a white guy could get away with yelling, \u201cYou lie\u201d during a presidential address.\n\nEven though he was speaking to wypipo, I know that not every single white person supports the orange agenda, just as I do not claim to speak for every black person who uses \u201cthe w-word.\u201d I don\u2019t even speak for every writer at The Root, but for me, the word \u201cwypipo\u201d is a mirror.

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["work", "metal", "adorned", "jewelry", "panther", "women", "think", "feel", "armored", "black", "douriean", "create", "jeweler", "heavy", "designer"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

I\u2019ll drink the juice. I\u2019ll take a nap. I don\u2019t give a damn. [Laughs.] But seriously, I would love for him to play my grandfather in something.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the article was published, headlines sprang up all over the internet condemning Haddish\u2019s remarks as insensitive to Cosby\u2019s accusers and all survivors of sexual abuse and rape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an Associated Press interview Thursday, Haddish clarified that her comments were an attempt at a joke. She explained that she had done over 20 interviews that day and probably reached a little too far trying to conjure up something funny for the interviewer.\n\n\u201cIn every interview you have to be humorous because you\u2019re a comedian. So I was trying to be humorous, and maybe it was not the best joke, but it was a joke,\u201d Haddish said before going on to add: \u201cI\u2019ll work with whomever. I\u2019m not afraid of nobody. Nobody can do anything to me that I don\u2019t allow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith her newfound success, Haddish\u2014who has performed stand-up comedy for years\u2014is probably learning that her ability to convey her message with comic timing and nuance onstage sometimes does not translate to the written word. She is also beginning to realize that as her audience gets bigger, there are more toes to potentially tread on with every step.\n\nTherein lies her dilemma: Her girl-from-around-the-way attitude is the reason she has been given the spotlight. Now that all of the lights are trained on her, should she be forced to suppress the very thing that elevated her to this position?\n\nWhen Haddish clarified her comments about Cosby, she was sitting next to the equally raunchy and hilarious Tracy Morgan. If Haddish is our bamboo-earring-wearing, ride-or-die homegirl, then Morgan is the unfiltered uncle who we gather around at every cookout to hear him tell stories until we have to leave before we throw up from laughing too hard. Haddish is basically Morgan\u2019s younger, female counterpart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2011, Morgan was castigated for going on an \u201canti-gay tirade\u201d during a Nashville, Tenn., comedy show. That\u2019s right. He wasn\u2019t trying to make a joke to a newspaper. He was onstage talking to people who paid to hear him go onstage to make jokes. Earlier this year, Dave Chappelle faced the same backlash when he released a pair of specials that had parts many felt were transphobic and blind to rape culture.\n\nI am not one of those people who rail against the culture of political correctness; nor am I one of those people who believe that \u201cart\u201d is sacrosanct and cannot be criticized. However, I do think it is at least disingenuous and at most stupid to criticize comedians for making jokes when we know it\u2019s a joke.\n\nIt may seem like a fine line to parse, but I separate them from city officials who email Barack Obama memes to each other or cops caught making racist jokes because we pay them to calculate our water bill and patrol the streets. They can make their friends laugh on their own time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving known and followed Haddish\u2019s career for years after meeting her at Los Angeles\u2019 Comedy Store, I am aware that Haddish comes from a group of savage comedians including Leslie Jones, Katt Williams, Ari Shaffir and Joe Rogan\u2019s \u201cDeathsquad.\u201d They are all unapologetic and unafraid to cross any line for the sake of comedy. I once heard her tell someone that the black equivalent of \u201cfiance\u201d was \u201cwe go dagetha.\u201d I\u2019ve loved her ever since.\n\nI can understand when people say they don\u2019t like that brand of comedy (I still don\u2019t understand how Andrew Dice Clay was ever a thing). I can even understand why some people get offended when someone they don\u2019t know says something that has no effect on their lives whatsoever. Even though I wasn\u2019t outraged when Emilia Clarke equated Hollywood sexism with racism, I thought it was a stupid thing to say with a straight face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of comedy is using absurdity and hyperbole to make fun of reality. There are some who prefer to chuckle, but I don\u2019t want to live in a world where sidesplitting jokes are replaced by innocuous puns and clever witticisms. I like the \u201cI might get you pregnant\u201d Morgan. I prefer the Chappelle who dissects white people, crackheads and racism. You can\u2019t get that by making someone dance on the knife\u2019s edge of public sentiment.\n\n\n\nCosby\u2019s alleged crimes are horrendous. Haddish is a product of abuse and dysfunction, and perhaps her ability to make fun of it and situations like the one she escaped is one of the pillars on which her I-don\u2019t-give-a-fuck attitude stands. She explained that it was a joke. That\u2019s enough.\n\nYou can\u2019t fall in love with her for blithely beginning a story with \u201cWhat had happened was ... \u201d on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and turn around and get upset with her when she doesn\u2019t carefully choose her words for a newspaper interview. You can\u2019t ask her to tread gently around sensitive toes and give banana-grapefruit blowjobs in a movie.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze.

After Issa Rae\u2019s Insecure and Russian spies exposed America\u2019s secret white email network last year, we managed to hack into the white server and unearth the email that started the entire Netflix controversy:\n\n\n\nDear Fellow Caucasians,\n\nYesterday I was feeling a little despondent after I discovered I was out of organic, gluten-free mayonnaise, so I decided to cheer myself up by watching something on my favorite streaming service. As I scrolled through the seemingly limitless listings of Caucasian content, I stumbled across a trailer for the upcoming Netflix series Dear White People. I was so appalled by what I saw that I immediately bolted for my safe space, grabbed my pearls, threw them around my neck and clutched them while delicate drops of low-salt, distilled white tears streamed down my face.\n\nAlthough the teaser was an innocuous clip about how distasteful it is when our fellow white people wear blackface on Halloween, I saw it for what it really was: an insult.\n\nIt was symbolic of America\u2019s growing disrespect for the white man. It was reverse racism. I mean, come on. Let\u2019s be realistic\u2014Halloween is a time for fun and fantasy. If we can\u2019t dress and act a little obscene during this one holiday, what holidays will we have left to enjoy the proud history of American racism (besides Columbus Day, Cinco de Mayo, Thanksgiving and Confederate Memorial Day)?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first I considered that I might be blowing things out of proportion, so I jumped on white Twitter to see if anyone else felt the lack of respect. My fears were instantly confirmed when I saw these tweets:\n\nNetflix announced a new anti-white show (Dear White People) that promotes white genocide.\n\n\n\nI cancelled my account, do the same. #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/2HIGqviLHj \u2014 Baked Alaska\u2122 (@bakedalaska) February 8, 2017\n\nIf this is the kind of programing @Netflix wants to partner with, I have no problem cancelling my subscription. #BoycotTNetflix https://t.co/sIC5ypwcYK \u2014 Alex Roltner (@AlexRoltner) February 8, 2017\n\nI\u2019m getting so tired of the ongoing assault against our people. This is the \u201cwhite genocide\u201d we speak of so often. Between the Kardashian sisters crossing the color line and Beyonc\u00e9 popping out babies two at a time, we will be the minority soon! We are slowly losing this great country we stole, and unless we take a stand, it is possible that we will continue losing the privileges our whiteness affords us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what some of you are saying as you read this: Is it really that important?\n\nListen, my alt-right brethren, do you know what we are up against? If we don\u2019t take a stand against these insidious little actions, we might have to face an unthinkable scenario:\n\nEquality.\n\nIs that what you want?\n\nDo you want those people getting the same quality education as you? Do you want your little boys and girls to grow up in a country where they have to work for everything they get? Don\u2019t you see every other week there is an article about some little black kid who slips through the cracks, happens to get a decent education, and gets accepted into an Ivy league school when he or she is still in diapers? Do you know what happens when the playing fields are leveled? Trust me, you don\u2019t want to find out what happens when your white-privilege card is revoked. It\u2019s going to be ugly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure we can just ignore this little incident and be satisfied that 99 percent of the content on Netflix is geared toward our great white race. We could wallow in our complacency and accept the fact that 10 episodes of a television show won\u2019t change the power structure in America.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what we do.\n\nThat\u2019s not the attitude that got us 80 percent of Congress, 44 of 45 presidencies, 45 0f the 50 governors, the Supreme Court, 96 percent of the Fortune 500 CEOs, 500 years of free labor and a country we can call our own, without having to repay nary an acre nor mule. It\u2019s not the attitude that also begat us a urine-colored, tiny-fingered Twitter troll for president, which is the gift that keeps on giving.

We\u2019re fragile! We complain! It\u2019s kind of our thing!\n\nSo boycott Netflix. Turn your subscriptions off. Let them know that we will not stand for being insulted. It may seem small, but we must make ourselves loud enough to drown out a television series that seeks only to highlight the frustrations of underrepresented voices in an entertaining way.

CVS is also asking brands that are sold in its stores to disclose which elements of a model\u2019s appearance have been altered in the ads for products on display.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid moderated a panel that included Matlins, Chief Marketing Officer of CVS Health Norman de Greve, Revlon-endorsed supermodel and body-positive activist Ashley Graham, activist beauty blogger and documentarian Noor Tagouri, and celebrity makeup artist and Honest Beauty spokesman Daniel Martin to discuss how truth in advertising can help alleviate some of the inadequacies we can feel when faced with unobtainable images of beauty presented as reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the issues discussed were how how happiness is tied to expectations, and how well our expectations match reality\u2014or not\u2014in the digital era of filters and \u201cliquify\u201d tools that enhance not only professional but amateur photographs.

A few hours later, Harmon walked into a nearby church bloodied, bruised and discombobulated, wearing nothing but her underwear.\n\nAccording to the Herald-Democrat, Harmon told the police that she was kidnapped by three black males wearing ski masks and gloves. Harmon explained how the roving band of masked thugs, obviously roaming the area looking for white women to defile, snatched the 18-year-old out of her car, took her to a wooded area and gang-raped her.\n\nBut Harmon bravely fended off the imaginary Negroes in an epic knife fight from which she luckily escaped with only a few scratches on her legs. She fled to the church and recounted her story to officers, who began searching for the African rape squad before they could attack another white woman.\n\nThe alleged rape of an innocent white girl angered people in the community and around the country. Everyone began searching for the evil men who stole Harmon\u2019s purity after her mom made a Facebook post:\n\nThis is going to be a brutally honest post. Today my daughter, Breana Harmon Talbott was taken by force by 3 black men. 2 raped her and she is cut head to toe by a knife. They took her engagement ring, her class ring, her earrings, her baby T necklace, everything she had on. She was able to run and ran into a church, bleeding from head to toe with no pants on. Someone had to have saw something!!! This town is small, if anyone, anyone hears ANYTHING, please call the denison police department.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though no one claims to \u201chave saw something,\u201d the alt-right began explaining how they had been warning the world all along about how black men, unable to control their animalistic lust for legal-envelope-shaped Caucasian cakes, often satisfied their savage urges by raping white girls.\n\nSome folks brainstormed solutions for this raging epidemic, posting, \u201cWhites need a mafia \u2026 so if you want to rape a white girl like Breana Talbott the white mafia finds you and your family and puts you down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs police investigated, they wondered why Harmon\u2019s bruises were not consistent with being in a violent knife attack. Even more curiously, a nurse who examined Harmon said that there was no physical evidence of sexual assault, and did not think that she had been assaulted.\n\nAfter police questioned black men in the area and were unable to find the three-man white-girl rape team, Harmon eventually confessed that she might have made up the part about the black men. And the part about being kidnapped. And the part about being raped.\n\nHarmon admitted that she had cut herself and her jeans because she was upset about possibly breaking up with her boyfriend. When she realized that her mom might be upset about the jeans, Harmon said, she just made up the stuff about the group of masked rapists because ... well ... you know\u2014they\u2019re black. I\u2019m sure everyone can understand that siccing the police on black men is less stressful than having Mommy yell for a few minutes about ripping a perfectly good pair of Old Navy dungarees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Harmon pleaded guilty to two third-degree felony counts of tampering with physical evidence, a third-degree felony count of tampering with a government record and a state-jail felony count of tampering with a government record. The charges meant that Harmon faced 30 years in prison and tens of thousands of dollars in fines.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very remorseful for what she did and what she said, and that\u2019s why she decided to plead guilty,\u201d Harmon\u2019s attorney, Bob Jarvis, explained, noting that the plea deal means that Harmon will not serve a day behind bars. \u201cThe cap is either regular probation or deferred adjudication,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll be asking for deferred and they\u2019ll be asking for regular probation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Texas, deferred adjudication means that Harmon will enter a guilty plea, but it will not be listed as a conviction. Upon successful completion of a period of community supervision, the charges against Harmon will be technically dismissed. Furthermore, Harmon will be able to file for nondisclosure after her period of supervision that \u201cessentially seals the criminal record of the offense from private entities,\u201d legal advocate website Avvo states. \u201cThis keeps potential employers, apartment complexes, and many others from knowing about the offense.\u201d\n\nBefore deciding whether or not Harmon receives probation or deferred adjudication, her lawyer plans to present the extenuating circumstances of the case, including some of the things she was going through at the time.\n\nAs of the date of publication, The Root was unable to reach a representative from the mythical masked black rape clique running around Denison, Texas, searching for blondes to desecrate. However, when asked for comment, Emmett Till, the Scottsboro Boys, the Central Park Five and the entire population of Tulsa, Okla.\u2019s Black Wall Street responded:\n\n\u201cWe told y\u2019all.\u201d", "keywords": ["prison", "kidnapping", "deferred", "harmon", "black", "woman", "unable", "zero", "lied", "white", "rape", "denison", "faces", "told", "raping", "texas", "men"], "polarity": -0.013539382309941514, "subjectivity": 0.47150006426322216},

Prepared by her family, education, and personality for a life committed to social justice and peace, she entered the world stage in 1955 as wife of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and as a leading participant in the American Civil Rights Movement. Her remarkable partnership with Dr. King resulted not only in four children, who became dedicated to carrying forward their parent\u2019s work, but also in a life devoted to the highest values of human dignity in service to social change. Mrs. King traveled throughout the world speaking out on behalf of racial and economic justice, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, gay and lesbian dignity, religious freedom, the needs of the poor and homeless, full-employment, health care, educational opportunities, nuclear disarmament and environmental justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar before her time, Coretta Scott King also embodied the rare work-life balance so many of us are still seeking, gracefully managing to mother her four children with Martin while consistently supporting, speaking and creating for the movement\u2014including organizing the series of Freedom Concerts that functioned as vital fundraisers for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

He quickly deduced that the same neighbors must be the authors of the anonymous and now infamous note that escalated a pretty common clash between neighbors into a hostile war of words.\n\nBrookshire\u2019s letter in response has been covered on major news sites, including this one. But just what is it about Brookshire\u2019s letter\u2014aside from the hilarious \u201cread\u201d\u2014that resonates with so many black readers? I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s because in one form or another, we\u2019ve all been there. And not just the \u201cthere\u201d with the annoying neighbors, but there with people, particularly white people, overreacting to perceived slights from black folks.\n\nBrookshire agrees. \u201cBlack people have been dealing with the hypersensitivities of others since forever,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAt work, in college, across New York City all the time. They get what I was going through.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said for his beautiful blend of professional tone and private vernacular, a code-switching to which every black professional can relate. Without knowing Brookshire, black people can read that letter and know his whole story, from the tired frustration to his deep roots in blackness to the way he straddles the line of keeping it corporate\u2014I mean, the letter is written like a memo\u2014and keeping it 100.\n\nBrookshire said that he is very flattered by the positive response thus far, even if a little surprised by some of the reactions. He described himself as an \u201copen book\u201d on social media and said he generally shares a lot about his life. He shared the letter, expecting to be supported by his friends, but never thinking it would go viral. He\u2019s been pleasantly surprised by the responses, especially from the women in his inbox \u201coffering themselves\u201d and asking if he\u2019s single. (He\u2019s not, and cohabitates with his boyfriend.)\n\nAnd while the attention is all well and good\u2014and a nice promotion for his upcoming podcast, Reparations, on iTunes\u2014Brookshire has bigger concerns than internet fame. \u201cThe only intention I had with sharing the letter is that I did not end up shot because my white neighbor had sensitive eardrums,\" he said. \u201cThe viral thing is cool, but I still have to go home at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemetria Lucas D\u2019Oyley is a contributing editor at The Root, a life coach and the author of Don\u2019t Waste Your Pretty: The Go-to Guide for Making Smarter Decisions in Life & Love as well as A Belle in Brooklyn: The Go-to Girl for Advice on Living Your Best Single Life.

Though more than 50 women have accused him of sexual misconduct, his spokesman told Fusion this week that Cosby nevertheless has a great deal to teach people about what he characterized as an epidemic of false sexual assault allegations.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives for Cosby said on a local Alabama television on Wednesday that they\u2019re planning on hosting a string of town hall meetings this summer to educate young people\u2014including married men and male athletes\u2014about how to avoid facing allegations of sexual misconduct. What\u2019s more, Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for the comedian, confirmed to Fusion that Cosby will personally be involved in the sessions, using his own story to caution people against what Wyatt described as the insidiousness of false rape allegations.\n\nWyatt said that, while the planning for the events is still in the preliminary stages, Cosby\u2019s team has received \u201chundreds\u201d of phone calls from churches and civic organizations requesting that Cosby come speak with young people. He declined to name any of these groups, but said calls had come from places like Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Birmingham.\n\n\u201cThese groups felt that so many young people today are caught in those situations, and they thought Mr. Cosby would be a a great person to speak on it because of what he\u2019s dealing with,\u201d Wyatt told Fusion.\n\nHe went on to draw a direct parallel between the case against Cosby\u2014in which one his accusers, Andrea Constand, alleged that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her\u2014to racial disparities in the justice system, where black defendants are more likely to be offered plea deals, more likely to be held in jail before they\u2019re arraigned, and significantly more likely to be incarcerated than white Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the prison system today, it\u2019s populated with black\u2014well more black and brown\u2014because those people had to take deals,\u201d he told Fusion. \u201cWe see every day now, people being released from prison that didn\u2019t commit crimes that they were accused \u2014sexual assault crimes they didn\u2019t commit\u2014because of DNA that wasn\u2019t present at those times.\u201d\n\nNeither physical evidence nor DNA played a role in Constand\u2019s case, which began more than 13 years after she alleges Cosby drugged and assaulted her. Constand was not examined by a doctor after the incident, which Cosby repeatedly maintained was consensual, though he did admit in a deposition related to a civil lawsuit brought by Constand in March 2005 that he gave her Benadryl and also acquired Qualuudes to provide to women he wanted to have sex with.\n\n\u201cWe received so many calls from family members saying, my son, my daughter is going through this situation, but no one\u2019s going to tell that story because they don\u2019t have a recognizable name, and they\u2019re doing time, unnecessary time, because of alleged allegations with no evidence,\u201d Wyatt said. (False rape allegations are statistically rare, and it\u2019s even rarer for a false allegation to end in prison time for the accused.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cImagine, across this county, how many people are going through this situation today,\u201d Wyatt added.\n\nAs Wyatt and Cosby\u2019s attorneys tell it, the comedian was the perfect target for District Attorney Kevin Steele, who ran what Wyatt has characterized as \u201cWillie Horton-style\u201d campaign ads promising to bring Cosby to justice if elected. Wyatt also suggested that the prosecutor was motivated to go after Cosby at least in part by higher political aspirations like joining Donald Trump\u2019s administration. (Steele is a Democrat.)\n\nAlthough Cosby\u2019s legal troubles are far from over\u2014there are still numerous civil cases open, brought by at least 13 accusers in three states\u2014Wyatt emphasized that Cosby is eager to \u201cuse his voice and his celebrity to educate those people on what they should be doing and what they should not be doing.\u201d", "keywords": ["young", "prison", "false", "americas", "inside", "cosbys", "theyre", "face", "sexual", "rape", "cosby", "imaginary", "plan", "wyatt", "crisis", "today", "told", "bill"], "polarity": 0.16355932203389822, "subjectivity": 0.4950766747376917},

It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy. And if that doesn\u2019t work, maybe we just need to buy them some fucking maps.", "keywords": ["youre", "fear", "scared", "control", "theyre", "whitepeople", "doesnt", "problem", "america", "surrounded", "white", "gun", "entire", "black", "ones", "way"], "polarity": 0.07435897435897436, "subjectivity": 0.4387820512820513},

According to a number of the film\u2019s female stars, their characters\u2019 strength is a direct reflection of Wakanda\u2019s cultural history.\n\nBecause of the fictional country\u2019s historical isolationist worldview, a lot of things about Wakanda are vastly different from its neighboring nation states and other international actors. For instance, it\u2019s vast stores of vibranium and the development of fantastical technology. But in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Angela Bassett, who portrays Queen Mother Ramonda, said that Wakanda\u2019s culture is also the reason that Black Panther features so many dynamic women whose nurturing qualities are seen as signs of strength.\n\nActress Danai Guriria, who plays Okoye, further explained that because Wakanda was never invaded or colonized, its culture was predisposed to becoming more egalitarian along gender lines:\n\nThey were a nation uninterrupted. They got to go through their full evolution. Other countries on the continent were very interrupted and traumatized through colonization. Wakanda didn\u2019t have that disruption. It was such an advanced nation, it actually allowed for evolution of gender roles. It recognized that you allow all your citizens to advance to their full potential.\n\nLupita Nyong\u2019o portrays Nakia, a Wakandan spy who periodically slips pasts the country\u2019s airtight borders to collect valuable intel about the wider world around them. Though she\u2019s very much a love interest for T\u2019Challa, Nakia moves through Black Panther with a freedom and flexibility that means she\u2019s never expected to wait around for the king, something that inspired Nyong\u2019o:\n\nIt was such a breath of fresh air seeing men and women living in their power with out one dwarfing the other. To me it was reflective of the fact that sexism is learned. To see a society where that\u2019s not the focal point, where gender is not the fabric with which society is built and the delineations of sex are not oppressive, that\u2019s really cool. And it\u2019s possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EW piece with Black Panther\u2019s leading women also features a video and is chock full of all kinds of fabulous insight into the movie and you should definitely give it a read and watch before the film drops this Friday.

(Photo by Moses Robinson, Getty Images for Usher\u2019s New Look)\n\nIn the fallout of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, companies across the U.S. have been cutting ties with the National Rifle Association. On Saturday, both Delta Airlines and its competitor, United, joined that growing list by announcing they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2 to 10 percent discount? And moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the the airline\u2019s announcement, as RawStory notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law Professor quoted in the RawStory article, said state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nRawStory also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet fuel tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans threatened to pull their support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nThe Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia also responded to Cagle, criticizing the Lt. Governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["loves", "georgia", "casey", "threatening", "biggest", "delta", "tax", "nra", "employers", "states", "hes", "second", "governor", "wannabe", "cagle", "discounts", "state", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.00662589725089725, "subjectivity": 0.36043296980796985},

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark.

A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

On Saturday, both Delta Airlines and its competitor, United, joined that growing list by announcing they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2 to 10 percent discount? And moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the the airline\u2019s announcement, as RawStory notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law Professor quoted in the RawStory article, said state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nRawStory also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet fuel tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans threatened to pull their support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nThe Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia also responded to Cagle, criticizing the Lt. Governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["loves", "georgia", "casey", "threatening", "biggest", "delta", "tax", "nra", "employers", "states", "hes", "second", "governor", "wannabe", "cagle", "discounts", "state", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.00662589725089725, "subjectivity": 0.36043296980796985},

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2 to 10 percent discount? And moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the the airline\u2019s announcement, as RawStory notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law Professor quoted in the RawStory article, said state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nRawStory also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet fuel tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans threatened to pull their support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nThe Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia also responded to Cagle, criticizing the Lt. Governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["loves", "georgia", "casey", "threatening", "biggest", "delta", "tax", "nra", "employers", "states", "hes", "second", "governor", "wannabe", "cagle", "discounts", "state", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.00662589725089725, "subjectivity": 0.36043296980796985},

If there were a Pulitzer for \u201cWriting While Aggressively White,\u201d this passage would definitely be a nominee:\n\nImagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to. Below are the 10 worst (and whitest) things about this idea.\n\n1. It\u2019s slavery.\n\n2. No, seriously. Its slavery.\n\n3. It\u2019s not even slavery-adjacent.\n\n4. Or \u201cslavery-flavored\u201d\u2014which is what I call black licorice.\n\n5. Nah, this is fucking slavery.\n\n6. I mean, it includes the line, \u201cSponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.\u201d So you could, conceivably, pay a migrant in bite-sized Snickers if you chose to. Which would be delicious. But it would be delicious slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cWait,\u201d I hear you asking, \u201care you saying that Politico published a piece in two thousand fucking eighteen arguing for fucking slavery?\u201d\n\n8.

In Pittsburgh alone, there are at least 26 different grades of whiteness, including garden-variety Yinzer whiteness, Appalachian-adjacent whiteness, well-meaning Patagonia whiteness, Lululemon whiteness and Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nAnd sometimes, as in the story about Belen Aldecosea\u2014the Florida woman who, when allegedly told that she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her emotional-support hamster on a plane, allegedly flushed said hamster down the toilet\u2014the levels of whiteness converge to form a whiteness souffl\u00e9. A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster. Hamsters are cute and great and all, but there\u2019s nothing about a hamster that has ever made me think, \u201cI wish that hamster would give me a hug.\u201d This must have been a charismatic-ass hamster. The Mahershala Ali of hamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. The bulk of my adult life has been spent intentionally avoiding enclosed places where rodents might be. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6. The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The fact that she apparently already has a new hamster, one that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also murder when told she\u2019s not allowed to co-sign a loan for it.\n\n9. The fact that SOMEONE SOLD ANOTHER HAMSTER TO AN INFAMOUS HAMSTER MURDERER. Niggas go to prison for 50 years for stealing Snickers Ice Cream Bars, and this known hamster murderer gets help.\n\n10. The fact that her name is Belen Aldecosea, but what happened is so white that for now on I\u2019m just going to call her Kirstjen Nielsen.", "keywords": ["told", "emotionalsupport", "shes", "gotdamn", "whiteness", "plane", "hamster", "im", "woman", "whitest", "levels", "things", "airport", "bring", "toilet", "fact", "flushed"], "polarity": 0.0061110247776914465, "subjectivity": 0.533083916083916},

He\u2019s reading Sojourner Truth\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t I A Woman?\u201d speech to his daughter and she can\u2019t believe northern black folk speak with such intrepidity. \u201cAche\u201d borrows Truth\u2019s words, dissecting the anatomy of not only the physical strength of black women but the emotional and mental mettle required to endure chattel slavery. The episode, directed by Anthony Hemingway who is one of the executive producers on the show, requires us to wallow in the suffering Rosalee and Ernestine experience for much of the episode, rewarding us with small moments of hope mostly presented in flashbacks between the two. Special shout-out to Angela Bassett who makes a cameo appearance this episode in a flashback scene with a young Ernestine. Does the woman ever age? No. The answer is no she does not.\n\nRosalee is still on the run from Patty and her gang. A very pregnant Jurnee Smollett-Bell delivers an Emmy-worthy performance this episode as she survives getting shot, having to remove the buckshot, cauterizing the wound in the most MacGyver way possible, leeches, a fistfight, digging herself out of her own grave and being bitten by a damn rattle snake. Let\u2019s be real, folks. When Hollywood gives us a character enduring through the unendurable like Rosalee did this episode they usually write the part for a white man. And then that white man, like Leonardo Dicaprio in The Revenant or Daniel Day Lewis in Every Daniel Day Lewis Movie Ever usually goes on to collect all the awards and a nice big salary increase. Smollett-Bell is doing a wonderful job on the small screen and she turns in a performance that warrants movie producers attention now. Not merely once she\u2019s put in a number of years a la Viola Davis.\n\nMiles away at the Gullah plantation, Ernestine is still battling with the ramifications of her decision last week with Hicks and Clara\u2019s pregnancy. The elder tradition of publicly shaming the unwed mother into naming the father is hard for Ernestine to watch so she goes back to dosing herself like Snuffy in Crooklyn. In fact, she\u2019s hitting the smelling salts so hard that it even gives her physically abusive, cheating, co-dependent boyfriend pause. They are both due to sing at the master\u2019s house later that day and he\u2019s sick of covering for her because she can\u2019t keep it together. She counters that going over to the master\u2019s house is even more reason to turn on, tune in and drop out. I\u2019m sure that will work out just fine.\n\nPatty and her biographer are conspiring to build up the legend of the \u201cBlack Rose\u201d and her supernatural strength to sell books and excuse how utterly inept she and her team are at actually catching slaves. Nothing like ignoring the humanity of others to excuse your own sub-human treatment of a group of people. So glad America learned to stop \u201cothering\u201d the black woman. Oh, wait! Patty LaFail allows the public to further her tall-tale about holding a black baby\u2019s face to the fire in order to get some intel from the parents in an effort to create some almost-biblical mystique and I would really appreciate it if she could just fall boob-first into the open mouth of the nearest volcano. At least we\u2019re spared any scenes this week of Elizabeth Hawkes being butthurt because her runaway slave friends can\u2019t make it to her husband\u2019s funeral\u2026on account of them being slaves who are currently running away. Darth Beckalas, I tell ya!\n\nOver at the master\u2019s house Hicks is strumming a tune on his banjo while a couple of Brock Turners discuss the difference between slavery and bondage. Bondage represents a duality, a double-edged sword that maims not only the attacked but the attacker. Cool story, bruh. I\u2019ll just be over here holding my breath waiting for whiteness to stop acting barbaric to people of color. Ernestine enters the room and begins to sing a lovely song about a white guy on a tall mountain when suddenly she starts breaking dishes and spitting the hot fire. I had the same face I had when I listened to ShETHER for the first thirty-seven times. Sadly (or maybe similarly) \u2018Stine\u2019s song has nothing to do with female empowerment. She\u2019s just a wholly broken woman and I wanted so much in that moment to just embrace her and build her back up. Back at the slave quarters, Hicks lays into Ernestine about her display earlier. Harsh words turn into fists with the final blow only stopped by her pleading for him to finish the job. The toxicity of their relationship mutates into desire and they quickly switch gears as Hicks opts to give Ernestine la petite mort instead. Iyanla, fix this mess!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe travel back to a young Ernestine, a yet unsullied girl, free from the misogyny, racism and misogynoir of her era. She is seeking out the mentorship of our guest star who owns a particular set of skills. Bassett isn\u2019t on the screen for long but she puts in one hell of a performance as an elder woman in the community who knows a thing or two about the \u201cbirth control\u201d of their time. Young Ernestine is already aware of the power that her body holds and how that power is seen as a threat to just about every man around her, white or black. Her hope is to harness it to her benefit however Bassett educates her that women have been trying to find a way to take back our power since Eve ate that apple and, \u201cYour body ain\u2019t never been yours, and never will be.\u201d Welp.\n\nThe generational curse of suffering for black women has been front and center, be it the emotional rollercoaster that ultimately pushes Ernestine to attempt to end her own life or the physical hurdles Rosalee must jump through which lead her to a moment of defeat. But as one of the Gullah elders explains to Ernestine earlier in the episode, \u201cthe pain you feel thrives on isolation.\u201d Rosalee is strong because she was raised by a strong woman who was intelligent enough to prepare her for the darkness of the world while reminding her that as we draw close to each other for inspiration, for hope, that we can weather any storm. \u2018Stine currently has the community of Gullah slaves to lean on as they drag her back to the shore from the waters and Rosalee will be okay for now with the help of a horse and wagon right when she needed it the most.\n\nJordan Kauwling is an early thirties Philadelphian but she tells everyone she's in her late thirties because she doesn't understand how math works.

On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2 to 10 percent discount? And moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the the airline\u2019s announcement, as RawStory notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law Professor quoted in the RawStory article, said state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nRawStory also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet fuel tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans threatened to pull their support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nThe Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia also responded to Cagle, criticizing the Lt. Governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["loves", "georgia", "casey", "threatening", "biggest", "delta", "tax", "nra", "employers", "states", "hes", "second", "governor", "wannabe", "cagle", "discounts", "state", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.00662589725089725, "subjectivity": 0.36043296980796985},

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["rick", "school", "yes", "nra", "gov", "enforcement", "trump", "scott", "health", "gun", "ranks", "celebrate", "proposed", "law", "mental", "shouldnt", "florida", "weapons"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

Today, however, I had a meeting there at noon and was able to chop it up with her for a bit afterwards.\n\nAfter we went through today's standard Black person conversation topic, we eventually segued to something a bit lighter than the televised execution of unarmed Black people. Brangelina's breakup. Whether this news was a surprise. (It wasn't.) If it's even worth it to break up with someone when you have six kids. (It's not. To quote Cardi B, we have six kids, we together\u2026foreva.) And, if the rumors about Brad's infidelity are true, if an affair with Marion Cotillard is worth it. (No and yes. No, because affairs are wrong and shit. But yes because Marion Cotillard is Marion Cotillard.)\n\nI then joked about whether we'd be able to make it through the day with this heart-wrenching news.

That said, if this were to ever happen, it would free Stedman up to achieve his destiny.

Maybe Barack and Michelle represent #lifegoals, but Courtney and Angela are definitely my #dictiongoals.\n\nMacaroni and Cheese\n\nYeah, I know. Neither Macaroni nor Cheese is an actual person. But just imagine how devastated we'd collectively be if they decided not to be seen in public together anymore? If they were just tired of putting on the act for so long and needed some space. Of course, it would be Cheese's fault. Because Cheese is a flirt with unlimited options. And the introverted Macaroni just has\u2026tomato sauce sometimes? So we'd all take Macaroni's side. Which would cause Macaroni to get some confidence, hit the gym, and start getting together with other foods, like Kale and Beets. And we'd be happy for Macaroni outwardly, while silently thinking \"Damn, Mac. That's not a good look at all.\" And then Cheese would make this big public spectacle to get Macaroni back, promising fidelity and more attractive low calorie options.

If only Kyrie would take some notes.\n\nThe Deltas and Elephants\n\nI'm not quite sure if Elephants would miss The Deltas that much. The Deltas on the other hand would need to buy new wardrobes, pillowcases, screensavers, license plates, iPhone cases, silverware, thongs, wedding figurine themes, refrigerator magnets, throw pillows, place mats, sweaters, socks, sweatpants, NuvaRings, knitting kits, emoji, stationary, dildos, picture frames, tattoos, cup holders, backpacks, Halloween costumes, and awkward daydream protagonists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDenzel and Pauletta\n\nNo one is really thinking about Denzel and Pauletta's marriage all like that.

Given the amount of heat the trailer packs, you\u2019re likely to be feeling at least 75% more parched once it\u2019s done.\n\nThe world Bradbury imagines, and which we can see replicated in the trailer, is one where books have been outlawed and \u201cfiremen\u201d are responsible for eradicating them through (you guessed it) fire.\n\n\n\nJordan stars in the film as fireman Guy Montag, who starts having doubts about his job and the order he lives in. His mentor-turned-nemesis is played by the perennially evil Michael Shannon. Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2019s Laura Harrier, Sofia Boutella and Lily Singh also star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarenheit 451 will come to HBO in May.", "keywords": ["jordan", "michael", "villainous", "upcoming", "boyfriend", "hbos", "fireman", "doubtful", "play", "b", "film", "hotep", "trailer", "youtubethe", "hbo", "451"], "polarity": 0.07972222222222222, "subjectivity": 0.5183333333333333},

On Saturday, both Delta Airlines and its competitor, United, joined that growing list by announcing they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2 to 10 percent discount? And moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the the airline\u2019s announcement, as RawStory notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law Professor quoted in the RawStory article, said state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nRawStory also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet fuel tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans threatened to pull their support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nThe Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia also responded to Cagle, criticizing the Lt. Governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["loves", "georgia", "casey", "threatening", "biggest", "delta", "tax", "nra", "employers", "states", "hes", "second", "governor", "wannabe", "cagle", "discounts", "state", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.00662589725089725, "subjectivity": 0.36043296980796985},

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much. It would be an entirely stupid and MORE dangerous offering than attempting to make it harder to get guns in the first place. But I guess lawmakers and presidents like to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWhile I know the NRA probably thinks that arming everybody is the best way to make sure fewer people get shot\u2014logic be damned\u2014I\u2019d hope that more levelheaded people would realize that teachers are there to teach, not to be an armed line of defense.\n\nOtherwise students like Chris, who need suspension or detention, could get buried instead.", "keywords": ["teacher", "teachers", "student", "school", "day", "going", "policy", "arming", "class", "shit", "chris", "students", "probably", "worst", "suggestions"], "polarity": 0.0061076817558299076, "subjectivity": 0.4876464824612973},

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed. And they\u2019ll probably be scanning for a teacup to smack out of your hands.", "keywords": ["tell", "khalid", "person", "random", "ive", "black", "telling", "woman", "look", "white", "man", "airports", "probably"], "polarity": -0.01694444444444445, "subjectivity": 0.4044642857142857},

I only knew about what I saw growing up in the hood, so I went and hung out with my folks on Vermont Avenue and decided to figure out this story. That\u2019s where this came from\u2014me trying to make an identity for myself as a filmmaker repping Los Angeles, and using a certain part of L.A. as an identity.\u201d\n\nThat coming-of-age story about three teenagers\u2014Tre, whose unmarried parents are zoned in on his success; his best friend, Ricky, a football standout; and Ricky\u2019s drug-dealer brother, Doughboy\u2014in South Central Los Angeles opened July 12, 1991. At the time, urban communities across the country were grappling with alarming gang violence and staggering homicide rates mainly brought on by young black men killing one another. For many, rap music was the only insight into the violence that fed news headlines. In fact, Singleton told Black Tree TV, which filmed its own anniversary tribute in early January, \u201cThe movie for me was kind of like a rap album on film. Just like the rappers were speaking out in music, that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nSingleton didn\u2019t take the braggadocio approach of showing drug dealers living out Scarface and The Godfather fantasies or showing the stress that cops endure in such tough circumstances as some other films did. Boyz was different. It took audiences into the world of South Central L.A., which also produced young men like Singleton, and it was eye-opening.\n\n\u201cAt the time, drive-bys and this horrible black-on-black crime was just everywhere, and nobody was really talking about it until John made this movie,\u201d Stephanie Allain, the diverse voice at Columbia Pictures who championed the film she would go on to produce, tells The Root. \u201cIt basically changed the world. It changed the neighborhood. It changed the perception of the kids in the neighborhood. It changed people\u2019s perceptions about black people in general.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of that was fully on display at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival in France, where the film premiered and was given a standing ovation. When the time Boyz opened in the United States, it made a huge impact, one that even the Oscars recognized. Singleton became the first black director and the youngest ever nominated for Best Director, plus he was nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Twenty-five years later, the impact of his Hollywood debut is still being felt, which is why the Oscar-granting Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hosted two anniversary screenings in Los Angeles and New York City in June.\n\n\u201cThe reason the movie has stayed so relevant is because the writing was so specific and so true,\u201d says Allain. \u201cThose characters were so real. The actors that we cast were amazing, as they\u2019ve all gone on to stardom. The honesty with which he shot that film as a first-time director, really bringing his voice to the screen, was so palpable and so real, and it will live on forever.\u201d\n\nThose amazing actors\u2014Cuba Gooding Jr. (Tre), Nia Long (Tre\u2019s girlfriend, Brandi), Morris Chestnut (Ricky), Ice Cube (Doughboy), Angela Bassett (Tre\u2019s mother, Reva), Laurence Fishburne (Tre\u2019s father, Furious), Regina King (Doughboy\u2019s friend, Shalika) and Tyra Ferrell (Ricky and Doughboy\u2019s mom, Mrs. Baker)\u2014have gone on to even bigger and better things on the big and small screens over the years, but for many of them, Boyz was the main catalyst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film did a lot for black actors and actresses, Chestnut told Black Tree TV: \u201cIt made Hollywood take notice that there\u2019s some real talent out there that is just untapped.\u201d\n\nBoyz also derived power from the fact that, like Singleton, many of the actors were personally tied to South Central. \u201cI knew what it was like to go home from school and hear gunshots at night,\u201d Long shared in the academy\u2019s L.A. program, moderated by film critic Elvis Mitchell.\n\nIce Cube admitted to Black Tree TV that he underestimated the larger impact Boyz would have, precisely because the story hit so close to home. \u201cI knew everybody on my street would love it. Hollywood? Not so sure,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody was doing movies like this about Los Angeles, how we grew up. Colors is one thing. This ain\u2019t it,\u201d Ice Cube explained. \u201cThis is a movie that\u2019s not telling you how bad it is to be a [f\u2014king] cop. This is telling you how bad it is to be in the hood and be innocent and trying to survive.\u201d\n\nIce Cube later realized that Singleton had unlocked something truly revelatory. \u201cJohn came at the perfect time with a different perspective of something that we all wanted to know about,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants to know what goes on in the neighborhood that makes one kid do the right thing, one kid do the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nFishburne, probably the film\u2019s most seasoned cast member, understood the film\u2019s power from the very beginning. \u201cThe idea that you had three young men who are living in an environment where every day their lives are potentially at risk,\u201d he told Black Tree TV, \u201cthat\u2019s human.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor King, who was best-known as sweet Brenda in a completely different hood in 227 and who reinvented herself in Boyz as the edgy Shalika, Boyz\u2019s universal appeal is simple. \u201cYoung people, kids, in broken neighborhoods, that\u2019s a worldwide thing,\u201d she told Black Tree TV.\n\nHowever, it was only after the film opened and the Academy Awards nominations rolled in, Gooding admitted to Black Tree TV, that he realized how big \u201ca statement film\u201d Boyz was.\n\nGil Robertson, a founder and head of the African American Film Critics Association, which celebrated the film\u2019s silver-anniversary milestone in February, believes \u201cBoyz n the Hood has stood the test of time in a way that other films that are part of that genre have not. That doesn\u2019t in any way diminish the merit of those other films,\u201d he tells The Root. \u201cBoyz was just an important film.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Robertson, \u201cThe presence and success of Boyz n the Hood created a shift in the film and television industry\u201d that is still felt now. \u201cThe success not only launched Singleton\u2019s career but also opened the door for a number of other up-and-coming black directors to begin their careers,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Robertson, however, measuring the impact of Boyz through other films isn\u2019t even necessary. All that is required is to look at Singleton\u2019s \u2014which includes Rosewood, Poetic Justice, 2 Fast 2 Furious and two upcoming television shows\u2014and the careers of Boyz\u2019s primary cast. \u201cEvery one that was in that film in a principal role has gone on to have a successful career and a meaningful career,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo it was special.\u201d\n\nRonda Racha Penrice is a freelance writer living in Atlanta.

Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["watching", "movie", "wakanda", "opening", "panther", "women", "went", "live", "thing", "film", "world", "black", "forever", "night", "love"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["church", "movie", "does", "negro", "reasons", "magical", "mother", "mr", "magically", "shit", "negrod", "white", "charlie"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Namely, the moment when Bernadine Harris, played by \u201cmy triceps will always be fleekier than yours so stop trying\u201d Angela Bassett, slaps the everloving mayonnaise-ridden existence out of that white woman.\n\nIt\u2019s a five-second scene in a movie with an over 2 hour runtime, but it manages to pack in so much power. I mean that literally as well - can you imagine getting a hot one to the face from Angela Bassett? That woman eats pushups for breakfast. The left side of ole\u2019 Becky\u2019s face must\u2019ve been redder than a Fuji apple with the force of that backhand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut beyond the physical impact, that quick scene can run through a whole gamut of reactions through the lens of that incident.\n\nFirst, you feel bewilderment: Did she just slap that white woman?? She really slapped that white woman! She slapped that white woman and kept on moving!\u201d\n\nAfter your brain processes that magnitude of what just happened, empathy follows: White women always just butting in when no one asked them too huh. That trifling woman knew she was doing the most but still had to be a nosy ass Nancy. Well girl that\u2019s what ya get. You start meddling outside your lane you might just get slapped into the next time zone. Mmhm\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally comes the envy: Mannnnn Carol gets on my nerves every damn DAY at the office. What I wouldn\u2019t GIVE to introduce her to my black hand side one time. Just once!\n\nNext thing you know you\u2019re playing a ten second clip over and over and clapping with glee at Bernadine Harris\u2019 fucks to give being more absent than contraceptives at Peter Gunz\u2019 house.\n\nThis scene is truly a gem, and I call on it to lift me up and when times are hard and white women are trying it. Whether it is the one who was told by AppleCare, or the one who claims that Oscars are racist against Whites, or any one of the million and on times that so-called feminists pretend that black women don\u2019t exist, I can live vicariously through Bernadine\u2019s rage. Through Bernie, I can respond to the umpteenth passive aggressive email without losing my marble.

Her job as a mouthpiece for the NRA is to shift the focus from looking at gun laws to looking at anything but gun laws.\n\nSeriously, she doesn\u2019t care if the focus goes from the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to the county sheriff\u2019s department, which she tried to accomplish during a CNN town hall. She doesn\u2019t care if the focus shifts to the FBI, the students or even the media, as long as it isn\u2019t on the NRA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s her job and she\u2019s doing it well. Because Loesch isn\u2019t just a paid talking head; she\u2019s a gun-loving nut, and I say this with all due respect.\n\nAccording to CNN, she\u2019s authored a book called Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America, in which she focuses on the history of the Second Amendment and explains what \u201cgun confiscation would mean to Americans\u2019 basic rights as citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd she even has a tattoo on her right forearm of a biblical verse from the book of Ephesians that is a call to Christians to \u201cput on the full armor of God\u201d in order to protect themselves from evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep. So it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Loesch said some really crazy shit.\n\n\u201cMany in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,\u201d Loesch said Thursday. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that you love the tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back [of the room].\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd notice I said \u2018crying white mothers,\u2019 because there are thousands of grieving black mothers in Chicago every weekend, and you don\u2019t see town halls for them, do you?\u201d Loesch asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s the CNN town hall for Chicago? Where\u2019s the CNN town hall for sanctuary cities?\u201d\n\nAt this point, it would have been nice if someone from \u201clegacy\u201d media had snatched the microphone from Loesch and ordered the entire CPAC evacuated so that Loesch could have had her choice of several seats.\n\nSeriously, the Chicago gun thing is just a tired cacophony of racist dog whistles the NRA blows whenever there is a push to change gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root staff writer Michael Harriot explored the Chicago gun issue in an article last year:\n\nWe know that crime rates in Chicago are on par with those of most major cities in America\u2014until you factor in gun violence. When they try to figure out why cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York don\u2019t have as many gun deaths as Chicago, they point the finger at gangs and \u201cthugs\u201d and ignore the elephant in the room: the state of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws. Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA. In fact, Chicago ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nDoing what?\n\nMoving away from the issue at hand and trying to prove a point that has nothing to do with the actual topic, which is that kids were killed in Parkland because an 18-year-old can buy an assault rifle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamn, she\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s how the NRA continues to shift the argument from guns to bump stocks. It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media. It\u2019s how the NRA makes a story about a mass shooter and how easy it was to get his hands on several weapons into a story about Chicago gun violence.\n\nDon\u2019t be tricked, America, and by \u201cAmerica,\u201d I mean all of us who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. This is a long con game that\u2019s rolled out whenever a shooting happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will say anything to take the focus off guns, and I know it seems low, even for the NRA, to argue that the media loves crying white mothers just days after a tragedy, but nothing is off the table when it comes to preventing Congress from changing gun laws, and this performance from the soulless and deranged Dana Loesch is proof.", "keywords": ["loves", "media", "mothers", "loesch", "shes", "ratings", "town", "shootings", "nra", "mass", "gold", "white", "gun", "chicago", "spokeswoman", "love"], "polarity": 0.06412649850149849, "subjectivity": 0.4381139693639693},

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["enemies", "know", "work", "flight", "going", "need", "speak", "im", "dont", "white", "allies", "world", "airport", "men"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call.

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["far", "school", "douglas", "right", "reform", "stoneman", "theories", "parkland", "gun", "aide", "students", "used", "state", "shooting", "survivors", "seeking", "fla"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people.

I also believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides us the right to gun ownership, and there is a need for commonsense gun legislation.\n\n\n\nI believe in the right to vote, but recognize that I must register and provide proof of identity. I believe in freedom of assembly, but I know that I can\u2019t organize a parade on the busiest intersection of my city without a permit. Every right afforded by the Constitution is regulated. While this may seem obvious, I point this out because someone will inevitably raise the idiotic argument that the ultimate goal of anyone in favor of gun control legislation is to kick in your door, snatch your weapons, drink the last bit of Kool-Aid and eat the big piece of chicken.\n\nAfter the most recent mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. (which may not be the most recent by the time I finish this sentence), some have theorized that one way to force gun control is to pit the intersecting groups in the Venn diagram of conservatism against each other. The argument is, if black people started purchasing firearms in bulk, conservative racists (or is it \u201cracist conservatives\u201d? I get confused sometimes) might get so outraged at the thought of gun-toting Negroes that racism might overwhelm their natural predilection for firearms and cause them to support gun-reform laws.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. I\u2019ve even said it before. White men have always been afraid of armed black people. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed, in part, because during Reconstruction, the South was inundated with newly formed groups dedicated to disarming blacks. The most famous of these organizations was a fraternity of men who called themselves the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Gov. Ronald Reagan fought for gun control legislation after another group of black men called Black Panthers marched on California\u2019s Capitol carrying shotguns. California\u2019s Mulford Act eventually became the blueprint for the Gun Control Act of 1968, the law banning felons from owning firearms and outlawing Saturday night specials, cheap handguns associated with black communities.\n\nThis makes the math seem simple: If black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation. While no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America\u2019s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won\u2019t work.\n\nWhen people talk about commonsense gun legislation, we wrongly assume that rank-and-file Republican voters are against it. However, 70 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of all Americans favor banning assault-style weapons, according to an October 2017 Gallup Poll. A 2016 CNN poll (pdf) showed that 92 percent of white people favored universal background checks, and 89 percent of whites favored stopping felons and people with mental health issues from owning guns.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the prevailing narrative would have you believe that gun owners are against gun reform, they are not. There is only one entity preventing legislative gun reform, and it is not Republicans, white people or even gun owners.\n\nIt is the National Rifle Association.\n\nTo be clear, it is not the members of the NRA who oppose gun control. Data from Pew research shows that the majority of NRA members are in favor of universal background checks, closing gun-show loopholes and preventing the mentally ill from purchasing weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the NRA boasts 4.5 million members (a dubious claim that most researchers don\u2019t believe), the NRA\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t come from its member rolls. The organization\u2019s power comes from its ability to lobby lawmakers, essentially bribing them with barrels of cash. More important, the stacks of money don\u2019t come from dues; they come from gun manufacturers.\n\nThe reason there is not gun reform is that the NRA is not the mythical nationwide coterie of gun nuts that most people would have you believe. It represents gun manufacturers, and gun manufacturers wouldn\u2019t care if black people bought guns. In fact, they\u2019d love it.\n\nFor instance, there are millions of people who donate to the NRA who have no idea they are doing so. Sturm, Ruger manufactured more than 1.6 million guns in 2017 and gave $1 to the NRA every time it sold a firearm. The Taurus company buys a year\u2019s membership for every person who purchases one of its guns, about 92,000 in 2012, according to Shooting Industry. There are shooting ranges across the country that include an NRA membership in the cost of their visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are millions of Nation Rifle Association members who have no idea they are in the NRA! Advertising, sponsorships and corporate donations account for most of the money received by the NRA. Less than half of the money the NRA rolls out to purchase the souls of politicians in exchange for the blood of children comes from membership dues.\n\nBecause of this, the NRA is not beholden to its rank and file. It has become the lobbying wing of the gun industry, and there is only one thing stronger than racism in America:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed.\n\nThe prospect of black people armed to the teeth is actually a good thing for the NRA because it is the de facto supplier of America\u2019s addiction. Thinking that the NRA will ever be concerned about a 12-point rise in African-American gun ownership (the increase that would raise black gun ownership to 36 percent, the same as whites) is like expecting the cigarette industry to care about a rise in black smokers. It just means more money for them.\n\nEven if most white people were racists who were scared shitless because black people started buying AR-15s, the NRA would care as much about that as it cared about dead first-graders in Newtown, Conn., or high school freshmen in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nSo, yes, black people should exercise their right to gun ownership for a number of reasons. But doing so won\u2019t cause the NRA to stop its war against children, no matter how racist or fragile white America may seem.\n\nSadly, two things can be true at the same time.", "keywords": ["money", "theres", "buy", "believe", "control", "nra", "war", "right", "ownership", "stop", "wont", "nras", "white", "gun", "theory", "black", "guns", "kids", "members"], "polarity": 0.04240483654276759, "subjectivity": 0.489879832810867},

After an hour and a half, I emerged with a tiny Egyptian cross etched between my least favorite parts of my body\u2014my breasts. It was a daily reminder not to ignore them and to finally start to embrace them. It\u2019s safe to say I felt like Rihanna standing in the bathroom mirror post-shower, angling my phone to take the ever popular \u201csexy bathroom-mirror\u201d pic. That picture is also still in my phone.\n\n\n\nThe few times I attempted to post it on Instagram, or TwitPic it, I decided against it. Truthfully, I was afraid. I feared that after posting, I would certainly be called a thot or receive a few \u201cR U OK?\u201d text messages. I convinced myself that I didn\u2019t have to be the needy millennial stereotype that uses social media to seek validation. I was convinced that my photo would be labeled just another thirst trap that served no other purpose than to call attention to myself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if we define body positivity as a movement dedicated to embracing all bodies, we aren\u2019t always talking about the ones fully clothed. What you send to future bae or post online on a Thirst Trap Thursday is a form of activism. Yes, activism. This is also why we need thirst traps online; they help shape a more inclusive narrative about body positivity and can inspire other women of color to act in ways that are liberating on their terms.\n\nCollectively, we\u2019ve been trained to believe that openly sexual women pose a threat to social movements and, therefore, should be kept separate. This is why you are more likely to see people call Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBad Blood\u201d video a feminist battle cry and write off Nicki Minaj\u2019s opinion on why \u201cAnaconda\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards as divisive. Minaj critiqued how black women\u2019s bodies are hypersexualized or shamed, but the focus was how she chose to address it. However, it is women like Minaj and Amber Rose who push the envelope enough to start the right conversations.\n\nWhen a woman isn\u2019t so famous, their nudes may not get the same level of admiration that fame grants. But with a simple search of body-positive hashtags like #CelebrateMySize, you can find solid examples of why activism can and should be provocative. Not only did this hashtag tackle body positivity in a very personal way, but many women posted photos of themselves that could easily be posted on a #WCW or be considered a thirst trap.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider sex coach and advocate Tyomi Morgan. By simply embracing her body, she\u2019s empowering and teaching others how to do the same:\n\nBut according to Morgan, there is a clear difference between a thirst trap and body positivity. In a brief email, she defined thirst trap as \u201c[a] photo or post that is placed on one\u2019s social media page with the intention of eliciting a response from potential partners or paying patrons.\u201d However, a thirst trap\u2019s ability to pull people in is how Morgan creates dialogue about sensuality.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very aware of how people are drawn in by the naked body, and I use my posts as a way to grab attention, and once I have it, I follow up with a meaningful message with the intent of enlightening, inspiring and encouraging,\u201d she said.\n\nTo Melanie Ennis, the term \u201cthirst trap\u201d is \u201cdripping with misogyny\u201d because it is usually used as a tool to shame women online. Ennis viewed the difference between a thirst trap and a body-positive post as being more about our inability to accept women\u2019s liberation on their terms.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re taught that one is acceptable and one isn\u2019t. I think the difference between the terms is if I love my body and share it (whether I note that in the caption or not) I can\u2019t help what the viewer thirsts after,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor marginalized women, Twitter and Instagram are spaces to discuss and dismantle layers of oppression, but those women need space and acceptance to do it on their terms. And users like Ennis and Morgan are using these spaces to embrace their bodies regardless of what others deem \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said Ennis. \u201cI do believe we are existing in a special time, and social media has a lot to do with black women being able to share our beauty, on our own terms with each other and the world.\u201d\n\nUltimately, what demotivates women trying to explore self-acceptance and liberation is slut-shaming and respectability politics. So any time a black woman has the confidence to post the most intimate parts of herself online, that is a public declaration of self-love and resistance. Instead of shaming that woman for her approach, be honest with yourself about why it annoys you or makes you uncomfortable.\n\n", "keywords": ["online", "women", "positivity", "post", "ennis", "trap", "body", "thirst", "traps", "morgan", "social", "positive"], "polarity": 0.1580094537815126, "subjectivity": 0.5149439775910365},

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["organization", "terrorist", "nra", "right", "directly", "nras", "second", "dont", "gun", "legal", "deaths"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated. Even though Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan has repeatedly warned me never to trust men with bangs, if I saw these motherfuckers in line at Target, I\u2019d call the 911 immediately.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in racial profiling, but if the operator asked me what was wrong, I\u2019d tell him or her: \u201cLook, I know these white people have someone chained up at the crib. I can just feel it!\u201d\n\nBut back to the fascinating plot of Taken 2: Wypipo Boogaloo.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a 17-year-old daughter of the Turpins escaped from her shackles, slipped out of a window and dialed 911 on a cellphone that had been deactivated. When she met authorities, she showed them pictures of her brothers and sisters who were being held captive by her parents, according to the Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Department looked at the girl\u2019s cellphone photos and decided to perform a welfare check on the home. When officers arrived at the Perris, Calif., home, they discovered 12 of the girl\u2019s siblings all chained to beds throughout the house.\n\nAt first the cops thought they had found a bunch of mistreated children, but it turns out that most of the captive Turpin siblings (ranging in age from 2 to 29) were adults and were so egregiously malnourished that cops assumed that they were kids. In fact, the officers initially estimated that the 17-year-old who escaped was only 10 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could actually write most of this article with my eyes closed because, before I was assigned this story, I was up in the wee hours of the morning reading about it. Besides being fascinated by the shenanigans of weird Caucasians, my thirst for understanding has always revolved around one central question:\n\n\n\nWhy are white people like this?\n\nI don\u2019t ask that question rhetorically or with an attempt at humor. I have a serious need to know. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning investigating this story with no expectation of ever writing about it. I wanted to know for myself, but now that the editorial team at The Root has involved you in my search for answers, here\u2019s what I found at the bottom of the rabbit hole I descended into:\n\nThe Turpins have 13 children and have been married for more than 30 years; they renewed their vows in 2015, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from their affinity for bangs and Wrangler jeans, they are deeply religious and adhered to the principles of the small-but-growing Christian sect called \u201cQuiverFull.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat the hell is QuiverFull?\u201d (I have a very good internet connection.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you can make a QuiverFull souffl\u00e9 all by yourself! All you have to do is take the \u201calt-right,\u201d white supremacist belief of the white genocide movement, sprinkle in a little Christian fundamentalism and\u2014voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence.

But should they do everything? I\u2019ve compiled a short list of things that, while white guys feel totally comfortable doing, maybe they should let someone else try or just stop doing altogether.\n\nNeedlessly abbreviate words.\n\nNot too long ago, I was talking to a white colleague about referring someone for a potential job opening and my Caucasian homey said, \u201cYou should definitely consider her. She\u2019s a total natch for the role.\u201d\n\nHuh? The fuck is a \u201cnatch,\u201d bruh and should we be referring to women like that, you know, like in the workplace, like right now and shit?\n\nThen he was like, \u201cNoooo, noooo, man. I mean that she\u2019s a real natural fit for the job.\u201d Which then reminded me that white dudes always find a way to abbreviate words for no fucking reason.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while man, how was the vacay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re headed to Shake Shack to grab some burgs, dude. You wanna roll?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a little soiree at my apt this weekend. Feel free to come through with your LL (see: little lady).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis shit needs to stop. I\u2019m fluent as shit in slang, but I\u2019m fuck-all in abbreviations.\n\nSuggest places to purchase electronics.\n\nDid you know that white men go to stores where they don\u2019t know anybody that works there and pay full price for electronic items that come in sealed boxes?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrazy, right?\n\nI told one of my white compadres that I was looking for a new TV so he recommended a spot. When I asked him who I need to look for (because, you know, *wink wink*, gonna get that hook-up) he just stared at me. Then I remembered that white dudes make more money than everyone else and he could actually afford the shit I\u2019m breaking my own bank to front to get. Then I called my homie and two days later I picked up my new TV in the parking lot beside a Costco.\n\nOrder shots for the table.\n\nIt always starts the same way. You\u2019re out with your white friends having a few drinks, maybe watching the game, or doing something else alcoholically benign when the server brings over a tray of Jameson shots and then Ryan from Account Services does that dumb ass shrug while saying, \u201cUh oh, looks like it\u2019s a round of Jamo for the crew!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you thought this was just a benevolent gesture of friendship, you thought wrong. As soon as you accept that first shot, you\u2019re agreeing to take a trip down the road to white boy wasted that only ends with you sitting at your desk the next morning wearing Ray Bans indoors, guzzling a Pedialyte, and trying to ignore Ryan when he says, \u201cHey brah, I\u2019m sorry if things got a little crazy last night. I\u2019ll buy you a new phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd all you can do is shake your head as you pick glitter out of your beard.\n\n\n\nCarry guns.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that white men are more prone to violence or have some natural inclination to shoot people. What I am saying is that I\u2019m not clear on what the parameters are for getting shot by a white guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHear me out. When it comes to black people shooting black people, I have a firm understanding of how, why, and when I might get that iron pulled on me:\n\n-Selling dope in the wrong neighborhood.\n\n-Owing the wrong muthafucka some money.\n\n-Snitching.\n\n-Escalated disrespect in a public setting.\n\nAll those can and will get you shot by another black person. But with white guys, they just kinda shoot everyone, sometimes en masse, and usually no one knows why. I think we need to have a moratorium of firearms sales to white men until they can draft a clear memo detailing their shooting protocol (other than the cops just shooting black folks \u2018cause they can) so that people know what parts of town are clear and shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people always want to ask me if my neighborhood is safe to visit at night, I feel like I\u2019m owed the same courtesy.\n\nBe in charge of like, everything.\n\nIt goes without saying that, after about a 600 year or so run, white guys have had a pretty good go of the whole Eurocentric patriarchic power structure thing. And while I\u2019m sure that they\u2019d point to history as precedent as to why white men seem to be in charge of everything, have they ever asked themselves a.) why they seem to be in charge of everything and, b.) should they reasonably be in charge of everything?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and the unflattering portrait it paints of the Trump Administration, I\u2019ve seen conservative (mostly white male) commentators alleging that the stories in the book must be fabrications or exaggerations. And of course, they would. In their minds, they probably see an assembly of seemingly successful white dudes in their rightful seat of power where they (by virtue of their whiteness and maleness) shouldn\u2019t have any problems because they project success onto other white men. Ineptitude or incompetence or plain ol\u2019 stupidity aren\u2019t traits that they\u2019ve been conditioned to see in themselves (those are for the women and the coloreds) so why would they see them in their peers?\n\nThis feeds the broader point. Maybe, just maybe, being a white man isn\u2019t enough. Maybe, the Trump Administration\u2019s flaws are indicative of a larger logical fallacy that we\u2019ve fallen into and perhaps other dominions of white male supremacy are just as fucked up. Banks? Higher education? Corporate America? Perhaps they\u2019re all inhabited by a bunch of mediocre white guys who keep getting the benefit of the doubt because success has been projected upon them by their peers.\n\n\n\nJuxtapose this with Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes, where the spirit of unanimity and solidarity for inclusion and equality for women and minorities was on display beyond a mere act of sartorial activism. The Time\u2019s Up movement\u2019s presence in conjunction with Oprah Winfrey\u2019s clarion speech extolling viewers to focus on the horizon ahead stand in stark contrast with the #MAGA crowd and their insistence on perpetuating the fantasy of the patriarchal status quo. Or, simply stated, Auntie Oprah speaks for the America that, in spite of itself, could be. Diverse in its leadership, empathetic in its promise, and equitable in the distribution of its justice. Trump and his followers speak for an America that never was and will never be. But success is not zero sum; in order for others to gain, it\u2019s not as if white men have to lose.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we stand at the fulcrum between Oprah\u2019s optimism and Trump\u2019s Trumpism, we all have to ask ourselves how long we can be denied our own equitable seats at the table for the sake of giving in to an antiquated norm. The evidence shows that, try as they might, we can\u2019t just let the white guys do it all by themselves. Hell, perhaps they created systems of discrimination and oppression because they knew that all along and hoped we\u2019d never find out.\n\n\n\nToo late.", "keywords": ["wrong", "know", "stop", "im", "maybe", "letting", "white", "things", "black", "charge", "probably", "guys", "saying", "men"], "polarity": -0.0051354953897326805, "subjectivity": 0.409657868026512},

Lay Down Our Edges\n\nThis one is pretty un-fuck-with-able. Forget the wardrobe and accessories\u2014what\u2019s sis\u2019 edges looking like? If a toothbrush wasn\u2019t involved in the making of the hairstyle, go back and try again (please don\u2019t try to understand this logic; just go with it). If a proper gel or styling agent cannot be located, be sure to check with the model. Nine times out of 10, she knew y\u2019all would get it wrong and likely has all necessary styling equipment in her bag, and/or has a homegirl around the corner who can be there in 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Racism Cannot Be Cured With a Kardashian\n\nI\u2019m sure the bronzer, large number of black men, enlarged lips, cornrows and build-a-booties would lead you to believe otherwise, but trust me on this one.\n\n\n\n3. All Models of Color Must Maintain Their Melanin Throughout the Making of the Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s never a good look if a model or actor has to set aside his or her blackness for the sake of selling a product. FYI, I wasn\u2019t speaking figuratively; I said what I said. If your model must remove, lighten or disrobe their skin, you\u2019re probably going down the wrong creative path. Yes, Michael Jackson made it work for the \u201cBlack or White\u201d video, but you ain\u2019t Michael, and you dang sure ain\u2019t Tyra Banks killing \u2019em with your shoulders alongside the King of Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Don\u2019t Exclude Us\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re selling pumpkin-spice lattes with a side of cottage cheese out of the back of a Volkswagen Beetle at a Taylor Swift concert; somewhere, somehow, there\u2019s a black person who may be into it. In many ways, we\u2019re just like you, so don\u2019t leave us out. The last thing you want us to do is play a round of \u201cFind the Negro\u201d on your ad. It won\u2019t end well.\n\n5. Along Those Same Lines, Don\u2019t Assume We\u2019re Monolithic\n\nSo, you know how some white people like the color blue, while others prefer purple or yellow or orange? Well, it\u2019s exactly the same with black people. What works for some of us may not work for others (case in point: the age-old debate of grits vs. Cream of Wheat). One size does not fit all, and one marketing tactic does not work for the masses\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9, for every living being shall get into formation accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Don\u2019t Try to Be Us\n\nWhen marketing to or for a black person, it\u2019s always preferred that you use an actual black person. Aesthetically, it\u2019s a lot more pleasing.\n\n7. We Give No Cares About Your Apology\n\nThe damage is done. The racism has been distributed widely across multiple platforms and we screenshot the hell out of it, so who cares what you have to say after the fact? I\u2019m sure most brands don\u2019t intentionally sit down and say, \u201cHow can we eff with the most historically disenfranchised and oppressed group of people of all time?\u201d But unfortunately that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s impact vs. intent, and the former overshadows the latter. If you have to apologize, consider issuing an apology in the form of more diverse hires and inclusive marketing practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. When All Else Fails, Just Use the Honey Bunches of Oats Lady or Michelle Obama\n\nWe love the ish out of both of these women and would never question their judgment or discernment.

It is difficult for Americans to come to a consensus on almost anything. Some people think Kevin Hart is funny.

(She isn\u2019t a white supremacist or anything, but she did say that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts are better than Krispy Kremes, which is kind of Hitler-ish, in my opinion.)\n\nIf there is one thing on which we can all agree, I have always assumed, it\u2019s that as a society, we all think murdering children is\u2014at the very least\u2014not a good look.\n\nApparently, I was wrong.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a baby-murdering white guy walked into a church and opened fire, killing people as young as 17 months old. In 2012, Adam Lanza created his own little micro-genocide when he murdered 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn response, the Republican Party, which fancies itself the unwavering, law-and-order protectors of America, addressed these recurring existential threats to the lives and safety of millions of Americans by doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of which side of the aisle on which one sits, it is impossible for any logically thinking human being not to acknowledge that gun violence has become our national scourge. Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising.

That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank.

According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns.

In the apology, the Girls star acknowledges the \u201coften violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies, as well as false accusations by white women toward black men.\u201d\n\nIn her newsletter Lenny, Dunham had this to say about a close encounter with Beckham:\n\n\n\nI was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, \"That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.\" It wasn't mean\u2014he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, \"Do I want to [f\u2014k] it? Is it wearing a \u2026 yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone.\" It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie.

You can read Dunham\u2019s Instagram apology below:\n\n\n\nI owe Odell Beckham Jr. an apology. Despite my moments of bravado, I struggle at industry events (and in life) with the sense that I don't rep a certain standard of beauty and so when I show up to the Met Ball surrounded by models and swan-like actresses it's hard not to feel like a sack of flaming garbage. This felt especially intense with a handsome athlete as my dinner companion and a bunch of women I was sure he'd rather be seated with. But I went ahead and projected these insecurities and made totally narcissistic assumptions about what he was thinking, then presented those assumptions as facts. I feel terrible about it. Because after listening to lots of valid criticism, I see how unfair it is to ascribe misogynistic thoughts to someone I don't know AT ALL. Like, we have never met, I have no idea the kind of day he's having or what his truth is. But most importantly, I would never intentionally contribute to a long and often violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies- as well as false accusations by white women towards black men. I'm so sorry, particularly to OBJ, who has every right to be on his cell phone. The fact is I don't know about his state of mind (I don't know a lot of things) and I shouldn't have acted like I did. Much love and thanks, Lena\n\nDunham does not mention her attempts \u201cto grind [her] ass on Michael B. Jordan for an additional twenty minutes\u201d before leaving the Met Gala. She has since edited that line out of her interview with Schumer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for her completely \u201cnarcissistic assumptions\u201d about Beckham, The Root\u2019s Stephen Crockett Jr. noted, \u201cThe Girls creator took all her self-loathing and placed it on the New York Giants star receiver.\u201d Put differently, she weaponized her body against him while centering herself as the victim.\n\nThese kinds of \u201cassumptions\u201d and lies about black masculinity and predatory behavior have led to such cases as the 1944 execution of George Stinney Jr. Stinney, the youngest person executed in the United States in the 20th century, was 14 years old and weighed 95 pounds when he was accused of murdering two white girls with a railroad spike. After a long legal battle, his wrongful conviction\u2014which was handed down by an all-white male jury in 10 minutes\u2014was overturned in 2014.\n\nThese assumptions and lies also led to the 1931 false imprisonment and wrongful convictions of Alabama\u2019s Scottsboro Boys, who were accused of raping two white women; the false imprisonment and wrongful conviction of William Harper after Dorothy Skaggs accused him of rape in Virginia that same year; the 1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till by white supremacists for allegedly whistling at a white woman; and the 1989 false imprisonment and wrongful convictions of New York\u2019s Central Park Five, who were accused of raping a white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are just a few examples of the more high-profile cases.\n\nThe hypersexualization of black men in the United States goes back to the antebellum South, when slavery was built and maintained by continued sexual violence against black women. Enslaved black men were often forced to rape enslaved black women in order to produce children who, of course, would be born into slavery. White women were able to fulfill their desires and assert their power on the bodies of black men\u2014and cry victim if the need arose. These interracial \u201crelationships\u201d were somewhat accepted as long as a child was not produced. If, by chance, contraception failed and an abortion was not obtained, the resulting biracial children were either placed into slavery or became victims of infanticide.\n\nAccording to Lisa Lindquist Dorr\u2019s White Women, Rape, and the Power of Race in Virginia, 1900-1960, that tepid societal acceptance ended after the Civil War. White womanhood had always been a privileged racial class\u2014though they, too, were raped by white men. But after Reconstruction, the \u201crape myth\u201d of the black male beast that hungered for white female flesh began as a way to protect and perpetuate white supremacist capitalist patriarchy:\n\n\n\nAfter Reconstruction, whites conflated black men's desires for white women with their desire for political rights as men, thus creating the rape myth. By the twentieth century, the rape myth was at its height, and it structured most white southerners' beliefs about the consequences of allowing interaction between white women and black men. The rhetoric about black men's propensity to rape and the corresponding need for white men to protect white women flourished both in debates about black men's civil and political rights and in discussions about new freedoms and opportunities for white women. The rape myth thus enforced white women's subordination to white men and the social, economic, and political power of whites over blacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIda B. Wells-Barnett risked her life to challenge this \"rape myth\" in the 1890s by circulating anti-lynching pamphlets that called out white women's complicity in the criminalization of black men. Read her 1892 Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases here.\n\nStill, the method of using white female bodies as a means to ensure the economic and political power of white men continued and was evident in both the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, which led to the destruction of \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d and the Rosewood Massacre of 1923. Both incidents were sparked by a white woman alleging that a black man had raped her, but the mob violence was flamed because many black men in both areas were doing better financially than their white counterparts.\n\nAnd into this fraught history steps Lena Dunham, who has now realized several things:\n\nBlack male bodies are not the property of white women. There is no mandate that black penises must jump to attention in the mere presence of white female bodies. There is no decree that states that black men must stare with admiration while white women hold court. Black men are allowed to attend a fancy event and not want to \u201cf\u2014k\u201d the white women sitting next to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunham\u2019s statements do not exist in a vacuum, especially now as the resurfacing of the 1999 rape allegations against Nate Parker\u2014for which he was acquitted\u2014have brought discussions about toxic masculinity, racism and rape culture to the fore. The woman who pressed charges against Parker was, just like most of Bill Cosby\u2019s alleged victims, white.\n\nIn both cases, black feminists have worked relentlessly to unbind race and gender. They have concentrated with laser-sharp focus on society's collective need to learn and unlearn the definition of consent\u2014informed, implied, explicit, active or otherwise. Despite their best efforts, the narrative that continues to raise its ugly head is \u201cThis is just another white woman accusing a black man of rape\u201d\u2014and any black women who say differently are in league with the White Man\u2122 trying to bring a brother down.\n\nThis deeply entrenched stereotype is largely due to the racist history touched on here, but it may also stem from the reality that black women and girls are less likely to report being raped. Why? Because black women and girls who grow up being called \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cwhore,\u201d their sexuality policed and baptized away from them, have also been taught that there is a racist system that victimizes black men and boys\u2014because there is. Rarely is focus placed on the criminalization of black women and girls who also face both state and community violence, while still laboring under the expectation that it is their responsibility to protect black men and boys at all costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnequivocally, no man\u2014black, white or other\u2014is absolved of his responsibility as a human being not to rape other human beings. And it is critical to note here that despite a history of racist false accusations, only 2 to 8 percent of rape allegations are false, and 97 percent of rapists will never spend a day in jail. Despite these sobering statistics, when white women etch their own assumptions, privilege, insecurities and desires upon the bodies of black men, particularly black men who have not shown interest, discussions about rape culture become mired in racial tension and often come to a screeching halt.\n\nDunham\u2019s apology and acknowledgment of her racism in this incident is important and duly noted; however, it is equally important for her to understand that her reckless words help perpetuate a toxic culture that continues to oppress and endanger all women\u2014even white, privileged ones like herself.", "keywords": ["jr", "assumptions", "theres", "girls", "false", "bodies", "women", "woman", "violent", "white", "lying", "rape", "long", "black", "lena", "odell", "men"], "polarity": -0.02048668503213957, "subjectivity": 0.3428616932310111},

And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle go out in his truck and shoot [the gunman] and hit him and neutralize him,\u201d Trump said, referring to Stephen Willeford, the Texas man credited with shooting and chasing off the Sutherland gunman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nThis point\u2014a common conservative refrain\u2014is worth pausing on.\n\nShockingly, there is a bit of nuance that Trump inadvertently introduces. Per our current gun laws, Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sutherland Springs, should never have had a gun in the first place. Kelly\u2019s domestic violence charges were never entered into a national database, allowing him to pass background checks and buy firearms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is important to remember: We can have the right laws in place, but it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re not being enforced properly.\n\nStill, the focus on the \u201cgood guy with the gun\u201d being unable to purchase his firearm is ridiculous\u2014there is simply no way of knowing that for sure. News outlets are reporting that Willeford had a rifle and not the sort of semi-automatic weapon that would likely be subject to \u201cextreme gun vetting.\u201d (It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Willeford, as a former National Rifle Association instructor, was also a highly trained marksman, which is not true of many gun owners.)\n\nProclaiming that \u201chundreds\u201d more could have died, so we must be glad that only 26 lives were lost, is shameful and indicates how normalized mass murder has become in the U.S. As USA Today reports, 208 people have died in mass shootings this year alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reporter asked Trump whether he would consider any gun control policy.\n\n\u201cThe city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,\u201d Trump answered, brandishing a favorite and demonstrably false response that, in fact, highlights the need for federal gun regulations.\n\nAs a recent NPR fact check noted, Chicago\u2019s gun laws, while tough, are certainly not the strongest in the country. And while the state of Illinois is tough on guns, its neighboring states, Wisconsin and Indiana, aren\u2019t. Guns, like people, can easily move across state borders, and evidence shows that a significant percentage of Chicago\u2019s guns are trafficked in from states with lax gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than talk about Chicago again, the dotard in chief could very well have used South Korea as an example. The last deadly shootings in the country happened in 2015, in two back-to-back incidents. Immediately following the shootings (quite literally, on the first business day after the last incident), the South Korean government moved to track all guns in the country via GPS.\n\nRead more at NBC News.", "keywords": ["cheese", "claims", "control", "vetting", "mass", "grit", "demented", "laws", "korea", "trump", "extreme", "gun", "reporter", "guns", "latest", "shooting", "south", "difference"], "polarity": 0.05356373256373256, "subjectivity": 0.5341286676286676},

Jordan?\n\nMichael B. Jordan is perhaps the hottest Black male actor under 30 in Hollywood. In fact, he might be the only Black male actor under 30 in Hollywood. Raise your hand if you can name another Black male actor under 30 without Google. Now, take that hand and smack yourself with it, because you're a damn lie.\n\nHe also compels me to scream \"Where's Wallace???\" every time I see him on screen, but I think that's just me.\n\nWhy is he in the news this week?\n\nDuring an interview with GQ, Jordan joined Ice Cube, Tyrese, and several others on the list of famous Black guys with sizable Black female fanbases who just couldn't help themselves from opening their mouths and saying some dumb-ass shit, losing many of those fans in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaye Diggs is on that list too, right?\n\nTaye Diggs has been on that list so long that he's practically emeritus. He gets a pension from that list. That list sends him letters every six months asking him to donate to the alumni fund.\n\nSo anyway, what did Michael B. Jordan say?\n\nHe claimed to be a part of the #alllivesmatter movement, he expressed that he was \"colorblind\" with dating, and he referred to women as \"females.\" It's almost like his publicist gave him a list of things NOT to say, and he got that list confused with his talking points list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm, none of those things seem too bad, though. I mean, it's good that he has such an open world view, right?\n\nOn the surface, perhaps. Those things do sound like good things. But context matters. And as people familiar with #Blacklivesmatter will tell you, the movement isn't about valuing Black lives more than other lives. It's about how Black lives haven't been valued as much as other lives. An #alllivesmatter hashtag is ignorant and insulting because it draws attention away from the issue \u2014 Black lives, for as long as America has existed, haven't really mattered \u2014 with some redundant, post-racial gobbledegook.\n\nAlso, when an American Black male volunteers that he's a \"colorblind\" dater, 99,999 times out of 100,000 it's code for \"I'll date anyone\u2026except a Black woman. Unless, of course, she looks like Missandei.\" Perhaps Jordan is that one in 100,000, but there's a 99.999 percent chance he's not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Well, changing gears a bit, what's the big deal with female? Why are people so annoyed when that word is used instead of women? Women are females, right?\n\nWell, first it's grammatically awkward. \"Female\" is fine when you use it as an adjective. For instance, earlier I referred to Jordan's \"sizable Black female fanbase.\" Fanbase is the noun here. \"Female,\" like \"Black\" and \"sizable,\" is describing a type of fanbase.\n\nYou can also use it as a noun without it being awkward. For instance, let's say you had a job taking attendance at an amusement park. You can say \"836 females came to the park today, and 801 males.\" This is an instance where the use of \"female\" and \"male\" would be appropriate. (You should also go back to school, because a job taking attendance at an amusement park sounds like the worst job ever.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's inappropriate when it's used as a substitute for \"women.\" For instance, \"Don't you hate it when females text all the time?\" is grammatically awkward because you're clearly referring to grown female human beings. And there's already a word for grown female humans beings! Women! If you're referring to a female human being who is not grown yet, the word is \"girl.\" And, if you want to be more creative and/or colloquial in your reference to female human beings, \"ladies\" could work. Shit, \"chick\" even has less of a negative connotation than \"female.\" (\"Earth\" works here too, if you're in the Wu-Tang Clan.)\n\nOk, so it's grammatically awkward. I still don't see the issue here.\n\nThis is why context matters. Because experience has taught many of us that the type of person (men and women) to regularly refer to men as \"men\" and women as \"females\" is often the type of person who also has some pretty backward (and, often, dangerous) beliefs about women. The word \"female\" strips a woman of her humanity, reducing her to her sexual parts, and people who use female tend to view women through that lens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's basically a polite way of saying \"bitches.\" And not in an ironic sense, but a \"bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks\" sense.\n\nSo, what's next for Michael B. Jordan?\n\nHe's still very young, so he still has time to become wiser, more worldly, and more media savvy. Or, he could just start dating Janelle Monae, and get all of his Black points back in one fell swoop.", "keywords": ["explained", "youre", "women", "list", "stop", "females", "female", "male", "lives", "referring", "things", "black", "probably", "word"], "polarity": -0.00878520225294419, "subjectivity": 0.44542902438063736},

What is to blame for this? Regarding the recent Texas church massacre, President Donald Trump stated that this was caused by a \u201cmental health problem.\u201d\n\nIn other words, guns don\u2019t kill people ... yeah, let me stop you there and dispel that myth. In 2015, suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States. A total of 22,018 people used a firearm to commit suicide. Adding to that number, with the 12,979 homicides that were carried out using a firearm, there were 34,997 total deaths caused by firearm in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only November, but 2017 has been considered the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history. This despite the fact that the 1921 Tulsa, Okla., race riot; the 1923 Rosewood, Fla., massacre; and the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee, just to name a few, all had greater tragic losses of life in a single instance in this country.\n\n\n\nFor the record, the current federal definition of a mass killing (pdf) is \u201cthree or more killings in a single incident and must occur in a place of public use.\u201d So far, there have been 112 people killed and 531 people wounded in mass shootings this year. To put it bluntly, guns definitely kill people ... a lot of people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s answer to these violent events is a very convenient and plausible excuse for the population as it pertains to mental health because of two things: 1) the population doesn\u2019t know a lot about mental illness to begin with, and 2) they don\u2019t want to know about mental illness. So this seems like it would make sense.\n\nBut people who have more than just a cursory knowledge of mental illness will tell you that this likely isn\u2019t mental illness.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s line of thinking has been a popular excuse for people committing violent crimes and crimes in general. But mental illness is responsible only for 3 to 5 percent of violent crimes. This means that the people who are committing violent crimes are far more likely\u201419 times more likely\u2014not to have a mental illness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good rule of thumb for most things is to understand one main concept: There is a difference between mental illness and bad behavior.\n\n\n\nJust because someone does something that is unusual or not normal to you does not mean, by default, that someone is mentally ill. I get it\u2014these events cause shock, disgust and make you feel sick. However, if there is no evaluation, you should probably err on the side of bad behavior. If the shooter was killed, there is little else to go off of other than family members, who might suffer from recall or responder bias, which makes any evaluation ultimately unreliable.\n\nA person who has not previously been diagnosed with a mental illness and who commits a violent crime is likely not suffering from mental illness and is probably just evil. Yes, I know, there is no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 designation for being evil. Which is why being a bad person isn\u2019t a mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is more likely that these are horrible people with poor coping skills ... and access to firearms. Don\u2019t believe me? OK, consider this: If someone shot and killed your relative, what are you thinking of first? That the shooter had a mental illness or that the shooter was simply a horrible person? Exactly.\n\n\n\nNeed another example? OK. What if your roommate was secretly poisoning you and posting on Instagram step-by-step everything she or he did to you? Would you think that your roommate had a mental illness or that your roommate was a horrible person? Too easy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you noticed that with respect to people who commit a violent crime, the benefit of the doubt about whether they\u2019re suffering from mental illness is inversely proportional to the amount of melanin in their body?\n\n\n\nIf you have a lot of melanin, you are considered a thug, a terrorist and un-American. However, if you have very little melanin, you are mentally ill and are worthy of people suggesting that you had an undiagnosed, and unknown, mental illness, personality disorder or any number of other maladies, and you deserve some compassion.\n\nAfter all, why else would someone with privilege commit a crime? Affluenza, anyone?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I am not caping for terrorism, foreign or domestic.\n\nHowever, the selective framing and cognitive dissonance that seems to dominate the narrative of these types of incidents makes the optics of perceptions of mental illness and mental health look bad, and it is the wrong way to address these events.\n\n\n\nThe ramification of using mental illness as a scapegoat increases the stigma that is attached to mental illness. This stigma makes people far less likely to seek out professional help to improve their mental health. Not to mention it also increases the criminalization of mental illness, when, in fact, people who have mental illness are 10 times more likely to be the victims of violent crime, not the perpetrators of crime.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t expect Congress to do anything about it. It did nothing when the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shootings occurred in Newtown, Conn. Hell, members of Congress were actually shot at and kept right on going like nothing happened. If they don\u2019t care about their own lives, I am certain they don\u2019t care about yours. But, hey, thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n\nNeither thoughts nor prayers are going to be able to stop a bullet or people\u2019s suffering.\n\nBy the way, those survivors and family members of the victims? They are dealing with mental health challenges as they struggle to understand why their loved ones were tragically taken away and why the government repeatedly fails to prevent these senseless losses of life caused by people behaving badly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, if this is a mental health problem, perhaps Trump is to blame, because he did sign into law a bill that rolled back an Obama-administration measure that had made it harder for people with mental illness to procure firearms.\n\n\n\nBut when you have shock, disgust and emotion, who needs facts?\n\n\n\nTerrance McGill, M.D., MPH, specializes in preventive medicine, mental health and addiction medicine.
