Gardner, the Democratic prosecutor in St. Louis who brought the case before a grand jury. A contingent of allies of Mr. Greitens in the State Republican Party remained supportive on Friday, or stayed silent on the matter.\n\n\u201cMissourians should see this for what it is, a political hit job,\u201d said Sam Cooper, the executive director of the State Republican Party. \u201cWe have a progressive anti-law enforcement Democrat wanting to single-handedly oust a law-and-order governor.\u201d\n\nMr. Greitens, a first-time politician, had clashed with Republican lawmakers since taking office in January 2017. Mr. Greitens, a married father of two thought to have ambitions for higher office, admitted last month that he had an extramarital affair in 2015, before he was elected. But the governor has repeatedly denied reports that he took a compromising photo of the woman without permission and blackmailed her.\n\nThe felony indictment handed up Thursday by a St. Louis grand jury accused Mr. Greitens, 43, of photographing a nude or partially nude person in 2015 without consent, a charge that carries up to four years in prison if he is convicted. The governor\u2019s lawyers said that he violated no laws and that they were seeking to have the case dismissed.\n\nBut Missouri lawmakers could begin deciding whether to impeach Mr. Greitens even before he appears in court, on March 16, in the criminal case. Lawmakers are expected to file resolutions asking for an investigation of the invasion of privacy allegations as early as Monday, when they return to Jefferson City, the capital. Such resolutions are required to start an impeachment process under Missouri law.\n\nPhoto\n\nState Senator Caleb Rowden, a Republican, wrote that he would urge his colleagues \u201cto take all necessary actions to remove the governor from office\u201d if Mr. Greitens refuses to resign. Josh Hawley, the state attorney general who is seeking the Republican nomination for Ms. McCaskill\u2019s seat, called the indictment \u201ca serious matter\u201d and said \u201cthe criminal justice system must be allowed to work.\u201d And Kathie Conway, a state representative, said she would prefer that the governor step aside rather than risk impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to do nothing but be hurtful to him, to his wife, to those close to him,\u201d said Ms. Conway, a Republican from suburban St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s just a battle that I just don\u2019t want to be in the middle of.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTodd Richardson, the Republican speaker of the House, indicated that if Mr. Greitens remained in office, he would support an investigation of the governor \u2014 a move that could lead to impeachment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If a majority of House members voted to impeach, the State Senate would select a special commission of judges to try the case.\n\nLt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican who previously served as a sheriff and a state legislator, would become governor if Mr. Greitens left office.\n\nNational Republicans gave little indication that they were taking a stand on Mr. Greitens\u2019s case. But if lawmakers in Jefferson City move forward with impeachment, Republicans could be faced with months of headlines about a sex scandal in a year when they hope to maintain their large majorities in the Missouri General Assembly and to unseat Ms. McCaskill.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a real concern,\u201d said Ms. Conway, the legislator. \u201cThis is a fact: We have a Republican governor who\u2019s been indicted. We have a Senate seat that\u2019s up that\u2019s a very important seat to the party nationally.\u201d\n\nState Representative Galen Higdon, a Republican, said he did not yet know whether the governor\u2019s claims of a politically biased prosecution had merit. Mr. Higdon said he supported a legislative investigation of the governor\u2019s conduct, but was not yet calling on him to resign.\n\nYou \u201cdon\u2019t want a knee-jerk reaction to something like this,\u201d Mr. Higdon said. \u201cYou want to do your due diligence and take your time and figure out what\u2019s the best option.\u201d\n\nOthers came to the defense of Ms. Gardner and noted that grand jurors, not the prosecutor herself, made the decision to indict the governor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a witch hunt by any means,\u201d said Mr. Walker, the Republican lawmaker. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a governor who is corrupt or has done things that are illegal. And if you get a felony indictment against you, that\u2019s pretty serious.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "resign", "missouri", "office", "governor", "ms", "thats", "resists", "republican", "state", "pressure", "greitens", "indicted", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.07252763194252558, "subjectivity": 0.44072027263516633},

And in an interview before he took the stage, Mr. Cruz ran through the policies that pleased him the most.\n\nRegulatory reform, Mr. Cruz said, was \u201can unalloyed success\u201d for the president.

Those skeptics worry that if Mr. Trump keeps getting cast by Republicans as a champion of conservatism \u2014 when they believe he is just an opportunist with no real ideological core \u2014 the movement is doomed.\n\n\u201cIn three years (maybe seven), Donald Trump will no longer be president,\u201d Richard Brookhiser, a conservative scholar, wrote in National Review a few days before the conference began. \u201cBut conservatives who bent the knee will still be writing and thinking. How will it be possible to take them seriously?

He paused when he got to deregulation, which he called \u201cspectacular.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why stuff like Stormy Daniels isn\u2019t mattering,\u201d Mr. Cuccinelli added, referring to the actress who once claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Teflon armor Mr. Trump has built up with many conservatives, especially religious and social conservatives, has become one of the most predictable aspects of his presidency.\n\nWhen reports surfaced that Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer had paid $130,000 to Ms. Daniels after she came forward with an account of having an affair with Mr. Trump before he ran for office, leaders of the religious right were largely unmoved. Hardly anyone made the kind of apocalyptic predictions that were constantly voiced during the 2016 campaign when he would do something outrageous.\n\nNot that conservatives are exactly overjoyed. The mood at the gathering this year was a testament to that. For much of the two-day event, the crowds seemed thinner and the atmosphere decidedly flatter than last year, when activists were still on a high from the Republicans\u2019 unexpected victory and greeted now-departed members of the administration like Stephen K. Bannon and Reince Priebus with a rapturous welcome.\n\nWhen administration officials like Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, spoke this week, they did so to a hall with row after row of empty seats.\n\nEnthusiasm may have been missing from much of the festivities this year. But Mr. Trump\u2019s influence was still apparent. Speakers borrowed signature phrases of his like \u201cfake news.\u201d Some, like Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, indulged the president\u2019s complaints that the Justice Department was engaged in a political witch hunt against him.\n\nNigel Farage, the British politician credited with helping push his country toward exiting the European Union, was a featured speaker. The editor of Breitbart in London introduced him. Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, a rising star of the nationalistic hard right in France, also spoke.\n\nEven the panel discussions had a Trumpian edge, with titles like \u201c#TrumpedUp: Unmasking the Deep State\u201d and \u201cThe Political Weaponization of Prosecutions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cRomney used to own this place,\u201d said David Bozell, a conservative activist, referring to the 2012 Republican nominee. \u201cNow Romney is running for Senate in Utah and he doesn\u2019t even show up.

That\u2019s a problem given that, in the last four downturns, the Fed has cut rates by an average of 5.5 percentage points to stimulate renewed growth.\n\nDuring the last downturn, the Fed reduced the benchmark rate to nearly zero in 2008, and then supplemented its efforts by pledging to keep interest rates at a low level and by purchasing large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds.\n\nFed officials have said that those policies benefited the economy, and could be used again during a future downturn. Other central banks have relied on similar policies in recent years, and have reached similar conclusions. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a board member of the European Central Bank, said economic research was \u201cfairly clear\u201d that such asset purchases helped to hold down interest rates.\n\nBut the main paper presented at the conference on Friday, which is hosted by the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, asserted that bond-buying had little economic benefit.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is that the most important and reliable instrument of monetary policy is the short term interest rate,\u201d wrote the authors, a team of two academics and two bank economists.\n\nThe danger of a rapid return to near-zero interest rates seemed particularly acute in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as the Fed repeatedly delayed any increase in rates. Now, the economy has gained strength and the Fed has raised rates five times. Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said the progress showed the Fed\u2019s policies had helped, and that the Fed might be able to raise interest rates above current expectations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Interest rates include expected inflation, so higher inflation would raise rates.\n\nEmbracing higher inflation, however, could cause political problems for the Fed.\n\nAlternatively, the Fed could tolerate higher inflation on a temporary basis. For example, the Fed could aim to maintain average inflation at 2 percent over some specified period, meaning that it would compensate for periods of lower inflation, as during the last six years, by allowing periods of higher inflation, thus maintaining a 2 percent average.\n\nLast year, the Fed began to include a comparison between its actual management of interest rates, and the results produced by alternative approaches to monetary policy.\n\nThe report on Friday included an inflation averaging approach among those alternatives for the first time.", "keywords": ["economy", "officials", "reserve", "downturn", "higher", "feds", "view", "policies", "grows", "rate", "federal", "fed", "frets", "rates", "inflation", "interest"], "polarity": 0.12539276060402818, "subjectivity": 0.3519584679795948},

He complained that it had taken \u201cmonths and months and months\u201d for some of his staff members to be given their security clearances, despite the fact that some of them do not have complicated financial backgrounds \u2014 a factor that sometimes delays background investigations.\n\nWhile the federal security clearance system has long been criticized as broken and has a backlog of hundreds of thousands of pending applications, senior White House officials almost always have their applications expedited so they can be cleared within weeks and perform their duties.\n\nIt is highly unusual for multiple senior officials to spend months serving with only interim clearances, a problem that Mr. Kelly privately began talking about fixing in September.\n\nMr. Kushner met with Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigators briefly last year to discuss his dealings with the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.

When it comes to video games, he said, \u201cthe overwhelming majority of kids who play do not commit antisocial acts.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of American adults \u2014 including roughly equal numbers of men and women \u2014 play video games, whether on a computer, a TV, a gaming console, or a portable device like a cellphone or an iPad.\n\nIn Japan, about 60 percent of the population played video games in 2016, according to NewZoo, a gaming market research company. But almost no one is killed by a gun in the country, which bans possessing, carrying, selling, or buying handguns or rifles. There were only six gun deaths in Japan in 2014, compared with over 33,000 in the United States, according to GunPolicy.org, which tracks published reports on armed violence, firearm law and gun control.\n\nIn 2013, The New York Times looked at research on whether games negatively affect long-term behavior, and more recent science does not contradict these findings.\n\nA burst of new research has begun to clarify what can and cannot be said about the effects of violent gaming. Playing the games can and does stir hostile urges and mildly aggressive behavior in the short term. Moreover, youngsters who develop a gaming habit can become slightly more aggressive \u2014 as measured by clashes with peers, for instance \u2014 at least over a period of a year or two. Yet it is not at all clear whether, over longer periods, such a habit increases the likelihood that a person will commit a violent crime, like murder, rape or assault, much less a Newtown-like massacre. (Such calculated rampages are too rare to study in any rigorous way, researchers agree.)\n\nThe argument that violent video games are to blame for real-world violence has been rejected by conservative titans including Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2011, the Supreme Court rejected the claim that violent video games promote real-life violence when it ruled 7 to 2 in Brown v.

And while Mr. Trump has made progress in his deregulatory agenda, his claims of achieving more success in one year than throughout the entire presidencies of any of his predecessors is hyperbole, not fact.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Newly Invented (And Inflated) 22-1 Ratio\n\nMr. Trump demanded the so-called \u201c2-for-1 rule\u201d in one of his first executive orders. He claims that it has been so successful that the federal government has actually eliminated 22 regulations for every one enacted.\n\nA White House fact sheet from December declared that the Trump administration had \u201cissued 67 deregulatory actions while imposing only three new regulatory actions.\u201d To back up its claim, the fact sheet cited a chart published by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs that described each of the actions.\n\nBut the chart \u2014 which the federal Regulatory Information Service Center says has never been compiled during earlier presidencies \u2014 raises more questions than it answers. For example:\n\n\u25a0 A database that is maintained by the White House regulatory affairs office outlines 34 \u201cderegulatory\u201d actions, compared to 67 in the chart. The White House did not respond to repeated inquiries to explain the discrepancy. \u25a0 Some items labeled \u201cderegulatory action\u201d clearly involve some regulation as well. For instance, one \u201cderegulatory action\u201d lifts a ban on imports of pitahaya, or dragon fruit, from Ecuador. But it also subjects the imports to new inspections requirements. Other actions are temporary, like the dismissal of a century-old shipping law to help hurricane aid efforts in Puerto Rico. Doing so was labeled a \u201cderegulatory action,\u201d although it only lasted 10 days and Mr. Trump declined to fully or permanently renew it. \u25a0 Not all actions are created equal. Three actions designated as \u201cregulatory\u201d were described as economically significant \u2014 meaning that they have an impact of $100 million or more. Only two \u201cderegulatory\u201d actions were considered economically significant. \u25a0 Of the 65 other \u201cderegulatory actions\u201d on the chart, 60 percent were either routine, administrative or otherwise not significant. About one-third of those efforts to roll back regulations began under President Barack Obama. And 10 do not appear to be rules \u2014 they are advisory notices or guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\u201cThe 22-1 ratio needs to be taken with a grain of salt,\u201d said Susan Dudley, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President George W. Bush.\n\nTrying to Claim the Deregulation Crown, Inaccurately\n\nIn October, Mr. Trump boasted that under his administration, \u201cwe have stopped or eliminated more regulations in the last eight months than any president has done during an entire term. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump later compared the deregulatory actions in his first year in office to all of those taken during the full \u201cfour years, eight years, or, in one instance, 16 years\u201d in all previous presidential administrations.\n\nNo American president has served for 16 years; Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four presidential terms but only served for 12 years before dying in office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBeyond that, comparing regulatory activity across administrations is an imperfect exercise. Standards for making and revoking rules are frequently changing, and courts and Congress can tweak and review them as well. But available metrics indicate that Mr. Trump is wrong to claim he has already stopped or eliminated more federal rules than any other president.\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs says it withdrew 635 rules in 2017 \u2014 a fast pace over a one-year period by any measure. But that is not more than any previous presidency \u2014 Mr. Obama withdrew 1,814 federal rules during his eight-year term and Mr. Bush eliminated 2,813 while in office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Program for Economic Research on Regulation, at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., combs the Federal Register to quantify the number of rule-making actions by regulatory agencies. University researchers found that federal regulations actually grew by about 0.65 percent during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office. They also noted that the rate of growth was slower than what it was annually from 1970 to 2016, when it averaged about 2.1 percent.\n\nExperts said that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to cut through the bureaucracy fall far short of the structural changes made under Ronald Reagan, who abolished entire regulatory agencies and eliminated some economic regulations in the transportation, telecommunications and energy industries. \u201cNothing Trump has done to date compares to that in terms of impact on Americans,\u201d Ms. Dudley said.\n\nCary Coglianese, the director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that \u201ca lot of the key institutions\u2019 processes that we have today, dealing with regulation, were established by Reagan.\u201d He pointed to the 1981 enactment of cost-benefit analyses and legal challenges to Mr. Reagan\u2019s deregulation policies that set current standards for administrative law, which govern how federal, state and local agencies operate.\n\nDeregulatory Successes and a Word of Caution\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s hyperbole not withstanding, he can claim some deregulatory successes.\n\nPrevious reports in The New York Times have detailed the Trump administration\u2019s lax enforcement of certain rules across several agencies. Early in his administration, Mr. Trump rolled back Obama-era rules though an unprecedented use of the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to \u201cdisapprove\u201d regulations issued within 90 days with the help of the president.\n\nDan Goldbeck of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit conservative group that promotes smaller government, said he sees a more concerted effort to streamline and trim back regulations under Mr. Trump than under many previous administrations.\n\nThe pace of consideration for significant regulations also has slowed. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reviewed 60 rules that were described as economically significant between Jan. 21, 2017, to Jan. 20, 2018. The last time so few federal rules were reviewed in one-year was 1984, under Mr. Reagan.\n\nRegulations, Going Forward\n\nThe federal regulatory system will continue to evolve throughout \u2014 and beyond \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s time in office. So will his own approach, experts said.\n\nSo far in the 2018 fiscal year, the administration has shifted its deregulation efforts toward making substantive changes through the regular rule-making process, Mr. Goldbeck said. As evidence, he pointed to a new rule to amend the federal meat inspection process that the Department of Agriculture estimates could save millions of dollars annually, according to a department estimate. \u201cBut expect to see a delay\u201d in how much fruit these efforts will bear Mr. Goldbeck said. \u201cThat\u2019s just nature of the process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has reversed at least one of his own decisions, backtracking on his waiver to regulate state government drug-testing rules.\n\nAdditionally, there is no guarantee that regulations that have been waived will survive legal challenges, nor that they will remain in place in future presidential administrations. Once agencies complete the rule-making process, Ms. Dudley said, \u201cthey will likely have to defend their deregulatory action in court, where they may or may not succeed.\u201d Congress also could later decide to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cRegulatory change is not forever.

So to speak.\n\nAppearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., the president poked fun at his own mop, a tangle of twists and turns that coalesce in what, in the end, becomes an apparent full head of hair.\n\nBut if you look within, the president said, not all is as it seems. As Mr. Trump was speaking, a television monitor, showing him on the stage, caught his eye.\n\n\u201cWhat a nice picture that is,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at that.

Klein, who runs the Zionist Organization of America, a nonprofit group that is funded partly by Mr. Adelson. \u201cIt should be crystal-clear that this is the U.S. government making the decision to move it.\u201d\n\nThrough a representative, Mr. Adelson declined to comment on Friday. His offer of a donation was first reported by The Associated Press.\n\nSteve Goldstein, the under secretary for public diplomacy, said State Department lawyers began looking several weeks ago at whether it was legal to accept a private donation to build an embassy, a process that continues. He said the department was not currently negotiating with any private citizen for a donation, and that a new embassy building would take seven to 10 years to construct.\n\nIt was not clear whether private donors had ever helped with the financial costs to build an American embassy. Patrick Kennedy, who last year retired from the State Department, where he served as under secretary for management, said donors in the past had contributed millions of dollars to refurbish the palatial United States ambassadors\u2019 residences in London, Paris, Rome and Tokyo.\n\n\u201cAs long as a donor passes an ethics and background check, we\u2019ll take their money if they\u2019re willing to give it.

With an estimated net worth of $40 billion, Mr. Adelson donated heavily to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and gave $5 million to the committee organizing the president\u2019s inauguration festivities, the largest such contribution ever.\n\nMr. Trump vowed during his campaign that, if elected, he would \u201cfairly quickly\u201d move the embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

But a member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition welcomed the plan on the temporary embassy.\n\n\u201cI would like to congratulate Donald Trump, the President of the US @POTUS on his decision to transfer the US Embassy to our capital on Israel\u2019s 70th Independence Day,\u201d Israel Katz, the minister of transportation and intelligence, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThere is no greater gift than that!

For the Palestinians, Israel\u2019s 70th anniversary also marks 70 years of the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes and became refugees during the hostilities leading up to, and the war surrounding, Israel\u2019s creation in 1948.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the U.S. administration to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to choose the anniversary of the Nakba of the Palestinian people for carrying out this step expresses a flagrant violation of the law,\u201d Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and a veteran Palestinian negotiator, said in a statement on Friday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But, he added, \u201cthis will increase the negative feelings toward the United States and the notion that it is too biased toward Israel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring a trip to Israel last month, Vice President Mike Pence predicted that the new embassy in Jerusalem would open by the end of 2019.\n\nBut Mr. Goldstein said the move was now scheduled to happen in mid-May, when Ambassador David M. Friedman will relocate to an American consular office in Jerusalem\u2019s Arnona neighborhood that will temporarily serve as the United States\u2019 main diplomatic post in Israel.\n\nMr. Adelson is a longtime patron of Mr. Netanyahu. He has financed the newspaper Israel Hayom in an apparent attempt to help Mr. Netanyahu come to power and remain there.\n\nIsrael Hayom began publishing in 2007, when Mr. Netanyahu was still the leader of the opposition, and has deeply cut into the advertising base and readership of its main competitor, Yedioth Ahronoth, which has often been sharply critical of Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nMr. Adelson\u2019s offer to help fund a new embassy may have more to do with his staunchly pro-Israel stance and his relationship with Mr. Trump than his ties with Mr. Netanyahu. Those relations may have cooled as a result of the Israeli police\u2019s corruption investigations into Mr. Netanyahu, one of which directly involves his actions in the newspaper rivalry.\n\nMr. Netanyahu was recorded in meetings negotiating mutual benefits with an old foe, Arnon Mozes, who is the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth. The prime minister is accused of offering to help Yedioth Ahronoth financially in return for more positive coverage \u2014 including by curtailing the circulation of Israel Hayom, and limiting its weekend supplement.\n\nMr. Adelson has been questioned at least once by the Israeli authorities in connection with the case. The police have recommended charging Mr. Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\nWhile Israelis warmly welcomed the Trump administration\u2019s recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, analysts said the embassy move in May was unlikely to improve Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fortunes in the long term. In interviews, many Israelis said they had not even realized that the Americans did not consider Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Klein, of the Zionist Organization of America, described Mr. Adelson as \u201cvery excited\u201d when he was first told by Mr. Trump that the embassy would be moved to Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cIt is a critically important issue to Sheldon Adelson,\u201d Mr. Klein said in an interview on Friday.\n\nThe Arnona building where the temporary American Embassy will be housed, and the land adjacent to it, roughly straddles the seam between West Jerusalem, where Israelis live, and East Jerusalem, which is a largely Arab community. That would make it ideal for serving both Israeli and Palestinian populations, Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nThe United States has an option to purchase land adjacent to the Arnona building, a parcel that is big enough to handle an embassy, Mr. Kennedy said. Leases now in effect are likely to delay the transfer of the property until at least 2020, he said.\n\nEmbassies can cost anywhere from $150 million to nearly $1 billion to build. The one in Jerusalem is likely to cost somewhere in the middle of that range \u2014 about $500 million \u2014 because it does not need the housing, warehouse or security functions of some of the most expensive buildings, such as those in Baghdad and Kabul, Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nSome staff members at the American Embassy could remain in Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s business center.", "keywords": ["mr", "netanyahu", "jerusalem", "embassy", "pay", "supporter", "capital", "trump", "offers", "hardline", "adelson", "israels", "palestinian", "israel"], "polarity": 0.1077717019822283, "subjectivity": 0.40041695146958295},

Licensing rules were tightened, a 28-day waiting period for gun purchases was imposed and a national gun registry was established.\n\nVideo\n\nSemiautomatic rifles, like the one used at Port Arthur in 1996 and in Parkland last week, were severely restricted, and Australia engaged in a buyback program that took more than 650,000 firearms off the streets and generated attention around the world.\n\nGun control advocates in the United States regularly point to Australia when the other side says that new laws would not make a difference. President Barack Obama cited Australia as a model after a shooting in Oregon in 2015 and Hillary Clinton, running to succeed him against Mr. Trump, said the Australian approach was \u201cworth considering.\u201d\n\nThat was a theme picked up by Sam Zeif, 18, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, who was among the survivors of last week\u2019s shooting to visit the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, there was a shooting at a school in 1999,\u201d he told Mr. Trump, getting the date slightly off and mistaking the setting, which was actually a tourist site not a school. \u201cAnd you know, after that, they took a lot of ideas, they put legislation together and they stopped it. Can anyone here guess how many shootings there have been in the schools since then in Australia? Zero. We need to do something.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association has long pushed back against the Australia model, citing studies that it says do not prove that the restrictions have been effective. While it is true that Australia has not seen a mass shooting comparable to Port Arthur or Parkland since 1996, the N.R.A. argues that such episodes are rare enough that it would be statistically incorrect for gun control supporters to draw a cause-and-effect conclusion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWith such little evidence supporting their doctrines, these fanatics should spare Americans the proselytizing,\u201d Chris W. Cox, a top N.R.A. lobbyist, wrote in November. \u201cEven more to the point, the ongoing destruction of personal freedom in Australia stands as a stark and constant reminder of just how far gun control extremists are willing to go in their quest to disarm law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nPolls show more than 90 percent support in Australia for the two-decades-old gun regime, but it has also been gradually loosening its laws in recent years and gun sales are increasing. Those who own guns own more guns \u2014 in some cases, 100 or more. Semiautomatic handgun sales, which are not as regulated as rifles, have skyrocketed.\n\nData from GunPolicy.org, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for firearm policy data, shows that from 1988 to 2015, Australians surrendered roughly 1.1 million guns in various buybacks \u2014 and bought roughly 1 million new ones.\n\nPhoto\n\nExperts have debated the impact of Australia\u2019s program for years. Studies have showed that the combined policies enacted after the 1996 tragedy reduced mass shootings and suicides, with the largest declines in states that turned over the most weapons. There has been only one case of at least four people shot to death in Australia since 1996, a father who killed his wife and three children before killing himself in 2014.\n\nWhat the United States can learn from Australia, some experts said, is that guns should be viewed not just as the cause of mass killings, but also as a public health issue that leads to death in other ways.\n\n\u201cThe gun is to gun violence as the mosquito is to malaria,\u201d said Philip Alpers, a University of Sydney professor and founding director of GunPolicy.org. \u201cIt\u2019s the agent of harm and it needs to be treated in the same way it would be treat in any other public health campaign.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Then and now, the politics and the countries are more different than alike.\n\nMr. Howard had just won a landslide victory when he pushed gun control through parliament and, experts noted, Australia is a much smaller country with a population that tends to put more faith in government regulation.\n\n\u201cIf the question is: \u2018Would what Australia did work in the United States?\u2019 the answer is no,\u201d Mr. Alpers said. \u201cWhat Australia did was a confiscation of private property under the threat of jail time, compensated or not.

Ms. Trump, using time-tested diplomatic language, told reporters she would \u201creaffirm our commitment to our maximum-pressure campaign to ensure that the Korean Peninsula is denuclearized.\u201d\n\nUnder Mr. Moon\u2019s liberal government, South Korea has responded positively to North Korea\u2019s proposal of dialogue. That has caused strains with the Trump administration, which fears that premature diplomatic contacts could undermine the pressure campaign.\n\nMr. Moon left no doubt about his appetite for engagement on Friday. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s participation in the Winter Olympic Games,\u201d he said, \u201chas served as an opportunity for us to engage in active discussions between the two Koreas and this has led to lowering of tensions on the peninsula.\u201d\n\nAt Mr. Moon\u2019s prodding, the White House now says it would be open to holding preliminary talks with North Korea, too, a shift from its earlier refusal to do so until Pyongyang stopped its provocative nuclear and missile tests. But the administration\u2019s messages on North Korea remain contradictory, veering from openness to threats of force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy sending his telegenic daughter, Mr. Trump is projecting soft power and possibly countering Mr. Kim\u2019s well-received decision two weeks ago to send his 30-year-old sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony. Mr. Trump also authorized a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and North Korean officials when he sent Mr. Pence as his emissary to the Games\u2019 opening ceremony. The North Koreans, put off by the vice president\u2019s harsh criticism, canceled at the last minute.\n\nBut the sanctions underscore Mr. Trump\u2019s readiness to use hard power. The administration described the ones announced this week as the strongest package yet \u2014 a distinction that has been true of multiple previous rounds.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThe administration is trying to do both of these things simultaneously, and the issue is whether it will work,\u201d said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, who was involved in diplomacy during the Clinton administration that led to a nuclear agreement in 1994.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a North Korean,\u201d he added, \u201cyou might conclude that their efforts at diplomacy aren\u2019t sincere, that they\u2019re faking it.\u201d\n\nMr. Wit said, however, that he expected the administration to continue to explore ways to engage North Korea. Part of the problem, officials said, is that in the administration, there remains a division between those in the State Department who favor diplomacy and those in the National Security Council who favor a harder line.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the Treasury Department was not prepared to release them at the time, a senior official said, and it has been scrambling to catch up ever since.\n\nIn the past, the United States has gone after ships suspected of transporting missiles and nuclear proliferation material. But stopping vessels suspected of carrying commercial goods, experts said, would be a major step up in the pressure campaign against Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cThat goes into the realm of an economic blockade,\u201d said Abraham M. Denmark, a former Pentagon official who is now the director of the Asia program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cIt would be moving beyond proliferation and going after things that sustain North Korea\u2019s economic lifeline.\u201d\n\nSuch a move, he predicted, will meet resistance from China and Russia. Those countries thwarted an effort in December by the administration to put a provision into the latest United Nations Security Council resolution on North Korea that would permit countries to hail and board North Korean ships in international waters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to China, the Treasury Department sanctioned ships from North Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Marshall Islands, Tanzania, Panama, and Comoros. It did not blacklist ships or companies from Russia, even though that country is suspected of supporting the illicit trade.\n\nA senior administration official said the United States had raised concerns about smuggling with Russia and had previously designated Russian entities with links to North Korea.\n\n\u201cWhether they\u2019re Russian ships, whether they\u2019re Chinese ships \u2014 we don\u2019t care whose ships they are,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIf we have intelligence that people are doing things, we will put sanctions on them.\u201d\n\nHe said the 28 ships blacklisted \u2014 with names like Oriental Treasure, Asia Bridge 1 and Koti \u2014 constituted virtually all the vessels currently known to engage in prohibited trade with North Korea.\n\nAs Mr. Mnuchin spoke in the White House briefing room, large boards behind him showed satellite images of a ship-to-ship transfer in December involving a North Korean and a Panamanian vessel. The identity of the North Korean ship had been masked with a Chinese name and home port.\n\nThe American military has begun contingency planning to stop and board suspect vessels bound for North Korea. But it is a perilous undertaking.\n\nNavy or Marine warships would deploy small boats carrying troops who are trained in what the Pentagon calls visit, board, search and seizure operations. Once aboard, military officials said, the search party would have two options: sweep the ship and turn it back over to its crew or, if ordered by their commanders, seize it.\n\nThe military, however, has options short of boarding, officials said. It could track suspect vessels, by sea or with P-3 or P-8 surveillance planes, until they make port. The United States or its allies could then call on that nation to inspect the ship\u2019s cargo to determine whether it violated existing United Nations sanctions.\n\nEvan S.

It banned interstate mail orders of all firearms, interstate handgun sales and weapons with no \u201csporting purpose.\u201d It prohibited the sale of firearms to minors, felons, fugitives, drug addicts and those committed to a mental institution. And it required gun manufacturers and dealers to be licensed and maintain records of sales.\n\n\u25a0 After an intense lobbying effort by gun advocates, the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act of 1986 lifted some of those restrictions. The 1986 law allowed dealers to sell rifles and shotguns through the mail, and it limited federal inspections of gun dealers.

However, private transactions were exempted, creating the so-called gun-show loophole.\n\n\u25a0 The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned the possession, transfer or domestic manufacturing of some semiautomatic assault weapons for 10 years. Known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, it expired in 2004, despite efforts by gun control advocates to extend it.\n\n\u25a0 In 2008, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act after a shooting at Virginia Tech a year earlier had killed 33.

Two other states regulate military-grade firearms. State gun laws are tracked, in detail, by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for gun control.\n\nAccording to the law center, states with the strictest gun control measures have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths. Those states include California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Conversely, states that do not aggressively regulate guns \u2014 like Alabama, Alaska and Louisiana \u2014 have the highest.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

In one prominent case, the Supreme Court limited gun control efforts in its 2009 ruling District of Columbia v. Heller.\n\nSince then, however, the United States\u2019 highest court has opted to not consider other Second Amendment cases, including in 2016, when it declined to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York. Those state laws were passed after 20 first graders and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn choosing to not hear those cases, \u201cthe justices have given at least tacit approval to broad gun control laws in states and localities that choose to enact them,\u201d wrote Adam Liptak, the legal affairs correspondent for The Times.\n\nBut to what effect?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to experts and research.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has \u201csuccessfully built in ineffectiveness\u201d to gun control legislation, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of the story is that the N.R.A. fights tooth and nail against any policy,\u201d Mr. Winkler said. \u201cThe laws that result are much less ambitious in their goals.\u201d\n\nThe gun control laws had some effect. The 1934 restrictions curbed access to machine guns; crimes with those types of fully automatic firearms have essentially dried up since the era of Al Capone. The 1968 prohibitions on who can own a weapon, and requirements for licensing dealers, are still in place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the \u201cban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that \u201cthe number of gun massacres fell by 37%\u201d while the ban was in place.\n\nChristopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident.\n\n\u201cMy work is often cited in misleading ways that don\u2019t give the full picture,\u201d Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. \u201cThese laws can modestly reduce shootings overall\u201d and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n\nMs. Feinstein\u2019s claim that the ban drastically reduced gun massacres comes from analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston. But Mr. Winkler noted that most mass shootings are committed with a handgun, not a military-grade assault weapon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no anti-mass shooting law to test,\u201d said Charles Branas, the chairman of the epidemiology department at the School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. \u201cIn terms of all of these instances, not just mass shootings, we need the politicians to create more laws to test.\u201d", "keywords": ["shootings", "gun", "weapons", "assault", "major", "end", "led", "york", "tougher", "law", "ban", "states", "firearms", "laws", "control"], "polarity": 0.08292673761423759, "subjectivity": 0.4366244288119286},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/politics/school-shooting-gun-debate.html", "text": "By evening, one anti-gun group had mobilized and already sent out its first email: \u201cRESOURCES + EXPERTS AVAILABLE: Florida High School Shooting.\u201d Another group, Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, activated the 1,500 members of its \u201csurvivors network,\u201d and soon paid $230,000 for an advertisement in The New York Times shaming pro-gun lawmakers.\n\nThe National Rifle Association followed its own playbook: remaining silent for several days \u2014 a recognition that its message might be unwelcome during the initial burst of grief. But it used its NRATV channel to argue to its members that more guns in schools could prevent massacres. Sales of so-called bump stocks, which can make a semiautomatic weapon fire like an automatic, rose out of fear that they would be banned.\n\nThe battles waged after shootings in Newtown, Conn.; Orlando, Fla.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., began playing out all over, presumably heading toward the same stalemate.\n\nBut this time, a few things are different: The gun control side has developed a well-financed infrastructure that did not exist when Mr. Barden\u2019s son Daniel and other schoolchildren were fatally shot at Sandy Hook. Within days of the Parkland shooting, one anti-gun group flooded Florida lawmakers with 2,500 calls and 1,700 emails opposing a bill allowing guns in schools.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother difference is an unpredictable president who belongs to the National Rifle Association and promotes the N.R.A.-favored solution of arming trained teachers but has also embraced a couple of modest gun control measures opposed by gun rights groups.\n\nAnd perhaps most dramatically, the We-Call-B.S. teenagers of Florida have injected a passionate new energy into a stale debate, organizing demonstrations, flooding the Statehouse in Tallahassee, composing songs, creating protest signs, confronting politicians and taking to TV airwaves with an intensity and composure and power rarely seen in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe initial reaction was the same kind of sickened resignation \u2014 this is one of the worst ever, and this probably won\u2019t be enough either,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a founder of Third Way, a center-left advocacy group in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat has changed since then is the kids and the extraordinary, galvanizing force they have become,\u201d he added, interrupting an interview to take a call from his 17-year-old son, whose class was leaving school to march to the White House. \u201cNo one knows when we are going to hit a tipping point on this issue. We may have hit it \u2014 we don\u2019t know. But if we did, it\u2019s because of them.\u201d\n\nStill, veterans of both sides said the fundamental dynamics of Washington have not changed. If President Barack Obama could not pass gun control in a Democratic-majority Senate in 2013, months after Sandy Hook, they said, it was unlikely that Mr. Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would.\n\nThe N.R.A. remains as potent as ever, and the debate resumes as Republicans head into a primary election season when many worry about challenges from the right. In December, the House passed a bill to bolster criminal background checks before gun purchases, but Republicans paired it with a provision requiring states to allow anyone to carry a concealed weapon if they are allowed to carry one in their home state, essentially making it a national right, anathema to Democrats, who have their own liberal base to satisfy.\n\nGun rights advocates also plan to focus on the failure of the F.B.I. to pursue tips about the suspected Florida gunman, arguing that blame should be on the federal authorities, not the firearms.\n\n\u201cWe have seen breakdowns in existing laws,\u201d Mr. Scalise said. \u201cBefore people talk about putting new laws on the books, when we find out that multiple laws on the books were not followed, that should be the first thing we figure out.\u201d\n\nThe rapid mobilization of the anti-gun movement is a phenomenon that has evolved with the emergence of lobbying groups filled with veteran political operatives and growing lists of supporters. By now they are used to it.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something necessarily robotic about how an organization like ours, in a professional way, responds to a mass shooting,\u201d said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a gun control group founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in the head in 2011.\n\nBut the response has been an outpouring of support. Moms Demand Action, the grass-roots arm of Everytown, has 100,000 volunteers in every state, with an email list of four million. Since the Parkland shooting, the group has added 75,000 members. In Georgia, 1,500 people turned up Wednesday at the State Capitol to lobby for gun laws, compared with 160 last year. In Minnesota, the group had 16 RSVPs before the shooting for a meeting on Tuesday; 300 people attended.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen Sandy Hook happened, the gun lobby was ready for us.

You win a vote here and there.\u201d\n\nBy last weekend, gun control groups were sending out fund-raising appeals. In recent days, some groups have begun quietly helping the students organize future activities, including a march on Washington on March 24 with hopes of drawing 500,000 people.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a week after the shooting, Dana Loesch, the N.R.A. spokeswoman, offered the group\u2019s first public defense of its position, enduring jeers at a CNN town hall-style meeting as she sought to focus attention away from broad new gun restrictions and toward preventing mentally ill people from buying weapons. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the days after the shooting, Mr. Trump consulted advisers as well as Chris W. Cox, the N.R.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist. The president called Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip, who was traveling in the Middle East, to discuss his bill with Mr. Murphy requiring states and federal agencies to report more often to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System offenses that would bar gun purchases.\n\n\u201cThese kids, they\u2019re organizing, they want action,\u201d an aide told Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI want action, too,\u201d he replied, according to another aide. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ran for president.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the request of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, Mr. Trump called a girl wounded in the attack, and afterward, the call seemed to remain on his mind, as he kept bringing it up with aides. Last Friday, he visited a Florida hospital and met victims, a visit still on his mind when he had dinner Saturday night at his Mar-a-Lago estate with his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, his daughter-in-law Lara and the Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera.\n\nThe president noted that the injuries he saw were more grisly than those portrayed in the movies. \u201cHe was definitely horrified by the severity, the savagery of those wounds that the children suffered,\u201d Mr. Rivera recalled. \u201cAnd he kept saying, \u2018How do you recover from that?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump mentioned tightening background checks. \u201cHe brought up how absurd it is that someone can buy a gun even though they\u2019re on the no-fly list,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. Asked for his opinion, Mr. Rivera suggested raising the minimum age to buy an assault rifle to 21 from 18.\n\nEric Trump, who like his brother is a big-game hunter, seemed to push back, noting that there are already more than 300 million guns in circulation in the United States, implying that new restrictions might be pointless.\n\nBut the president, in defiance of the N.R.A., has since publicly embraced the age increase and ordered the Justice Department to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.\n\nBy Thursday, Mr. Trump seemed to be following the lead of the N.R.A. again, talking enthusiastically of its proposal to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools. Still, he has taken different views of gun laws before. In \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d published in 2000 when he briefly ran for the Reform Party presidential nomination, Mr. Trump called both major parties extreme.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans walk the N.R.A. line and refuse even limited restrictions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump owns guns and has had a concealed weapon permit since 2010. When he set out to win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he was pressed by voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to support gun rights, an experience that aides said hardened his views. He dropped support for an assault rifle ban. \u201cI love the N.R.A.,\u201d he declared. \u201cI love the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nAt the White House this week, Mr. Trump hosted an emotionally packed session with survivors of the Parkland shooting. Outside the White House, high school students from around the Washington area \u2014 including Mr. Bennett\u2019s son \u2014 gathered, carrying signs with slogans like \u201cAbolish the N.R.A.\u201d and calling for legislation. \u201cNo more waiting!\u201d one student said into a microphone.\n\nWhether they change the outcome, the students have at least changed the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be traumatic for a long time,\u201d said Mr. Scalise, speaking from experience. \u201cThe fact that they want to get more engaged and find out what they can do to help to prevent this, I think, is courageous.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "shooting", "gun", "debate", "group", "trump", "support", "outcome", "nra", "florida", "laws", "control"], "polarity": 0.07370451770451769, "subjectivity": 0.4013366910866912},

But it is unclear whether federal prosecutors offices will share the enthusiasm, and whether there will be any recourse if the guidance is not heeded.\n\nGaps in the background check system have prompted scrutiny in an array of high-profile failures. Its three-day waiting period loophole allowed Dylann Roof, who in 2015 murdered nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church, to buy the gun used in the shooting, despite having been charged that same year with felony drug possession.\n\nDespite issuing a hold on his purchase, the F.B.I. did not get back to the local gun dealer who sold Mr. Roof the weapon he used in the shooting within the three-day waiting period. The dealer legally sold Mr. Roof the gun when he returned after the waiting period.\n\nIn November of last year, Devin P. Kelley killed 26 people at a Texas church with firearms that a background check should have indicated he was not permitted to purchase. Mr. Kelley\u2019s criminal record \u2014 he was kicked out of the Air Force after being convicted of domestic violence in 2014 \u2014 was never transmitted from the service to the F.B.I.\n\nMore recently, thousands of people with outstanding warrants were purged from the background check system over a discrepancy over the definition of the word \u201cfugitive,\u201d which the Justice Department said should not necessarily preclude someone from purchasing a firearm.", "keywords": ["waiting", "mr", "dealer", "period", "gun", "lying", "checks", "background", "justice", "roof", "purchase", "check", "dept", "firearms", "prosecutions", "prioritize"], "polarity": 0.09938930117501546, "subjectivity": 0.32535946196660476},

They decided to allow news cameras to capture the entire session anyway.\n\nIn private beforehand, Mr. Trump met in the Oval Office with Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow, was one of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last week.\n\n\u201cHe showed us nothing but love,\u201d Mr. Pollack said in an interview. \u201cThe guy really cared, you know? He flew us in, he had a bus waiting for us, he made time for us.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollack, who brought his wife, two sons and Meadow\u2019s longtime boyfriend, said Mr. Trump signed his son\u2019s white and gold \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d trucker hat and spoke at length with the family. The president insisted that he and his family, who had not planned to attend the listening session, accompany him through the iconic White House colonnade and into the event.\n\n\u201cHe took pictures of my daughter that we brought, and he said he was going to look at it every day,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe just said, \u2018You guys are coming with me,\u2019 and we were just talking about life as we walked,\u201d Mr. Pollack said. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular guy.

Credit Lukas Schulze/Getty Images\n\nThe White House\u2019s senior adviser on energy and climate change stepped down last week after being denied a full security clearance for smoking marijuana about five years ago. Now he is speaking his mind about the Paris climate agreement that President Trump has disavowed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to say something controversial,\u201d the former adviser, George David Banks , said in an interview. \u201cThe Paris agreement is a good Republican agreement. It\u2019s everything the Bush administration wanted.\u201d\n\nMr. Banks stood by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision last summer to withdraw the United States from the global accord, despite having urged him behind the scenes to remain in. Since then, a large part of his work as the White House adviser on international energy issues has been to quietly seek ways that the United States might rejoin the deal.\n\nThat came to an abrupt end last week when Mr. Banks resigned after being told he would not be granted a full security clearance. In a wide-ranging interview days after leaving his position, Mr. Banks spoke about the surprise of being told that the three or four times he had smoked marijuana between 2009 and 2013, which he had self-reported to the F.B.I. in April 2017, were the reason for the security rejection.\n\nHe also spoke about his efforts to persuade Mr. Trump to remain open-minded about the Paris agreement, and the likelihood of the United States formally rejoining the accord during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cA lot can happen between now and 2020 ,\u201d Mr. Banks said, referring to the date when countries can formally leave the Paris agreement. He pointed to the president\u2019s recent comment, which he made during a news conference with Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, that \u201cwe could conceivably go back in\u201d to the deal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still thinking about it,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cI think he wants to keep the option alive.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Banks joined the White House in February 2017 to serve on both the National Security Council and National Economic Council, the fight was just heating up over whether to remain in the accord or \u201ccancel\u201d it, as Mr. Trump had promised to do on the campaign trail.\n\nAs on other issues, including trade and immigration, the Trump White House was divided between moderates and hard-liners. Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, favored upholding the agreement. The charge to withdraw was led by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s administrator, Scott Pruitt, and by Steve Bannon, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist at the time.\n\nMr. Banks said he seized on other comments Mr. Trump had made during the campaign \u2014 that he would \u201crenegotiate\u201d a Paris deal \u2014 hoping there might be an opening to persuade the president to stay in. He made the case then, and continues to now, that the United States could simply weaken the target that former President Barack Obama had pledged \u2014 to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2014 while still remaining a member.\n\nMr. Trump ultimately rejected that argument, and declared in a ceremony in the Rose Garden last year that the Paris agreement \u201cdisadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\u201d The United States, he said, would immediately stop working toward its emissions target and would stop funding efforts to help developing countries tackle climate change. Mr. Trump has said several times since that he might reconsider his position if new, unspecified terms are made available.\n\nPreviously the executive vice president of the American Council for Capital Formation, a business-oriented think tank, Mr. Banks began his career as an economic analyst at the C.I.A. He served in the State Department and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, both under former President George W. Bush.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , the first United Nations-led climate agreement (which the United States signed but did not ratify), he had a hand in helping the Bush administration outline what a climate deal would need to look like to win American support. It was an effort, he said, that would help shape his outlook on the Paris deal.\n\nThe Senate in 1997 unanimously rejected the Kyoto Protocol because it demanded legally binding emissions cuts from industrialized countries while allowing developing nations to act voluntarily. For any future deal to be acceptable, Congress instructed, it would need to hold all countries equally legally accountable for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions goals offered by nations would need to be voluntary and \u201cbottom up\u201d \u2014 that is, not dictated by the United Nations but rather devised domestically so they could be enforceable at home.\n\nThose are essentially the parameters of the Paris agreement that the Obama administration negotiated with nearly 200 nations and finalized in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s a climate policy based on U.S. national interest that the Bush team started and the Obama team kept,\u201d Mr. Banks said.\n\nHe called Mr. Obama\u2019s emissions pledge \u201cawful,\u201d describing it as unrealistically high. He also criticized the Obama administration for failing to consult with Congress or industry in devising it. But, he said, \u201cI think probably the United States got the best deal it could as a framework.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and others who shaped the Paris agreement under the Obama administration argued the target was the same one the House of Representatives approved as part of climate legislation in 2009. As for the terms of the accord, they agreed with Mr. Banks, up to a point. The Obama administration was able to convince other countries to embrace the Bush-era terms, they said, precisely because it put forward an ambitious target that showed the world that America, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in history, was serious about tackling climate change.\n\n\u201cParis fixes the problems Republicans had with the Kyoto Protocol \u2014 all countries are in, and each country picks its own target,\u201d said Susan Biniaz, a former State Department legal adviser who worked on climate negotiations under both parties beginning in 1989. \u201cOn top of that, the targets aren\u2019t legally binding. It\u2019s what we who worked for the Bush administration tried to get, but it probably took a Democratic administration with more climate credibility to achieve it.\u201d\n\nThose who oppose the Paris agreement and reject mainstream climate science challenged Mr. Banks\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cThe Paris agreement was flawed from the beginning \u2014 a shortsighted approach that set unattainable targets for the United States while not holding international partners to the same standards,\u201d said Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who has called climate change a hoax. \u201cPresident Trump was right to withdraw from it.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request to comment on Mr. Banks\u2019s views.\n\nMr. Banks acknowledged that his was the minority position in an administration that ultimately was eager to keep Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise and to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s broader climate change agenda. Still, he insisted that Mr. Trump remains open to returning to the Paris agreement.\n\nMr. Banks argues that it would be in the interest of the United States, and even of fossil fuel industries, for America to rejoin the international discussion about curbing greenhouse gases. \u201cThe climate agenda is not going to go away any time soon, and if you\u2019re not engaged aggressively, actively, there are going to be policies that are detrimental to the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

Gardner, the Democratic prosecutor in St. Louis who brought the case before a grand jury. A contingent of allies of Mr. Greitens in the State Republican Party remained supportive on Friday, or stayed silent on the matter.\n\n\u201cMissourians should see this for what it is, a political hit job,\u201d said Sam Cooper, the executive director of the State Republican Party. \u201cWe have a progressive anti-law enforcement Democrat wanting to single-handedly oust a law-and-order governor.\u201d\n\nMr. Greitens, a first-time politician, had clashed with Republican lawmakers since taking office in January 2017. Mr. Greitens, a married father of two thought to have ambitions for higher office, admitted last month that he had an extramarital affair in 2015, before he was elected. But the governor has repeatedly denied reports that he took a compromising photo of the woman without permission and blackmailed her.\n\nThe felony indictment handed up Thursday by a St. Louis grand jury accused Mr. Greitens, 43, of photographing a nude or partially nude person in 2015 without consent, a charge that carries up to four years in prison if he is convicted. The governor\u2019s lawyers said that he violated no laws and that they were seeking to have the case dismissed.\n\nBut Missouri lawmakers could begin deciding whether to impeach Mr. Greitens even before he appears in court, on March 16, in the criminal case. Lawmakers are expected to file resolutions asking for an investigation of the invasion of privacy allegations as early as Monday, when they return to Jefferson City, the capital. Such resolutions are required to start an impeachment process under Missouri law.\n\nPhoto\n\nState Senator Caleb Rowden, a Republican, wrote that he would urge his colleagues \u201cto take all necessary actions to remove the governor from office\u201d if Mr. Greitens refuses to resign. Josh Hawley, the state attorney general who is seeking the Republican nomination for Ms. McCaskill\u2019s seat, called the indictment \u201ca serious matter\u201d and said \u201cthe criminal justice system must be allowed to work.\u201d And Kathie Conway, a state representative, said she would prefer that the governor step aside rather than risk impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to do nothing but be hurtful to him, to his wife, to those close to him,\u201d said Ms. Conway, a Republican from suburban St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s just a battle that I just don\u2019t want to be in the middle of.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTodd Richardson, the Republican speaker of the House, indicated that if Mr. Greitens remained in office, he would support an investigation of the governor \u2014 a move that could lead to impeachment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If a majority of House members voted to impeach, the State Senate would select a special commission of judges to try the case.\n\nLt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican who previously served as a sheriff and a state legislator, would become governor if Mr. Greitens left office.\n\nNational Republicans gave little indication that they were taking a stand on Mr. Greitens\u2019s case. But if lawmakers in Jefferson City move forward with impeachment, Republicans could be faced with months of headlines about a sex scandal in a year when they hope to maintain their large majorities in the Missouri General Assembly and to unseat Ms. McCaskill.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a real concern,\u201d said Ms. Conway, the legislator. \u201cThis is a fact: We have a Republican governor who\u2019s been indicted. We have a Senate seat that\u2019s up that\u2019s a very important seat to the party nationally.\u201d\n\nState Representative Galen Higdon, a Republican, said he did not yet know whether the governor\u2019s claims of a politically biased prosecution had merit. Mr. Higdon said he supported a legislative investigation of the governor\u2019s conduct, but was not yet calling on him to resign.\n\nYou \u201cdon\u2019t want a knee-jerk reaction to something like this,\u201d Mr. Higdon said. \u201cYou want to do your due diligence and take your time and figure out what\u2019s the best option.\u201d\n\nOthers came to the defense of Ms. Gardner and noted that grand jurors, not the prosecutor herself, made the decision to indict the governor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a witch hunt by any means,\u201d said Mr. Walker, the Republican lawmaker. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a governor who is corrupt or has done things that are illegal. And if you get a felony indictment against you, that\u2019s pretty serious.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "resign", "missouri", "office", "governor", "ms", "thats", "resists", "republican", "state", "pressure", "greitens", "indicted", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.07252763194252558, "subjectivity": 0.44072027263516633},

Hardly anyone made the kind of apocalyptic predictions that were constantly voiced during the 2016 campaign when he would do something outrageous.\n\nNot that conservatives are exactly overjoyed. The mood at the gathering this year was a testament to that. For much of the two-day event, the crowds seemed thinner and the atmosphere decidedly flatter than last year, when activists were still on a high from the Republicans\u2019 unexpected victory and greeted now-departed members of the administration like Stephen K. Bannon and Reince Priebus with a rapturous welcome.\n\nWhen administration officials like Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, spoke this week, they did so to a hall with row after row of empty seats.\n\nEnthusiasm may have been missing from much of the festivities this year. But Mr. Trump\u2019s influence was still apparent. Speakers borrowed signature phrases of his like \u201cfake news.\u201d Some, like Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, indulged the president\u2019s complaints that the Justice Department was engaged in a political witch hunt against him.\n\nNigel Farage, the British politician credited with helping push his country toward exiting the European Union, was a featured speaker.

That\u2019s a problem given that, in the last four downturns, the Fed has cut rates by an average of 5.5 percentage points to stimulate renewed growth.\n\nDuring the last downturn, the Fed reduced the benchmark rate to nearly zero in 2008, and then supplemented its efforts by pledging to keep interest rates at a low level and by purchasing large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds.\n\nFed officials have said that those policies benefited the economy, and could be used again during a future downturn. Other central banks have relied on similar policies in recent years, and have reached similar conclusions. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a board member of the European Central Bank, said economic research was \u201cfairly clear\u201d that such asset purchases helped to hold down interest rates.\n\nBut the main paper presented at the conference on Friday, which is hosted by the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, asserted that bond-buying had little economic benefit.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is that the most important and reliable instrument of monetary policy is the short term interest rate,\u201d wrote the authors, a team of two academics and two bank economists.\n\nThe danger of a rapid return to near-zero interest rates seemed particularly acute in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as the Fed repeatedly delayed any increase in rates. Now, the economy has gained strength and the Fed has raised rates five times. Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said the progress showed the Fed\u2019s policies had helped, and that the Fed might be able to raise interest rates above current expectations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Interest rates include expected inflation, so higher inflation would raise rates.\n\nEmbracing higher inflation, however, could cause political problems for the Fed.\n\nAlternatively, the Fed could tolerate higher inflation on a temporary basis. For example, the Fed could aim to maintain average inflation at 2 percent over some specified period, meaning that it would compensate for periods of lower inflation, as during the last six years, by allowing periods of higher inflation, thus maintaining a 2 percent average.\n\nLast year, the Fed began to include a comparison between its actual management of interest rates, and the results produced by alternative approaches to monetary policy.\n\nThe report on Friday included an inflation averaging approach among those alternatives for the first time.", "keywords": ["economy", "officials", "reserve", "downturn", "higher", "feds", "view", "policies", "grows", "rate", "federal", "fed", "frets", "rates", "inflation", "interest"], "polarity": 0.12539276060402818, "subjectivity": 0.3519584679795948},

When it comes to video games, he said, \u201cthe overwhelming majority of kids who play do not commit antisocial acts.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of American adults \u2014 including roughly equal numbers of men and women \u2014 play video games, whether on a computer, a TV, a gaming console, or a portable device like a cellphone or an iPad.\n\nIn Japan, about 60 percent of the population played video games in 2016, according to NewZoo, a gaming market research company. But almost no one is killed by a gun in the country, which bans possessing, carrying, selling, or buying handguns or rifles. There were only six gun deaths in Japan in 2014, compared with over 33,000 in the United States, according to GunPolicy.org, which tracks published reports on armed violence, firearm law and gun control.\n\nIn 2013, The New York Times looked at research on whether games negatively affect long-term behavior, and more recent science does not contradict these findings.\n\nA burst of new research has begun to clarify what can and cannot be said about the effects of violent gaming. Playing the games can and does stir hostile urges and mildly aggressive behavior in the short term. Moreover, youngsters who develop a gaming habit can become slightly more aggressive \u2014 as measured by clashes with peers, for instance \u2014 at least over a period of a year or two. Yet it is not at all clear whether, over longer periods, such a habit increases the likelihood that a person will commit a violent crime, like murder, rape or assault, much less a Newtown-like massacre.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/us/politics/trump-says-no-president-has-ever-cut-so-many-regulations-not-quite.html", "text": "The Trump administration has engaged in a sleight of hand to create the 22-1 ratio. And while Mr. Trump has made progress in his deregulatory agenda, his claims of achieving more success in one year than throughout the entire presidencies of any of his predecessors is hyperbole, not fact.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Newly Invented (And Inflated) 22-1 Ratio\n\nMr. Trump demanded the so-called \u201c2-for-1 rule\u201d in one of his first executive orders. He claims that it has been so successful that the federal government has actually eliminated 22 regulations for every one enacted.\n\nA White House fact sheet from December declared that the Trump administration had \u201cissued 67 deregulatory actions while imposing only three new regulatory actions.\u201d To back up its claim, the fact sheet cited a chart published by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs that described each of the actions.\n\nBut the chart \u2014 which the federal Regulatory Information Service Center says has never been compiled during earlier presidencies \u2014 raises more questions than it answers. For example:\n\n\u25a0 A database that is maintained by the White House regulatory affairs office outlines 34 \u201cderegulatory\u201d actions, compared to 67 in the chart. The White House did not respond to repeated inquiries to explain the discrepancy. \u25a0 Some items labeled \u201cderegulatory action\u201d clearly involve some regulation as well. For instance, one \u201cderegulatory action\u201d lifts a ban on imports of pitahaya, or dragon fruit, from Ecuador. But it also subjects the imports to new inspections requirements. Other actions are temporary, like the dismissal of a century-old shipping law to help hurricane aid efforts in Puerto Rico. Doing so was labeled a \u201cderegulatory action,\u201d although it only lasted 10 days and Mr. Trump declined to fully or permanently renew it. \u25a0 Not all actions are created equal. Three actions designated as \u201cregulatory\u201d were described as economically significant \u2014 meaning that they have an impact of $100 million or more. Only two \u201cderegulatory\u201d actions were considered economically significant. \u25a0 Of the 65 other \u201cderegulatory actions\u201d on the chart, 60 percent were either routine, administrative or otherwise not significant. About one-third of those efforts to roll back regulations began under President Barack Obama. And 10 do not appear to be rules \u2014 they are advisory notices or guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\u201cThe 22-1 ratio needs to be taken with a grain of salt,\u201d said Susan Dudley, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President George W. Bush.\n\nTrying to Claim the Deregulation Crown, Inaccurately\n\nIn October, Mr. Trump boasted that under his administration, \u201cwe have stopped or eliminated more regulations in the last eight months than any president has done during an entire term. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump later compared the deregulatory actions in his first year in office to all of those taken during the full \u201cfour years, eight years, or, in one instance, 16 years\u201d in all previous presidential administrations.\n\nNo American president has served for 16 years; Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four presidential terms but only served for 12 years before dying in office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBeyond that, comparing regulatory activity across administrations is an imperfect exercise. Standards for making and revoking rules are frequently changing, and courts and Congress can tweak and review them as well. But available metrics indicate that Mr. Trump is wrong to claim he has already stopped or eliminated more federal rules than any other president.\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs says it withdrew 635 rules in 2017 \u2014 a fast pace over a one-year period by any measure. But that is not more than any previous presidency \u2014 Mr. Obama withdrew 1,814 federal rules during his eight-year term and Mr. Bush eliminated 2,813 while in office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Program for Economic Research on Regulation, at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., combs the Federal Register to quantify the number of rule-making actions by regulatory agencies. University researchers found that federal regulations actually grew by about 0.65 percent during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office. They also noted that the rate of growth was slower than what it was annually from 1970 to 2016, when it averaged about 2.1 percent.\n\nExperts said that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to cut through the bureaucracy fall far short of the structural changes made under Ronald Reagan, who abolished entire regulatory agencies and eliminated some economic regulations in the transportation, telecommunications and energy industries. \u201cNothing Trump has done to date compares to that in terms of impact on Americans,\u201d Ms. Dudley said.\n\nCary Coglianese, the director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that \u201ca lot of the key institutions\u2019 processes that we have today, dealing with regulation, were established by Reagan.\u201d He pointed to the 1981 enactment of cost-benefit analyses and legal challenges to Mr. Reagan\u2019s deregulation policies that set current standards for administrative law, which govern how federal, state and local agencies operate.\n\nDeregulatory Successes and a Word of Caution\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s hyperbole not withstanding, he can claim some deregulatory successes.\n\nPrevious reports in The New York Times have detailed the Trump administration\u2019s lax enforcement of certain rules across several agencies. Early in his administration, Mr. Trump rolled back Obama-era rules though an unprecedented use of the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to \u201cdisapprove\u201d regulations issued within 90 days with the help of the president.\n\nDan Goldbeck of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit conservative group that promotes smaller government, said he sees a more concerted effort to streamline and trim back regulations under Mr. Trump than under many previous administrations.\n\nThe pace of consideration for significant regulations also has slowed. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reviewed 60 rules that were described as economically significant between Jan. 21, 2017, to Jan. 20, 2018. The last time so few federal rules were reviewed in one-year was 1984, under Mr. Reagan.\n\nRegulations, Going Forward\n\nThe federal regulatory system will continue to evolve throughout \u2014 and beyond \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s time in office. So will his own approach, experts said.\n\nSo far in the 2018 fiscal year, the administration has shifted its deregulation efforts toward making substantive changes through the regular rule-making process, Mr. Goldbeck said. As evidence, he pointed to a new rule to amend the federal meat inspection process that the Department of Agriculture estimates could save millions of dollars annually, according to a department estimate. \u201cBut expect to see a delay\u201d in how much fruit these efforts will bear Mr. Goldbeck said. \u201cThat\u2019s just nature of the process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has reversed at least one of his own decisions, backtracking on his waiver to regulate state government drug-testing rules.\n\nAdditionally, there is no guarantee that regulations that have been waived will survive legal challenges, nor that they will remain in place in future presidential administrations. Once agencies complete the rule-making process, Ms. Dudley said, \u201cthey will likely have to defend their deregulatory action in court, where they may or may not succeed.\u201d Congress also could later decide to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cRegulatory change is not forever.

Klein, who runs the Zionist Organization of America, a nonprofit group that is funded partly by Mr. Adelson. \u201cIt should be crystal-clear that this is the U.S. government making the decision to move it.\u201d\n\nThrough a representative, Mr. Adelson declined to comment on Friday. His offer of a donation was first reported by The Associated Press.\n\nSteve Goldstein, the under secretary for public diplomacy, said State Department lawyers began looking several weeks ago at whether it was legal to accept a private donation to build an embassy, a process that continues. He said the department was not currently negotiating with any private citizen for a donation, and that a new embassy building would take seven to 10 years to construct.\n\nIt was not clear whether private donors had ever helped with the financial costs to build an American embassy. Patrick Kennedy, who last year retired from the State Department, where he served as under secretary for management, said donors in the past had contributed millions of dollars to refurbish the palatial United States ambassadors\u2019 residences in London, Paris, Rome and Tokyo.\n\n\u201cAs long as a donor passes an ethics and background check, we\u2019ll take their money if they\u2019re willing to give it.

Friedman will relocate to an American consular office in Jerusalem\u2019s Arnona neighborhood that will temporarily serve as the United States\u2019 main diplomatic post in Israel.\n\nMr. Adelson is a longtime patron of Mr. Netanyahu. He has financed the newspaper Israel Hayom in an apparent attempt to help Mr. Netanyahu come to power and remain there.\n\nIsrael Hayom began publishing in 2007, when Mr. Netanyahu was still the leader of the opposition, and has deeply cut into the advertising base and readership of its main competitor, Yedioth Ahronoth, which has often been sharply critical of Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nMr. Adelson\u2019s offer to help fund a new embassy may have more to do with his staunchly pro-Israel stance and his relationship with Mr. Trump than his ties with Mr. Netanyahu. Those relations may have cooled as a result of the Israeli police\u2019s corruption investigations into Mr. Netanyahu, one of which directly involves his actions in the newspaper rivalry.\n\nMr. Netanyahu was recorded in meetings negotiating mutual benefits with an old foe, Arnon Mozes, who is the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth. The prime minister is accused of offering to help Yedioth Ahronoth financially in return for more positive coverage \u2014 including by curtailing the circulation of Israel Hayom, and limiting its weekend supplement.\n\nMr. Adelson has been questioned at least once by the Israeli authorities in connection with the case. The police have recommended charging Mr. Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\nWhile Israelis warmly welcomed the Trump administration\u2019s recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, analysts said the embassy move in May was unlikely to improve Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fortunes in the long term. In interviews, many Israelis said they had not even realized that the Americans did not consider Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Klein, of the Zionist Organization of America, described Mr. Adelson as \u201cvery excited\u201d when he was first told by Mr. Trump that the embassy would be moved to Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cIt is a critically important issue to Sheldon Adelson,\u201d Mr. Klein said in an interview on Friday.\n\nThe Arnona building where the temporary American Embassy will be housed, and the land adjacent to it, roughly straddles the seam between West Jerusalem, where Israelis live, and East Jerusalem, which is a largely Arab community. That would make it ideal for serving both Israeli and Palestinian populations, Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nThe United States has an option to purchase land adjacent to the Arnona building, a parcel that is big enough to handle an embassy, Mr. Kennedy said. Leases now in effect are likely to delay the transfer of the property until at least 2020, he said.\n\nEmbassies can cost anywhere from $150 million to nearly $1 billion to build. The one in Jerusalem is likely to cost somewhere in the middle of that range \u2014 about $500 million \u2014 because it does not need the housing, warehouse or security functions of some of the most expensive buildings, such as those in Baghdad and Kabul, Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nSome staff members at the American Embassy could remain in Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s business center.", "keywords": ["mr", "netanyahu", "jerusalem", "embassy", "pay", "supporter", "capital", "trump", "offers", "hardline", "adelson", "israels", "palestinian", "israel"], "polarity": 0.1077717019822283, "subjectivity": 0.40041695146958295},

Even in the United States since then, only two episodes have eclipsed that death toll, the massacres in an Orlando gay nightclub in 2016 and at a Las Vegas concert last year.\n\nIn response to the 1996 shooting, John Howard, then Australia\u2019s conservative prime minister, moved quickly, introducing a federal law to officially make guns a privilege, not a right. Gun owners were forced to provide a valid reason for owning a weapon, such as farming or hunting. Licensing rules were tightened, a 28-day waiting period for gun purchases was imposed and a national gun registry was established.\n\nVideo\n\nSemiautomatic rifles, like the one used at Port Arthur in 1996 and in Parkland last week, were severely restricted, and Australia engaged in a buyback program that took more than 650,000 firearms off the streets and generated attention around the world.\n\nGun control advocates in the United States regularly point to Australia when the other side says that new laws would not make a difference. President Barack Obama cited Australia as a model after a shooting in Oregon in 2015 and Hillary Clinton, running to succeed him against Mr. Trump, said the Australian approach was \u201cworth considering.\u201d\n\nThat was a theme picked up by Sam Zeif, 18, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, who was among the survivors of last week\u2019s shooting to visit the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, there was a shooting at a school in 1999,\u201d he told Mr. Trump, getting the date slightly off and mistaking the setting, which was actually a tourist site not a school. \u201cAnd you know, after that, they took a lot of ideas, they put legislation together and they stopped it. Can anyone here guess how many shootings there have been in the schools since then in Australia? Zero. We need to do something.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association has long pushed back against the Australia model, citing studies that it says do not prove that the restrictions have been effective. While it is true that Australia has not seen a mass shooting comparable to Port Arthur or Parkland since 1996, the N.R.A. argues that such episodes are rare enough that it would be statistically incorrect for gun control supporters to draw a cause-and-effect conclusion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWith such little evidence supporting their doctrines, these fanatics should spare Americans the proselytizing,\u201d Chris W. Cox, a top N.R.A. lobbyist, wrote in November. \u201cEven more to the point, the ongoing destruction of personal freedom in Australia stands as a stark and constant reminder of just how far gun control extremists are willing to go in their quest to disarm law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nPolls show more than 90 percent support in Australia for the two-decades-old gun regime, but it has also been gradually loosening its laws in recent years and gun sales are increasing. Those who own guns own more guns \u2014 in some cases, 100 or more. Semiautomatic handgun sales, which are not as regulated as rifles, have skyrocketed.\n\nData from GunPolicy.org, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for firearm policy data, shows that from 1988 to 2015, Australians surrendered roughly 1.1 million guns in various buybacks \u2014 and bought roughly 1 million new ones.\n\nPhoto\n\nExperts have debated the impact of Australia\u2019s program for years. Studies have showed that the combined policies enacted after the 1996 tragedy reduced mass shootings and suicides, with the largest declines in states that turned over the most weapons. There has been only one case of at least four people shot to death in Australia since 1996, a father who killed his wife and three children before killing himself in 2014.\n\nWhat the United States can learn from Australia, some experts said, is that guns should be viewed not just as the cause of mass killings, but also as a public health issue that leads to death in other ways.\n\n\u201cThe gun is to gun violence as the mosquito is to malaria,\u201d said Philip Alpers, a University of Sydney professor and founding director of GunPolicy.org. \u201cIt\u2019s the agent of harm and it needs to be treated in the same way it would be treat in any other public health campaign.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Then and now, the politics and the countries are more different than alike.\n\nMr. Howard had just won a landslide victory when he pushed gun control through parliament and, experts noted, Australia is a much smaller country with a population that tends to put more faith in government regulation.\n\n\u201cIf the question is: \u2018Would what Australia did work in the United States?\u2019 the answer is no,\u201d Mr. Alpers said. \u201cWhat Australia did was a confiscation of private property under the threat of jail time, compensated or not. That wouldn\u2019t wash in the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe scale also wouldn\u2019t wash in the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cAustralia is estimated to have confiscated nearly a third of its firearms \u2014 and that would entail destroying 90 million firearms in the United States.\u201d\n\nGun control advocates said that while Australia deserves to be seen as a model, it would be a mistake to oversimplify the country\u2019s success or assume that gun violence can be forever erased.\n\n\u201cAustralian politicians have been riding on the coattails of John Howard and letting the gains slip away,\u201d said Samantha Lee, chair of Gun Control Australia.", "keywords": ["reject", "shooting", "australias", "gun", "australian", "model", "united", "mass", "guns", "trump", "1996", "australia", "comparisons", "turnbull", "states", "control"], "polarity": 0.10052023557837511, "subjectivity": 0.37912497386334587},

Ms. Trump, using time-tested diplomatic language, told reporters she would \u201creaffirm our commitment to our maximum-pressure campaign to ensure that the Korean Peninsula is denuclearized.\u201d\n\nUnder Mr. Moon\u2019s liberal government, South Korea has responded positively to North Korea\u2019s proposal of dialogue. That has caused strains with the Trump administration, which fears that premature diplomatic contacts could undermine the pressure campaign.\n\nMr. Moon left no doubt about his appetite for engagement on Friday. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s participation in the Winter Olympic Games,\u201d he said, \u201chas served as an opportunity for us to engage in active discussions between the two Koreas and this has led to lowering of tensions on the peninsula.\u201d\n\nAt Mr. Moon\u2019s prodding, the White House now says it would be open to holding preliminary talks with North Korea, too, a shift from its earlier refusal to do so until Pyongyang stopped its provocative nuclear and missile tests. But the administration\u2019s messages on North Korea remain contradictory, veering from openness to threats of force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy sending his telegenic daughter, Mr. Trump is projecting soft power and possibly countering Mr. Kim\u2019s well-received decision two weeks ago to send his 30-year-old sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony. Mr. Trump also authorized a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and North Korean officials when he sent Mr. Pence as his emissary to the Games\u2019 opening ceremony. The North Koreans, put off by the vice president\u2019s harsh criticism, canceled at the last minute.\n\nBut the sanctions underscore Mr. Trump\u2019s readiness to use hard power. The administration described the ones announced this week as the strongest package yet \u2014 a distinction that has been true of multiple previous rounds.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThe administration is trying to do both of these things simultaneously, and the issue is whether it will work,\u201d said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, who was involved in diplomacy during the Clinton administration that led to a nuclear agreement in 1994.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a North Korean,\u201d he added, \u201cyou might conclude that their efforts at diplomacy aren\u2019t sincere, that they\u2019re faking it.\u201d\n\nMr. Wit said, however, that he expected the administration to continue to explore ways to engage North Korea. Part of the problem, officials said, is that in the administration, there remains a division between those in the State Department who favor diplomacy and those in the National Security Council who favor a harder line.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the Treasury Department was not prepared to release them at the time, a senior official said, and it has been scrambling to catch up ever since.\n\nIn the past, the United States has gone after ships suspected of transporting missiles and nuclear proliferation material. But stopping vessels suspected of carrying commercial goods, experts said, would be a major step up in the pressure campaign against Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cThat goes into the realm of an economic blockade,\u201d said Abraham M. Denmark, a former Pentagon official who is now the director of the Asia program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cIt would be moving beyond proliferation and going after things that sustain North Korea\u2019s economic lifeline.\u201d\n\nSuch a move, he predicted, will meet resistance from China and Russia. Those countries thwarted an effort in December by the administration to put a provision into the latest United Nations Security Council resolution on North Korea that would permit countries to hail and board North Korean ships in international waters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to China, the Treasury Department sanctioned ships from North Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Marshall Islands, Tanzania, Panama, and Comoros. It did not blacklist ships or companies from Russia, even though that country is suspected of supporting the illicit trade.\n\nA senior administration official said the United States had raised concerns about smuggling with Russia and had previously designated Russian entities with links to North Korea.\n\n\u201cWhether they\u2019re Russian ships, whether they\u2019re Chinese ships \u2014 we don\u2019t care whose ships they are,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIf we have intelligence that people are doing things, we will put sanctions on them.\u201d\n\nHe said the 28 ships blacklisted \u2014 with names like Oriental Treasure, Asia Bridge 1 and Koti \u2014 constituted virtually all the vessels currently known to engage in prohibited trade with North Korea.\n\nAs Mr. Mnuchin spoke in the White House briefing room, large boards behind him showed satellite images of a ship-to-ship transfer in December involving a North Korean and a Panamanian vessel. The identity of the North Korean ship had been masked with a Chinese name and home port.\n\nThe American military has begun contingency planning to stop and board suspect vessels bound for North Korea. But it is a perilous undertaking.\n\nNavy or Marine warships would deploy small boats carrying troops who are trained in what the Pentagon calls visit, board, search and seizure operations. Once aboard, military officials said, the search party would have two options: sweep the ship and turn it back over to its crew or, if ordered by their commanders, seize it.\n\nThe military, however, has options short of boarding, officials said. It could track suspect vessels, by sea or with P-3 or P-8 surveillance planes, until they make port. The United States or its allies could then call on that nation to inspect the ship\u2019s cargo to determine whether it violated existing United Nations sanctions.\n\nEvan S. Medeiros, an Asia director in the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said, \u201cThe administration is walking right up to the line of what\u2019s permissible under international law to aggressively increase the pressure on North Korea.\u201d", "keywords": ["korea", "harsh", "mr", "koreas", "korean", "announces", "united", "administration", "trump", "north", "ships", "sanctions"], "polarity": 0.040166316526610644, "subjectivity": 0.2957391138273491},

Kennedy, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. It banned interstate mail orders of all firearms, interstate handgun sales and weapons with no \u201csporting purpose.\u201d It prohibited the sale of firearms to minors, felons, fugitives, drug addicts and those committed to a mental institution. And it required gun manufacturers and dealers to be licensed and maintain records of sales.\n\n\u25a0 After an intense lobbying effort by gun advocates, the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act of 1986 lifted some of those restrictions. The 1986 law allowed dealers to sell rifles and shotguns through the mail, and it limited federal inspections of gun dealers. It also prohibited the sale of machine guns manufactured after May 19, 1986.\n\nWe Want to Hear From You Will arming and training more teachers make schools safer?

However, private transactions were exempted, creating the so-called gun-show loophole.\n\n\u25a0 The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned the possession, transfer or domestic manufacturing of some semiautomatic assault weapons for 10 years. Known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, it expired in 2004, despite efforts by gun control advocates to extend it.\n\n\u25a0 In 2008, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act after a shooting at Virginia Tech a year earlier had killed 33.

Two other states regulate military-grade firearms. State gun laws are tracked, in detail, by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for gun control.\n\nAccording to the law center, states with the strictest gun control measures have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths. Those states include California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome state gun control laws have come under court review. In one prominent case, the Supreme Court limited gun control efforts in its 2009 ruling District of Columbia v. Heller.\n\nSince then, however, the United States\u2019 highest court has opted to not consider other Second Amendment cases, including in 2016, when it declined to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York. Those state laws were passed after 20 first graders and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn choosing to not hear those cases, \u201cthe justices have given at least tacit approval to broad gun control laws in states and localities that choose to enact them,\u201d wrote Adam Liptak, the legal affairs correspondent for The Times.\n\nBut to what effect?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to experts and research.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has \u201csuccessfully built in ineffectiveness\u201d to gun control legislation, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of the story is that the N.R.A. fights tooth and nail against any policy,\u201d Mr. Winkler said. \u201cThe laws that result are much less ambitious in their goals.\u201d\n\nThe gun control laws had some effect. The 1934 restrictions curbed access to machine guns; crimes with those types of fully automatic firearms have essentially dried up since the era of Al Capone. The 1968 prohibitions on who can own a weapon, and requirements for licensing dealers, are still in place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the \u201cban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that \u201cthe number of gun massacres fell by 37%\u201d while the ban was in place.\n\nChristopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident.\n\n\u201cMy work is often cited in misleading ways that don\u2019t give the full picture,\u201d Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. \u201cThese laws can modestly reduce shootings overall\u201d and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n\nMs. Feinstein\u2019s claim that the ban drastically reduced gun massacres comes from analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston. But Mr. Winkler noted that most mass shootings are committed with a handgun, not a military-grade assault weapon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no anti-mass shooting law to test,\u201d said Charles Branas, the chairman of the epidemiology department at the School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. \u201cIn terms of all of these instances, not just mass shootings, we need the politicians to create more laws to test.\u201d", "keywords": ["shootings", "gun", "weapons", "assault", "major", "end", "led", "york", "tougher", "law", "ban", "states", "firearms", "laws", "control"], "polarity": 0.08292673761423759, "subjectivity": 0.4366244288119286},

Video Charles Whitman opened fire on the University of Texas campus in 1966. Since then, the images of school shootings across America are almost indistinguishable.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Around 2:30 p.m. on Valentine\u2019s Day, President Trump was in the study off the Oval Office when John F. Kelly, his chief of staff, arrived with news of a school shooting in Florida. Mr. Trump shook his head, according to an aide, and muttered, \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\nMark Barden was visiting a playground named for his 7-year-old son killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School when a friend texted him: Be careful watching television. It\u2019s happening. Again.\n\nHis senator, Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, heard about the Florida shooting while he was on his way to the Senate floor and ripped up his speech to declare that through inaction, \u201cwe are responsible\u201d for a mass atrocity. Again.\n\nRepresentative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip and gun rights supporter who was himself grievously wounded last year when a man opened fire at a congressional baseball practice, huddled with colleagues on the House floor, reliving his horror. He knew what was coming: the activists who in his view would exploit tragedies like his to advance their anti-gun agenda. Again.\n\nWithin hours of the blood bath in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and adults were killed on Feb. 14, the machinery of the American gun debate began grinding into motion.\n\nBy evening, one anti-gun group had mobilized and already sent out its first email: \u201cRESOURCES + EXPERTS AVAILABLE: Florida High School Shooting.\u201d Another group, Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, activated the 1,500 members of its \u201csurvivors network,\u201d and soon paid $230,000 for an advertisement in The New York Times shaming pro-gun lawmakers.\n\nThe National Rifle Association followed its own playbook: remaining silent for several days \u2014 a recognition that its message might be unwelcome during the initial burst of grief. But it used its NRATV channel to argue to its members that more guns in schools could prevent massacres. Sales of so-called bump stocks, which can make a semiautomatic weapon fire like an automatic, rose out of fear that they would be banned.\n\nThe battles waged after shootings in Newtown, Conn.; Orlando, Fla.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., began playing out all over, presumably heading toward the same stalemate.\n\nBut this time, a few things are different: The gun control side has developed a well-financed infrastructure that did not exist when Mr. Barden\u2019s son Daniel and other schoolchildren were fatally shot at Sandy Hook. Within days of the Parkland shooting, one anti-gun group flooded Florida lawmakers with 2,500 calls and 1,700 emails opposing a bill allowing guns in schools.\n\nImage A memorial banner at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were fatally shot last week. Credit Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters\n\nAnother difference is an unpredictable president who belongs to the National Rifle Association and promotes the N.R.A.-favored solution of arming trained teachers but has also embraced a couple of modest gun control measures opposed by gun rights groups.\n\nAnd perhaps most dramatically, the We-Call-B.S. teenagers of Florida have injected a passionate new energy into a stale debate, organizing demonstrations, flooding the Statehouse in Tallahassee, composing songs, creating protest signs, confronting politicians and taking to TV airwaves with an intensity and composure and power rarely seen in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe initial reaction was the same kind of sickened resignation \u2014 this is one of the worst ever, and this probably won\u2019t be enough either,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a founder of Third Way, a center-left advocacy group in Washington.\n\n\u201cWhat has changed since then is the kids and the extraordinary, galvanizing force they have become,\u201d he added, interrupting an interview to take a call from his 17-year-old son, whose class was leaving school to march to the White House. \u201cNo one knows when we are going to hit a tipping point on this issue. We may have hit it \u2014 we don\u2019t know. But if we did, it\u2019s because of them.\u201d\n\nStill, veterans of both sides said the fundamental dynamics of Washington have not changed. If President Barack Obama could not pass gun control in a Democratic-majority Senate in 2013, months after Sandy Hook, they said, it was unlikely that Mr. Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would.\n\nThe N.R.A. remains as potent as ever, and the debate resumes as Republicans head into a primary election season when many worry about challenges from the right. In December, the House passed a bill to bolster criminal background checks before gun purchases, but Republicans paired it with a provision requiring states to allow anyone to carry a concealed weapon if they are allowed to carry one in their home state, essentially making it a national right, anathema to Democrats, who have their own liberal base to satisfy.\n\nGun rights advocates also plan to focus on the failure of the F.B.I. to pursue tips about the suspected Florida gunman, arguing that blame should be on the federal authorities, not the firearms.\n\n\u201cWe have seen breakdowns in existing laws,\u201d Mr. Scalise said. \u201cBefore people talk about putting new laws on the books, when we find out that multiple laws on the books were not followed, that should be the first thing we figure out.\u201d\n\nThe rapid mobilization of the anti-gun movement is a phenomenon that has evolved with the emergence of lobbying groups filled with veteran political operatives and growing lists of supporters. By now they are used to it.\n\nImage Wayne LaPierre, the chief of the National Rifle Association, criticized Democrats on Thursday for calling for more gun control laws. Credit Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something necessarily robotic about how an organization like ours, in a professional way, responds to a mass shooting,\u201d said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a gun control group founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in the head in 2011.\n\nBut the response has been an outpouring of support. Moms Demand Action, the grass-roots arm of Everytown, has 100,000 volunteers in every state, with an email list of four million. Since the Parkland shooting, the group has added 75,000 members. In Georgia, 1,500 people turned up Wednesday at the State Capitol to lobby for gun laws, compared with 160 last year. In Minnesota, the group had 16 RSVPs before the shooting for a meeting on Tuesday; 300 people attended.\n\n\u201cWhen Sandy Hook happened, the gun lobby was ready for us. They had been preparing for 20 years to take down those parents,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, recalling that few Democratic lawmakers were willing to appear on television criticizing the N.R.A. \u201cThere was no anti-gun movement. It just didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nNow, he said, \u201cthere is an increasingly mature political movement that can combine with the unique moral authority of the kids.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said each episode cracks the wall of resistance to new gun laws. \u201cEach time you do think it\u2019s a little different and people will move,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to believe it\u2019s cumulative and you win more support. You win a vote here and there.\u201d\n\nBy last weekend, gun control groups were sending out fund-raising appeals. In recent days, some groups have begun quietly helping the students organize future activities, including a march on Washington on March 24 with hopes of drawing 500,000 people.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a week after the shooting, Dana Loesch, the N.R.A. spokeswoman, offered the group\u2019s first public defense of its position, enduring jeers at a CNN town hall-style meeting as she sought to focus attention away from broad new gun restrictions and toward preventing mentally ill people from buying weapons. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the days after the shooting, Mr. Trump consulted advisers as well as Chris W. Cox, the N.R.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist. The president called Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip, who was traveling in the Middle East, to discuss his bill with Mr. Murphy requiring states and federal agencies to report more often to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System offenses that would bar gun purchases.\n\n\u201cThese kids, they\u2019re organizing, they want action,\u201d an aide told Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI want action, too,\u201d he replied, according to another aide. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ran for president.\u201d\n\nImage Cameron Kasky, a student at Stoneman Douglas, spoke to students who walked out of their schools on Wednesday in Parkland.

Rick Scott of Florida, Mr. Trump called a girl wounded in the attack, and afterward, the call seemed to remain on his mind, as he kept bringing it up with aides. Last Friday, he visited a Florida hospital and met victims, a visit still on his mind when he had dinner Saturday night at his Mar-a-Lago estate with his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, his daughter-in-law Lara and the Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera.\n\nThe president noted that the injuries he saw were more grisly than those portrayed in the movies. \u201cHe was definitely horrified by the severity, the savagery of those wounds that the children suffered,\u201d Mr. Rivera recalled. \u201cAnd he kept saying, \u2018How do you recover from that?\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump mentioned tightening background checks. \u201cHe brought up how absurd it is that someone can buy a gun even though they\u2019re on the no-fly list,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. Asked for his opinion, Mr. Rivera suggested raising the minimum age to buy an assault rifle to 21 from 18.\n\nEric Trump, who like his brother is a big-game hunter, seemed to push back, noting that there are already more than 300 million guns in circulation in the United States, implying that new restrictions might be pointless.\n\nBut the president, in defiance of the N.R.A., has since publicly embraced the age increase and ordered the Justice Department to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.\n\nBy Thursday, Mr. Trump seemed to be following the lead of the N.R.A. again, talking enthusiastically of its proposal to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools. Still, he has taken different views of gun laws before. In \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d published in 2000 when he briefly ran for the Reform Party presidential nomination, Mr. Trump called both major parties extreme.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans walk the N.R.A. line and refuse even limited restrictions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump owns guns and has had a concealed weapon permit since 2010. When he set out to win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he was pressed by voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to support gun rights, an experience that aides said hardened his views. He dropped support for an assault rifle ban. \u201cI love the N.R.A.,\u201d he declared. \u201cI love the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nAt the White House this week, Mr. Trump hosted an emotionally packed session with survivors of the Parkland shooting. Outside the White House, high school students from around the Washington area \u2014 including Mr. Bennett\u2019s son \u2014 gathered, carrying signs with slogans like \u201cAbolish the N.R.A.\u201d and calling for legislation. \u201cNo more waiting!\u201d one student said into a microphone.\n\nWhether they change the outcome, the students have at least changed the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be traumatic for a long time,\u201d said Mr. Scalise, speaking from experience. \u201cThe fact that they want to get more engaged and find out what they can do to help to prevent this, I think, is courageous.\u201d\n\nFollow Peter Baker and Michael Shear on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @shearm.

But it is unclear whether federal prosecutors offices will share the enthusiasm, and whether there will be any recourse if the guidance is not heeded.\n\nGaps in the background check system have prompted scrutiny in an array of high-profile failures. Its three-day waiting period loophole allowed Dylann Roof, who in 2015 murdered nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church, to buy the gun used in the shooting, despite having been charged that same year with felony drug possession.\n\nDespite issuing a hold on his purchase, the F.B.I. did not get back to the local gun dealer who sold Mr. Roof the weapon he used in the shooting within the three-day waiting period. The dealer legally sold Mr. Roof the gun when he returned after the waiting period.\n\nIn November of last year, Devin P. Kelley killed 26 people at a Texas church with firearms that a background check should have indicated he was not permitted to purchase.

Credit Lukas Schulze/Getty Images\n\nThe White House\u2019s senior adviser on energy and climate change stepped down last week after being denied a full security clearance for smoking marijuana about five years ago. Now he is speaking his mind about the Paris climate agreement that President Trump has disavowed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to say something controversial,\u201d the former adviser, George David Banks , said in an interview. \u201cThe Paris agreement is a good Republican agreement. It\u2019s everything the Bush administration wanted.\u201d\n\nMr. Banks stood by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision last summer to withdraw the United States from the global accord, despite having urged him behind the scenes to remain in. Since then, a large part of his work as the White House adviser on international energy issues has been to quietly seek ways that the United States might rejoin the deal.\n\nThat came to an abrupt end last week when Mr. Banks resigned after being told he would not be granted a full security clearance. In a wide-ranging interview days after leaving his position, Mr. Banks spoke about the surprise of being told that the three or four times he had smoked marijuana between 2009 and 2013, which he had self-reported to the F.B.I. in April 2017, were the reason for the security rejection.\n\nHe also spoke about his efforts to persuade Mr. Trump to remain open-minded about the Paris agreement, and the likelihood of the United States formally rejoining the accord during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cA lot can happen between now and 2020 ,\u201d Mr. Banks said, referring to the date when countries can formally leave the Paris agreement. He pointed to the president\u2019s recent comment, which he made during a news conference with Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, that \u201cwe could conceivably go back in\u201d to the deal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still thinking about it,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cI think he wants to keep the option alive.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Banks joined the White House in February 2017 to serve on both the National Security Council and National Economic Council, the fight was just heating up over whether to remain in the accord or \u201ccancel\u201d it, as Mr. Trump had promised to do on the campaign trail.\n\nAs on other issues, including trade and immigration, the Trump White House was divided between moderates and hard-liners. Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, favored upholding the agreement. The charge to withdraw was led by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s administrator, Scott Pruitt, and by Steve Bannon, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist at the time.\n\nMr. Banks said he seized on other comments Mr. Trump had made during the campaign \u2014 that he would \u201crenegotiate\u201d a Paris deal \u2014 hoping there might be an opening to persuade the president to stay in. He made the case then, and continues to now, that the United States could simply weaken the target that former President Barack Obama had pledged \u2014 to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2014 while still remaining a member.\n\nMr. Trump ultimately rejected that argument, and declared in a ceremony in the Rose Garden last year that the Paris agreement \u201cdisadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\u201d The United States, he said, would immediately stop working toward its emissions target and would stop funding efforts to help developing countries tackle climate change. Mr. Trump has said several times since that he might reconsider his position if new, unspecified terms are made available.\n\nPreviously the executive vice president of the American Council for Capital Formation, a business-oriented think tank, Mr. Banks began his career as an economic analyst at the C.I.A. He served in the State Department and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, both under former President George W. Bush.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , the first United Nations-led climate agreement (which the United States signed but did not ratify), he had a hand in helping the Bush administration outline what a climate deal would need to look like to win American support. It was an effort, he said, that would help shape his outlook on the Paris deal.\n\nThe Senate in 1997 unanimously rejected the Kyoto Protocol because it demanded legally binding emissions cuts from industrialized countries while allowing developing nations to act voluntarily. For any future deal to be acceptable, Congress instructed, it would need to hold all countries equally legally accountable for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions goals offered by nations would need to be voluntary and \u201cbottom up\u201d \u2014 that is, not dictated by the United Nations but rather devised domestically so they could be enforceable at home.\n\nThose are essentially the parameters of the Paris agreement that the Obama administration negotiated with nearly 200 nations and finalized in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s a climate policy based on U.S. national interest that the Bush team started and the Obama team kept,\u201d Mr. Banks said.\n\nHe called Mr. Obama\u2019s emissions pledge \u201cawful,\u201d describing it as unrealistically high. He also criticized the Obama administration for failing to consult with Congress or industry in devising it. But, he said, \u201cI think probably the United States got the best deal it could as a framework.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and others who shaped the Paris agreement under the Obama administration argued the target was the same one the House of Representatives approved as part of climate legislation in 2009. As for the terms of the accord, they agreed with Mr. Banks, up to a point. The Obama administration was able to convince other countries to embrace the Bush-era terms, they said, precisely because it put forward an ambitious target that showed the world that America, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in history, was serious about tackling climate change.\n\n\u201cParis fixes the problems Republicans had with the Kyoto Protocol \u2014 all countries are in, and each country picks its own target,\u201d said Susan Biniaz, a former State Department legal adviser who worked on climate negotiations under both parties beginning in 1989. \u201cOn top of that, the targets aren\u2019t legally binding. It\u2019s what we who worked for the Bush administration tried to get, but it probably took a Democratic administration with more climate credibility to achieve it.\u201d\n\nThose who oppose the Paris agreement and reject mainstream climate science challenged Mr. Banks\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cThe Paris agreement was flawed from the beginning \u2014 a shortsighted approach that set unattainable targets for the United States while not holding international partners to the same standards,\u201d said Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who has called climate change a hoax. \u201cPresident Trump was right to withdraw from it.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request to comment on Mr. Banks\u2019s views.\n\nMr. Banks acknowledged that his was the minority position in an administration that ultimately was eager to keep Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise and to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s broader climate change agenda. Still, he insisted that Mr. Trump remains open to returning to the Paris agreement.\n\nMr. Banks argues that it would be in the interest of the United States, and even of fossil fuel industries, for America to rejoin the international discussion about curbing greenhouse gases. \u201cThe climate agenda is not going to go away any time soon, and if you\u2019re not engaged aggressively, actively, there are going to be policies that are detrimental to the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position. Elliott and Blaney will be in the second row after winning the qualifying duels Thursday.\n\nOne driver in particular has the potential to do more than anyone to shake up the sport. A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do. So embrace it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe child of a white father and a black mother, Wallace said that he does not quite understand why his skin color makes him newsworthy in 2018. But he knows that stock car racing, with its Southern roots and the Confederate flags that still wave from some fans\u2019 campers and cars, has not attracted an African-American audience.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["diversity", "racing", "su\u00e1rez", "leader", "hes", "drive", "sport", "generation", "africanamerican", "nascar", "emerge", "wallace", "waits", "petty"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth.

At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white.

South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["zuma", "distinctive", "mr", "mess", "black", "africa", "apartheid", "zumas", "jacob", "economic", "whats", "white", "south", "corruption"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["black", "race", "work", "simpson", "evoking", "world", "art", "woman", "cant", "began", "seen", "images", "simpsons"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us.

I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["immigration", "mr", "voters", "ms13", "democrats", "gillespies", "win", "ads", "vote", "republicans", "white", "virginia"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["matter", "showed", "black", "renaissance", "harlem", "lives", "movement", "white", "americans", "blacks", "america"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["diversity", "racing", "su\u00e1rez", "leader", "hes", "drive", "sport", "generation", "africanamerican", "nascar", "emerge", "wallace", "waits", "petty"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected).

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["immigration", "effect", "united", "nonwhite", "color", "trump", "sign", "states", "white", "immigrants", "population", "wants", "america"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["zuma", "distinctive", "mr", "mess", "black", "africa", "apartheid", "zumas", "jacob", "economic", "whats", "white", "south", "corruption"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["politics", "mr", "black", "ms", "portrait", "washington", "fact", "wiley", "obama", "portraits", "obamas", "paint", "blend", "sherald", "fiction"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["immigration", "mr", "voters", "ms13", "democrats", "gillespies", "win", "ads", "vote", "republicans", "white", "virginia"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["matter", "showed", "black", "renaissance", "harlem", "lives", "movement", "white", "americans", "blacks", "america"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967}
