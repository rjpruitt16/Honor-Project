Ryan, with President Trump at the Capitol on Thursday. Credit Erin Schaff for The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump, ignoring the advice of his own lawyers, lashed out on Twitter over the weekend at the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, raising questions about whether he is laying the groundwork to try to fire him.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets alarmed some Republicans, who spoke out on Sunday morning talk shows. To assess reaction within the party, The New York Times reached out to Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate, as well as Republican members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and other leading Republicans.\n\nRepublican congressional leadership\n\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan\n\nHis spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, released the following statement: \u201cAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Steve Scalise\n\nThe Republican whip, from Louisiana\n\n\u201cI agree with the House Intelligence Committee's report concluding that there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in the 2016 election, and I think there are credibility concerns the Mueller investigation needs to address so they can dispel the fears that this is becoming a partisan witch hunt.\n\n\u201cThe credibility of the Mueller investigation will be in doubt unless we get to the bottom of the many serious questions regarding the F.B.I.'s handling of their investigation of the Trump campaign, as well as their investigation into Hillary Clinton's negligent transmission of classified material over her unauthorized email server. That's why I agree with the many others who have called for the appointment of an additional special counsel who, unlike Mueller, has the authority to look into the potential abuses of the FISA system that allowed the Democrat-funded Steele dossier to serve as the basis for the initial F.B.I. investigation.\n\n\u201cThe addition of an outside special counsel will ensure our ability to have full faith in our investigations into the very serious threats Putin's rogue government poses to our elections and nation as a whole.\u201d\n\nHave not commented\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee\n\nSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader\n\nCongressional Intelligence Committees\n\nThe Times reached out to every Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Some appeared on television Sunday morning.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida\n\n\u201cI remain confident that the special counsel is going to \u2014 is going to conduct a probe that is fair and thorough and is going to arrive at the truth and is \u2014 and is not going to go down rabbit holes that are not places that we need to be going,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC.\n\nSenator James Lankford of Oklahoma\n\n\u201cThe clearest thing that I can explain from that is the president\u2019s exceptionally frustrated, that he wants to be able to see this investigation come to an end,\u201d Mr. Lankford said on the ABC program \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nMr. Lankford added: \u201cSo it\u2019s not that Mueller has found nothing, it\u2019s that the president seems to be very, very frustrated that they\u2019ve not connected anything to him and they \u2014 he wants to be able to move on. I would say the best thing the special counsel can do is to finish the investigation, gather all the information that\u2019s needed, come to a conclusion so the American people can make their own decisions.\u201d\n\nHave not commented\n\nSenator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee\n\nSenator Roy Blunt of Missouri\n\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine\n\nSenator Tom Cotton of Arkansas\n\nSenator Jim Risch of Idaho\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee\n\nChairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees\n\nHave not commented\n\nSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nRepresentative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\n\nOther prominent Republican lawmakers\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona\n\nChairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee\n\nSenator Jeff Flake of Arizona\n\n\u201cPeople see that as a massive red line that can\u2019t be crossed,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d referring to any move to fire Mr. Mueller. He added that he hoped Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers would prevail on him not to do that. \u201cWe have confidence in Mueller.\u201d\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\n\n\u201cIf he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we\u2019re a rule-of-law nation,\u201d he said on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d also referring to firing Mr. Mueller. \u201cWhen it comes to Mr. Mueller, he is following the evidence where it takes him, and I think it\u2019s very important he be allowed to do his job without interference, and there are many Republicans who share my view.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina\n\n\u201cI would just counsel the president \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a very, very long, bad 2018, and it\u2019s going to be distracting from other things that he wants to do and he was elected do,\u201d Mr. Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cLet it play out its course. If you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.\u201d\n\nSheryl Gay Stolberg covers Congress.

Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not parties to this conflict,\u201d replied Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping them,,\u201d Ms. Hirono shot back. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling the Saudis.\u201d\n\nAmerican advisers do not give direct or indirect approval on target selection or execution of bombings, Pentagon officials say. Rather, they give advice on targeting procedures and facilitate checks of a list of \u201cno-strike\u201d buildings, like mosques and marketplaces. More recently, they have helped the Saudis to improve the effectiveness of their Patriot antimissile systems, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe can help them. We can advise them. We can share our lessons learned on how to more effectively apply their capabilities,\u201d General Votel said.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the general acknowledged that the military does not track where an American-refueled Saudi jet is going, what targets it strikes or the results of that mission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYemen, one of the poorest nations in the Arab world, has been convulsed by civil strife since the Houthis, Shiite rebels from the north aligned with Iran, stormed the capital, Sana, in 2014 and ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the Americans\u2019 main counterterrorism partner.\n\nIn March 2015, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab nations began a military campaign aimed at pushing back the Houthis and restoring the government. That campaign has so far failed to do so, and has instead caused the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crisis, with the worst outbreak of cholera in contemporary history and widespread child malnutrition.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was a tacit acknowledgment of the weaknesses of the Saudi armed forces.\n\nHuman rights groups say that Saudi Arabia has failed to meet its promises. \u201cSaudi Arabia had made pledges to make its engagement in Yemen less deadly and destructive,\u201d said Scott Paul, a policy specialist on Yemen at Oxfam America. \u201cWe do see the stark evidence that the situation has continued to deteriorate \u2014 innocent civilians continue to be caught up and killed in this crisis.\u201d\n\nA report to the United Nations Security Council in January described coalition \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d as \u201clargely inadequate and ineffective,\u201d and said that \u201cthe use of precision-guided weapons is a strong indicator that the intended targets were those affected by the airstrikes.\u201d\n\nWith Saudi Arabia flying as many as 200 missions a day in Yemen, the kingdom is seeking to buy more of those precision-guided weapons. Thomas A. Kennedy, the chief executive of Raytheon, met with State Department officials this month to promote the proposed sale of munitions to Saudi Arabia and the Emirates.\n\n\u201cWe value our 50-year partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and look forward to continuing to help meet their security needs,\u201d said Michael F. Doble, a spokesman for Raytheon.\n\nThe purchase, said William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, would be \u201csubstantial by standards of U.S.-Saudi trade in munitions, certainly one of the largest if not the largest for systems of the kind it likely includes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2017, the United States sold roughly $610 million in weapons and munitions to Saudi Arabia and $48 million in firearms to the Emirates. Bigger equipment, however, such as missile defense systems, made up a large portion of the purchases for both countries over the past year.\n\nDuring his trip to Saudi Arabia last year, his first overseas visit as president, Mr. Trump offered the kingdom a $110 billion arms package. A portion of his pledge \u2014 roughly $23.7 billion \u2014 had already been authorized under the Obama administration.\n\nHuman rights groups have long tied American-made weapons to the conflict in Yemen. A May 2017 report from Human Rights Watch said that Raytheon-made munitions had been used in at least four Saudi-led coalition strikes on innocents.\n\nIn one such attack, 31 civilians were killed and another 42 were wounded, according to the report. Human Rights Watch recovered a portion of one of the bombs used in the strike that had Raytheon production markings and a manufacture date of October 2015.", "keywords": ["visit", "congress", "military", "yemen", "saudi", "united", "rights", "main", "munitions", "implores", "administration", "saudis", "aid", "arabia", "continue", "block", "weapons"], "polarity": 0.03661270236612703, "subjectivity": 0.32375466998754665},

Minnesota Confronts a National Quandary                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/school-discipline-disparities-white-black-students.html", "text": "Then another group followed them to lobby for keeping the guidance.\n\nA retired Minnesota teacher set off a conservative media blitz by linking the Obama-era guidance to frustrations that teachers have with violent students, raising the issue high enough for the White House to latch on after the Parkland massacre. The coverage prompted Republicans to speculate about whether relaxed disciplinary policies had allowed the violent track record of Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the shooting, to evade law enforcement.\n\nDebbie York, the teacher who raised the issue in a Breitbart News article, was forced to retire after a first grader in her suburban Minnesota school pushed her, injuring her back and neck. The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident.\n\nThe story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers\u2019 authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms. Ms. York is advocating that the law go national, and that the Obama guidance be repealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about arming teachers with guns; it is about arming them with the freedom to talk about troubled kids whose behavior not only needs to be assessed, but when the behavior puts others at risk of serious harm, intervention other than therapy,\u201d Ms. York said.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been eyeing the guidance for reversal since she took office, will head a White House commission on school safety that has been specifically tasked with examining whether to repeal the discipline guidance.\n\nCivil rights groups and congressional Democrats are standing by the guidance and pointing to evidence that suspensions are helping to drive the achievement gap between white and minority students. Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators\u2019 perception of both.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pressure cooker,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the district\u2019s chief of schools. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across America.\u201d\n\nWhile critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.\n\nBernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["national", "guidance", "district", "punished", "quandary", "white", "districts", "confronts", "ms", "discipline", "school", "minnesota", "students", "black", "teachers"], "polarity": 0.034482293662621545, "subjectivity": 0.3891631183024627},

(He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)\n\nMost ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.\n\n\u201cI would have to see who\u2019s running,\u201d said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Ms. Newman is vying to unseat Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Chicago Democrat, in a primary there on Tuesday.\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi, 77, must contend with colleagues from her own generation who want their turn in charge, as well as younger Democrats who\u2019d prefer to clear out the party\u2019s entire septuagenarian leadership team: beyond Ms. Pelosi, the other two ranking House Democrats, Mr. Hoyer and James E. Clyburn, are 78 and 77.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet at a time when women are at the forefront of the opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 volunteering, donating and running for office in record numbers \u2014 the specter of Democrats taking back the House only to unceremoniously dump the most powerful woman in American politics strikes many in the party as outrageous.\n\nAnd Ms. Pelosi herself is plainly in this camp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a woman at the table,\u201d she said in the interview Friday before getting on a plane for Houston, where she was going to raise money for House Democrats at the annual rodeo there.\n\nPhoto\n\nDemonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.\n\n\u201cI am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.\n\n\u201cIf I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,\u201d she said.\n\nEven as energy on the left has soared across the country thanks to Mr. Trump, tensions among House Democrats are brewing inside the Capitol. Should Democrats fail to reclaim the House in a year with so many factors in their favor, Ms. Pelosi and her long-serving lieutenants will almost certainly be pushed to step down.\n\nYet some in the caucus want to see new leadership no matter what. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, hosted Mr. Crowley at a St. Patrick\u2019s Day-themed event last week and unexpectedly announced that he would back Mr. Crowley for leader. Mr. Pascrell, 81, said the culture of the House was changing.\n\n\u201cA lot of new people will be coming in and I think we should start fresh,\u201d Mr. Pascrell said, adding almost apologetically of Ms. Pelosi: \u201cShe\u2019s taken a lot of crap from Republicans and Democrats and she\u2019s really been above it all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said he had also encouraged Mr. Crowley to run for speaker.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHaving Joe be the leader of this party next session would be a welcome change,\u201d said Mr. Vela, 55, adding that Ms. Pelosi \u201churts our candidates\u201d in competitive districts.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Crowley has been inviting groups of younger lawmakers to meet for coffee and pastries in his office, reaching out to high-profile newer members like Joaquin Castro of Texas and Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Crowley declined to rule out taking on Ms. Pelosi. Asked if he was seeking commitments for a future race, Mr. Crowley said only that \u201cI have been talking to my colleagues about what they and we can do to help put us in the majority.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi dismissed the idea of a challenge from Mr. Crowley, who briefly considered challenging her after the 2016 election, and her aides pointedly noted that at an event in New York last week, he introduced her as \u201csoon to be speaker again.\u201d\n\nMr. Hoyer, in turn, has pitched himself to colleagues as a transitional House speaker, according to multiple lawmakers who have spoken with him \u2014 a steady hand through the 2020 elections, and perhaps no further. Katie Grant, his spokeswoman, said he was \u201cfocused on taking back the House.\u201d\n\nPart of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s challenge owes to the changing nature of fund-raising: Mr. Lamb raised over $4 million from mostly online contributors, the same way other Democrats are attracting donations. That has raised questions about just how much Ms. Pelosi\u2019s vaunted fund-raising prowess still matters.\n\n\u201cIt weakens the leverage of party leaders,\u201d Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who challenged Ms. Pelosi after the 2016 elections, said of the new fund-raising tools.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet some Democrats predicted that if the party rides an electoral wave back to power, Ms. Pelosi would reap much of the credit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf we take the majority, I completely assume that Leader Pelosi will be Speaker Pelosi,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California.\n\nThe most plausible scenario for Ms. Pelosi to exit, Democrats believe, is one in which the party just barely wins control of the House. A number of new lawmakers would have pledged not to vote for her, and several Democrats oppose her as a matter of routine, potentially denying her the 218 votes needed to secure the speakership.\n\n\u201cI think it will be left up to the new membership,\u201d said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, noting that freshman lawmakers and the rest of the caucus should \u201cwork their will.\u201d That could doom Ms. Pelosi, especially if more Democrats follow Mr. Lamb\u2019s approach.\n\nAt least three of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cred to blue\u201d candidates \u2014 recruits designated as top priorities by the D.C.C.C. \u2014 have signaled they would prefer a leader other than Ms. Pelosi. In Minnesota, Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman challenging Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, has called for a \u201cnew generation of leadership.\u201d In Washington State, Lisa Brown, a former state senator who is challenging Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the Republican leadership, said \u201cthere\u2019s room for new blood in all the caucuses in Congress.\u201d\n\nAnd Paul Davis, who is running for an open seat in Kansas, is flatly opposed to Ms. Pelosi. He said a change was \u201cbadly needed\u201d and lamented leaders who are \u201ctoxic in this part of the country.\u201d\n\nBut there is unease with Ms. Pelosi in solid-blue districts, too. In two Boston-area districts, neither the Democratic incumbents nor their more progressive rivals have committed to backing Ms. Pelosi. Brianna Wu, a liberal activist opposing Representative Stephen F. Lynch in a Democratic primary, said she was worried Democrats would suffer from Ms. Pelosi\u2019s \u201cinability to express a vision for the party.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a moderate Democrat, said he had encouraged other congressional hopefuls to oppose Ms. Pelosi if necessary.\n\n\u201cI have liberals back home, the one thing they really like about me is the fact that I voted against Nancy,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what candidate you are, it\u2019s not necessarily a bad message.\u201d", "keywords": ["democrats", "mr", "representative", "crowley", "democrat", "democratic", "lead", "pelosi", "candidates", "sure", "house", "ms", "speaker", "wants", "arent", "nancy"], "polarity": 0.10015747537486669, "subjectivity": 0.39682351464960147},

The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev disputed that he overpaid for the property, saying that the sale was negotiated down from an asking price of $125 million and that it predated an upheaval in the Palm Beach real estate market.

Mr. McCabe has identified as a lifelong Republican but did not vote in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe existence of his memos was first reported by The Associated Press.\n\nMr. McCabe was fired less than two days before his retirement.

{"title": "\n                    Trump and the Truth: A President Tests His Own Credibility                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/trump-truth-lies.html", "text": "The lack of fidelity to facts has real-world consequences in both foreign affairs and domestic policymaking. Foreign diplomats and lawmakers of both parties say they do not assume anything he says is necessarily true. In a White House where one aide described the existence of \u201calternative facts\u201d and another acknowledged telling \u201cwhite lies,\u201d staff members scramble to defend his claims without putting their own credibility on the line. News organizations debate when to use the word \u201clie\u201d because it implies intent.\n\nSince Mr. Trump became a presidential candidate, PolitiFact has evaluated more than 500 assertions and found 69 percent of them mostly false, false or \u201cpants on fire\u201d false. By comparison, it judged 26 percent of the statements by Mr. Obama that it evaluated as false and the same percentage for those by Hillary Clinton.\n\nThese are not scientific measurements, of course, because the selection of statements for examination is inherently subjective and focused on those that seem questionable, rather than a gauge of all public comments. Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders say fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact are politically biased, which Mr. Adair and his counterparts adamantly deny. But even among Republicans examined by PolitiFact, Mr. Trump is an outlier.\n\nWhile PolitiFact did not exist during most of President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure, it has found that 42 percent of statements that it examined by Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, the two previous Republican presidential nominees, were false. The party\u2019s congressional leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, judged on far fewer statements, were both at similar levels, 43 percent and 41 percent.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters rarely defend him as a truth teller, but argue that all presidents lie and point to false statements made by his predecessors, like Bill Clinton (Monica Lewinsky), Mr. Bush (Iraq) and Mr. Obama (health care).\n\nAdvisers say privately that Mr. Trump may not always be precise but is speaking a larger truth that many Americans understand. Flyspecking, tut-tutting critics in the news media, they say, fail to grasp the connection he has with a section of the country that feels profoundly misled by a self-serving establishment. To them, the particular facts do not matter as much as this deeper truth.\n\n\u201cI think presidents, all of them, actually have a habit of thinking that they\u2019re right, whether they\u2019re right or not,\u201d said Patrick H. Caddell, a political consultant who shared research with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s more guilty of that than some sort of preplanned and mendacious statements.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Caddell, a strategist for Jimmy Carter when he was beaten up by the media as na\u00efve for promising never to tell a lie, said Americans see Mr. Trump in context. \u201cIn Washington, D.C., facts don\u2019t matter; people have narratives, including the media, and they just ignore anything that doesn\u2019t fit that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should the American people punish him when they think the entire political culture\u201d is that way?\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s reported conversation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada occurred during a St. Louis fund-raiser on Wednesday for Josh Hawley, a Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. Reporters were not permitted in the room, but an audio recording was later obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nAs Mr. Trump told the story, the Canadian leader assured him that the United States did not have a trade deficit with Canada.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript published by The Post. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know. Josh, I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She later said on Twitter that the president was referring only to trade in goods, not trade in both goods and services, the common measurement.\n\nBut the point was that Mr. Trump acknowledged to the donors that he made the claim having no idea whether it was right or wrong. And it was not even the only time that day he made false statements.\n\nIn a public conversation at a Boeing factory in St. Louis, he lauded the number of jobs created on his watch and said \u201cnobody would have believed that could have happened.\u201d But in fact, 2.5 million new jobs were created in his first 13 months as president, almost exactly the same as the 2.6 million created in the 13 months before he became president and Mr. Obama was in the White House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a businessman, Mr. Trump often fabricated or exaggerated to sell a narrative or advance his interests. In his memoir, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d he called it \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d or \u201cinnocent exaggeration.\u201d\n\nWhen trying to lure investors to a casino project, he had bulldozers dig on one side of the site and dump the dirt on the other to give the impression that the project was making progress. He would call reporters and pretend to be a publicity agent for himself named John Barron or John Miller. He claimed to earn $1 million from a speech when it was $400,000. He claimed to be worth $3.5 billion when seeking a bank loan, four times what the bank eventually found.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a salesman and that\u2019s not about telling the truth, that\u2019s not the DNA about being a salesman,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, the author of \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President,\u201d a biography of his family. \u201cThe DNA of being a salesman is telling people what they want to hear. And he\u2019s got it.\u201d\n\nJack O\u2019Donnell, who was president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, recalled Mr. Trump telling New Jersey authorities that he had secured bank financing for a new casino and would not use junk bonds, only to turn around and then use junk bonds.\n\n\u201cIn my experience with him, there are times when he just compulsively lies and there are times when he strategically lies,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell, who wrote a scathing book about Mr. Trump. \u201cIn both regards, after he says something, I do think he believes that whatever he says becomes his reality. That\u2019s my experience with him. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big but it certainly can be.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump continued his practice as president. The Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker documented 2,140 false or misleading claims in Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office, a rate of nearly six a day, many of them repeated even after he was corrected.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll in January showed that only 35 percent of Americans consider him honest, while 60 percent do not. In their first terms, more than 50 percent considered Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama honest, although those numbers fell for both by their second terms.\n\nRepublicans as well as Democrats express concern. Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, has a new book coming out in May called \u201cGaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us.\u201d On the cover is an illustration of Mr. Trump with a Pinocchio nose.\n\nHer explanation is that Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters do not see deception, they see a commitment to winning. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s lies and fabrications don\u2019t horrify America,\u201d says the publisher\u2019s summary of her book. \u201cThey enthrall us.\u201d", "keywords": ["president", "mr", "lies", "trumps", "statements", "credibility", "white", "wrong", "trump", "false", "trade", "tests", "truth"], "polarity": 0.044688273036487314, "subjectivity": 0.4499777752009896},

Such a move could set off alarms among Republicans in Congress, who have largely stood by as the president repeatedly assailed the Justice Department and the F.B.I.\n\nMr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking on behalf of the president but later backed off that assertion. He did not elaborate on why he was calling for the end of the investigation, saying only: \u201cJust end it on the merits in light of recent revelations.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the president were skeptical that Mr. Dowd was acting on his own. Mr. Trump has a history of using advisers to publicly test a message, giving him some distance from it. And Mr. Dowd\u2019s comments came at a time when members of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team are jockeying to stay in his favor.\n\nHours later, the president echoed Mr. Dowd\u2019s accusations of corruption in the theoretical \u201cdeep state\u201d that Mr. Trump has long cast as a boogeyman working to undermine him.\n\n\u201cThere was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets, posted on a Saturday in which he remained inside the White House with no public schedule, came as Mr. Mueller is said to have sent questions to Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team as part of negotiations over an interview with the president. Mr. Mueller is seeking the interview, according to two people close to the White House, in order to ask follow-up questions, but put forward the list as a start.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Dowd\u2019s remarks about Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation represented an extraordinary shift in public strategy for the Trump legal team. Since taking over the case last summer, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have urged a strategy of restraint, in which the president avoids discussing Mr. Mueller or criticizing him, and the lawyers had done nothing publicly until now that could agitate the special counsel\u2019s team.\n\nThe comments by both Mr. Trump and Mr. Dowd lent credence to Mr. McCabe\u2019s assertion that the president sees his firing as directly tied into Mr. Mueller\u2019s case. Mr. McCabe, who is a potential witness in the investigation, declared that his dismissal was an attempt to undermine it.\n\nMr. Sessions fired Mr. McCabe for failing to be forthcoming with the department\u2019s internal watchdog about a conversation he authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist.\n\nLike Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe also kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president and his conversations with Mr. Comey, a person close to Mr. McCabe said on Saturday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump also asked him to end an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The special counsel is investigating both matters.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s memos were left at the F.B.I., which means that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s account.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers had no comment on Saturday, and Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly defended the special counsel, including in an interview this month with USA Today, in which he said he had seen no need to fire Mr. Mueller.\n\nMr. Comey, who has a book scheduled to be published next month, weighed in himself.\n\n\u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnd they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters have tried to undercut the investigation as part of a broader attempt to clear him of wrongdoing. This month, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 which is led by a close ally of the president, Representative Devin Nunes of California \u2014 concluded their own investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling, saying they had determined the president did nothing wrong. Democrats on the panel accused Republicans of putting partisan politics ahead of fact finding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee tied to Terry McAuliffe, a Hillary Clinton ally, for a Virginia State Senate race, praised Mr. McCabe\u2019s ouster again on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife\u2019s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation?\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHow many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration as the special counsel investigation has shown more signs of accelerating rather than ending. His legal team has worked to keep him from firing Mr. Mueller in the past. To keep the president at bay, the lawyers \u2014 led by the White House lawyer Ty Cobb \u2014 told him that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation would be over by last December and that they would ask Mr. Mueller to put out a statement saying the president was not a target of the investigation.\n\nBut instead, Mr. Trump was livid anew this week over the Times report that Mr. Mueller had subpoenaed his corporate records, including those related to Russia, according to one person close to the White House.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers appear to be feeling increasingly uneasy about where they stand. This month, Mr. Trump met with a veteran Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, to discuss coming on board to take over the president\u2019s dealings with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office and possibly replacing Donald F. McGahn II as White House counsel. The president\u2019s personal lawyers, Mr. Dowd and Jay Sekulow, did not know about the meeting, prompting concerns that they could be pushed aside, and potentially making them less resistant to Mr. Trump\u2019s whims about handling the inquiry.\n\nLast June, Mr. Trump backed down from his demand that Mr. Mueller be fired after Mr. McGahn threatened to quit. A month later, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family\u2019s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. After the Trump Organization subpoena was revealed on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers privately tried to play it down, in part to keep the president and his family calm.\n\nMr. Dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing episodes in recent months. In December, he said he had written a tweet posted by the president that implied Mr. Trump knew that Mr. Flynn had lied to the F.B.I. when Mr. Trump fired him.\n\nMonths earlier, Mr. Dowd was overheard by a Times reporter discussing details of a dispute inside the president\u2019s legal team over lunch at a Washington steakhouse.\n\nDemocrats seized on Mr. Dowd\u2019s statement on Saturday.

Chief, Plots His Political Future                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/climate/scott-pruitt-political-ambitions.html", "text": "Mr. Pruitt has faced criticism, and received a reprimand from his boss, for spending more than $107,000 of public money on first-class air travel. But he remains a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s, and after the past week of White House turmoil \u2014 with the president dismissing his secretary of state and intimating that a greater shake-up may follow \u2014 Mr. Pruitt appears to have job security that could work to his advantage over time.\n\nThe endgame, say people who have spoken with Mr. Pruitt, is a possible run at the presidency in 2024 or later. \u201cIt was always known among elite Republicans that this guy had higher ambitions,\u201d said Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. \u201cThe question was just, \u2018Does he want to be president, or does he want to be attorney general?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo jump from E.P.A. chief to any of those posts would be highly unusual for the head of a historically wonky, low-profile agency. \u201cThe take has always been that E.P.A. is where your political career goes to die,\u201d said William K. Reilly, who headed the agency under President George Bush.\n\nEven in Republican administrations, Mr. Reilly said, the job historically involved imposing regulations on polluting industries, which can create powerful enemies. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of job that if you do it right, you antagonize a lot of people \u2014 big industry, even your own president,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Pruitt has flipped the script. As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. 14 times, and he has spent the past year working to undo regulations that would have required farmers to restrict their fertilizer use; oil and gas firms to control global warming pollution from their wells; and Midwestern power plants to burn less coal.\n\n\u201cHe has made a big splash,\u201d Mr. Reilly said. \u201cThe mission he is on is not one that his predecessors at E.P.A. have recognized. And it could be a good strategy to win the constituency that elected the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s precise political path forward is not certain. He is viewed as a likely candidate to run for a Senate seat in Oklahoma in 2020 if the incumbent, James Inhofe, retires. But it remains unclear if Mr. Inhofe, 83, will do so, and his office declined to comment. There is also speculation that Mr. Pruitt might jump in as a last-minute candidate in this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen asked about its boss\u2019s ambitions, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s staff emphasizes that he is focused only on the job at hand. It also notes that the E.P.A. chief has made a significant effort to promote his work. \u201cAdministrator Pruitt has utilized a wide array of news outlets to advance President Trump\u2019s agenda on regulatory certainty and environmental stewardship,\u201d his spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, wrote in an email. Through Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Pruitt declined an interview request.\n\nSome former E.P.A. chiefs noted that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s unusual speed at attempting to dismantle regulations could mean that those efforts might not stand up to later legal challenges. \u201cThe policies he\u2019s pushing play very well in his home state and with the base \u2014 but you can\u2019t do them overnight,\u201d said Christine Todd Whitman, who headed the E.P.A. in the George W. Bush administration and before that was the governor of New Jersey. \u201cThey\u2019re getting rushed out. I don\u2019t think the homework is being done. It makes for good sound bites, but they might not stand up legally.\u201d\n\nThat might not affect Mr. Pruitt\u2019s longer-term political aspirations, though. \u201cPruitt could be gone from E.P.A. by the time that happens,\u201d Ms. Whitman said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The rule has been particularly unpopular with the rural voters who make up the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s base. This year, Mr. Pruitt announced he would freeze implementation of the rule and issue a more farmer-friendly version by the spring.\n\nLast year, Mr. Pruitt made two trips to Iowa, a key campaign state in presidential elections, to talk about his agenda. In the summer, he met with farmers to tout his rollback of the clean water regulation. In December, he promised that the E.P.A. would not use regulations to curb the production of corn ethanol \u2014 an issue considered key for presidential candidates in Iowa.\n\nMr. Pruitt has also halted implementation of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules, which would have frozen construction of new coal-fired power plants, and has said he intends to propose a replacement rule this year. Last April, he spoke at a Pennsylvania coal mine, telling workers that \u201cthe regulatory assault is over.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Mr. Pruitt has spent time with major political donors. Last year he met with Foster Friess, a Republican fund-raiser, and with investors connected to Sheldon Adelson, the party megadonor, according to meeting records obtained by The New York Times. He also met with Steven Chancellor, an Indiana coal executive and Republican fund-raiser, according to documents obtained by the Sierra Club and published by Politico.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAll of this is unusual,\u201d Ms. Whitman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a federal position, you should not appear to be campaigning.\u201d\n\nWere Mr. Inhofe, long known as Congress\u2019s most vocal opponent of efforts to fight global warming, to retire, Mr. Pruitt would be a natural fit to try to win his Senate seat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pruitt, who keeps his watch set to the time in Oklahoma even when he is working on the East Coast, has traveled to his home state regularly. Last March through May he spent 43 out of 92 days in Oklahoma or traveling to or from the state, according to a report by the Environmental Integrity Project.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s rise to prominence in Oklahoma began during the eight years he managed and co-owned the Oklahoma City RedHawks, a minor league baseball team. He won a seat in the State Legislature and opened a small legal office, Christian Legal Services, to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights.\n\nAs an owner of the RedHawks, Mr. Pruitt ran television ads that featured himself promoting the team. They gave him statewide recognition and played a role in his 2010 race for attorney general, said Chris Wilson, an Oklahoma-based Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cHe had instant name recognition,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.\n\nAs attorney general, Mr. Pruitt built close ties with the state\u2019s oil and natural gas industry. A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send to the E.P.A., on state stationery, outlining the economic hardship of environmental regulations on their industries.\n\nThe ties have paid off politically. Harold G. Hamm, who advised the presidential campaigns of Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney and is the chief executive of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, was a co-chairman of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s 2013 re-election campaign.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s tenure at the E.P.A. has already proven popular with the oil and natural gas industry. His proposals have been aimed at loosening regulations, particularly an Obama-era rule that would have required companies to rein in emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from new oil and gas wells. (A federal appeals court later ruled that the effort was illegal.)\n\nEnergy companies were also delighted when Mr. Pruitt flew to Morocco in December, in an unusual trip aimed at promoting exports of natural gas. That trip received criticism, though, in part because the E.P.A. does not oversee natural gas exports.\n\nThe E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general is investigating some of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s trips, including the one to Morocco and some to Oklahoma, but it is not clear whether that will be a liability. \u201cIt\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s not fatal,\u201d Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised the Trump campaign, said referring to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s airline expenses. \u201cNone of the old rules seem to apply,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current president seems to have erased a lot of them.\u201d", "keywords": ["future", "pruitt", "president", "mr", "oklahoma", "trumps", "gas", "rule", "political", "scott", "regulations", "plots", "state", "epa", "chief", "pruitts", "rulecutting"], "polarity": 0.10251257751257753, "subjectivity": 0.42126135876135873},

Mr. McCabe, who stepped down in January and took a leave of absence, denied the accusation and appealed this week to senior career officials in the Justice Department.\n\nLack of candor is a fireable offense at the F.B.I., but Mr. McCabe\u2019s last-minute dismissal was carried out against a highly politicized backdrop.\n\nMr. McCabe was among the first at the F.B.I. to scrutinize possible Trump campaign ties to Russia. And he is a potential witness to the question of whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump has taunted Mr. McCabe both publicly and privately, and Republican allies have cast him as the center of a \u201cdeep state\u201d effort to undermine the Trump presidency.\n\nAs a witness, Mr. McCabe would be in a position to corroborate the testimony of the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who kept contemporaneous notes on his conversations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump prodded him to publicly exonerate the president on the question of Russian collusion and encouraged him to shut down an investigation into his national security adviser.\n\nIn a statement released by his lawyers, Mr. McCabe said his firing was part of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201congoing war on the F.B.I.\u201d and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. He said he answered questions truthfully in the internal investigation and contacted investigators to correct the record when he believed they misunderstood him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McCabe, a 21-year F.B.I. veteran, was eligible for a government pension if he retired on Sunday. The firing jeopardizes that benefit, though it was not immediately clear how much he might lose.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said the president\u2019s public attacks were aimed at several targets. \u201cThe real damage is being done to the F.B.I., law enforcement and the special counsel,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McCabe was the F.B.I.\u2019s second in command during one of the most tumultuous periods in the bureau\u2019s history. He oversaw investigations into both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server \u2014 and he dealt with the fallout from both. He became the acting F.B.I. director after the sudden firing of his boss, Mr. Comey, and he publicly contradicted the White House on national television over whether Mr. Comey had lost the support of rank-and-file F.B.I. agents.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly singled him out for public attack, suggesting that he helped protect Mrs. Clinton from prosecution during the 2016 presidential campaign. As evidence, he pointed to the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nAs recently as Thursday, even as the White House said it left Mr. McCabe\u2019s fate in Mr. Sessions\u2019s hands, officials there left little doubt where the president stood. \u201cIt is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyer called those comments \u201cvile and defamatory\u201d and said they were intended to put pressure on the Justice Department. \u201cThis intervention by the White House in the D.O.J. disciplinary process is unprecedented, deeply unfair and dangerous,\u201d said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost her race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mrs. McCabe\u2019s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.\n\nThe president is not involved in the firing decisions of career employees like Mr. McCabe. His firing had been recommended by veteran disciplinary officials. But Mr. Trump\u2019s statements loom large over the decision, which is why previous presidents have typically refrained from wading into law enforcement and personnel matters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report faults Mr. McCabe for his lack of candor in interviews with internal investigators. The report has not been released, but people briefed on it say the allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which reported in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family\u2019s foundation.\n\nMr. McCabe, working through the F.B.I. press office, authorized a spokesman and a bureau lawyer to speak with The Journal in order to rebut allegations that Mr. McCabe had slowed down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the article ultimately noted, Mr. McCabe had insisted that his agents had the authority to investigate the foundation, even if the Justice Department refused to authorize grand jury subpoenas.\n\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Mr. Comey groomed him for senior leadership from a young age, rankling some agents who saw him as too academic and not enough of a traditional crime-fighter. But senior F.B.I. officials and his counterparts in other agencies praised his intellect and ability to manage complicated worldwide national security issues.", "keywords": ["scorn", "mr", "fbi", "andrew", "trumps", "justice", "investigation", "comey", "fired", "mccabes", "trump", "questions", "firing", "candor", "mccabe", "target", "officials"], "polarity": 0.034621623102635765, "subjectivity": 0.36245081922297107},

But the aides persuaded him not to because of the voluminous reports of their strained relationship.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties remained largely silent about the White House churn, though Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who is retiring this year, called General McMaster \u201ca stabilizing force\u201d and expressed concern about his possible departure.\n\nMs. Sanders insisted that the recent personnel moves were normal for any White House.

The two did not speak.\n\nMr. Suh was one of two South Korean envoys who visited the White House last week to brief Mr. Trump on their meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang a few days earlier. But he was overshadowed by his colleague \u2014 Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser \u2014 after the president instructed Mr. Chung to announce the meeting to reporters gathered in the White House driveway.\n\nNow that Mr. Pompeo has been promoted, officials said, the use of the intelligence channel is mostly a convenience. But he still needs to be confirmed by the Senate, a process that could take several weeks. By continuing to work through the C.I.A. channel, he can be involved in the planning while he awaits his move to the State Department.\n\nSome officials expressed concern about the C.I.A.\u2019s taking the lead in orchestrating a leader-to-leader meeting \u2014 work that would normally be the province of the State Department.\n\nThe intelligence officials on the North Korean side, they said, are unsavory figures, not least Kim Yong-chol himself, who is accused of masterminding the torpedo attack that sank a South Korean Navy ship in 2010, killing 46 sailors, and a deadly artillery attack on a South Korean island.\n\nStill, some diplomats said they were not concerned about the C.I.A.\u2019s role, as long as the meeting did not get derailed. They pointed out that the State Department just lost its chief North Korea negotiator, Joseph Yun, who retired from the Foreign Service, in part because of his frustration with his agency\u2019s diminished role.\n\nThe National Security Council has assembled a working group, composed of officials from several agencies, to strategize ahead of the meeting.

That has led to a chaotic and anxious period as companies and countries try their best to meet unclear specifications, and the clock continues to tick toward tariffs that are expected to go into effect next Friday, wiping out valuable contracts and putting global supply chains at risk.\n\nRobert Lighthizer, the government\u2019s top trade negotiator, has been charged with helping decide which countries will be excluded, while Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has been tasked with a parallel process for exempting imports of certain products that are not widely available in the United States. The Commerce Department has developed its procedures for such exclusions, but it has not yet released them publicly. Those will be issued by Sunday, a spokesman said.\n\nThe European Union commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, speaking on Wednesday to the European Parliament, said she left a meeting with Mr. Lighthizer over the weekend in Brussels without \u201csufficient clarity\u201d about how countries would secure exclusions.\n\nIn the interim, trade lawyers and lobbyists in Washington have begun offering assistance in securing exemptions and exclusions for foreign countries, companies and their United States partners. Lobbyists said they intended to seek support from elected officials in pushing for exemptions, and some lawmakers have already weighed in.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, has already helped make the case for an exemption for a major pipeline project in her state, predicting that the tariffs could add $500 million to the cost of a $43 billion natural gas export terminal that her state is building with China.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute sent 12 top executives from energy companies including BP America, Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and Shell to lobby Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The assembled group explained that free trade has been a boon to the industry and stressed the importance of steel to its operations, according to a person briefed on the meeting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump in turn told the executives that his administration wanted to make sure that the tariffs did not hurt the industry, the person briefed on the meeting said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe trade group issued a statement on Thursday saying that its executives \u201chighlighted a host of the industry\u2019s priority issues, including the importance of trade policies that recognize the integrated nature of North American and global markets.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Hogan Lovells and Covington & Burling \u2014 firms that specialize in international trade law and lobbying \u2014 published memos heralding their ability to help clients obtain exemptions, and dropping hints as to how they might go about doing so.\n\nHogan Lovells noted that existing contracts for steel or aluminum imports could potentially receive \u201cgrandfather\u201d exemptions. One company whose costs could rise because of the tariffs, Kinder Morgan, a pipeline maker based in Houston, recently signed Hogan Lovells to lobby on the impact of the \u201cimposition of steel tariffs on pipeline construction,\u201d according to a congressional filing posted last week.\n\nCGCN Group, a lobbying firm, recommends that companies highlight the advantages of global trade to a public that has grown skeptical, according to polls.\n\n\u201cProponents of free trade need to tailor their arguments to those Americans who have watched factories close and wages stagnate,\u201d according to a memo that CGCN sent last week to clients and prospective clients. It suggested that companies seeking exemptions refrain from warning of tumbling stock prices or potential layoffs, and instead argue that \u201cthe more money companies spend on steel and aluminum, the less they have to hire workers or give them a raise.\u201d\n\nDaniel Porter, chief trade lawyer for the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said he was counseling his clients that the exemption process could look similar to previous tariff processes, which allowed companies to file for exemptions and then gave their American competitors a chance to object to any of those requests.\n\nWith the current steel and aluminum tariffs, however, there is likely to be one notable change: Only companies based in the United States will be allowed to file for exclusions. That means steel makers in Japan and Europe will need to get their American customers to come forward and file the request on their behalf.\n\nPhoto\n\nCompanies like California Steel Industries, which makes flat rolled steel, and the Union Pacific railroad said they depended on foreign steel and were bracing for higher prices if they could not secure exemptions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLance M. Fritz, the chief executive of Union Pacific, said the railroad\u2019s most heavily trafficked routes were made with steel from Nippon Steel of Japan, which is harder and more durable than products available in the United States. If Japan does not secure an exemption, Mr. Fritz said, Union Pacific planned to apply for a product exclusion.\n\nForeign metal makers are also worried that American mills will push aggressively against these exclusions, cutting off products that American companies buy.\n\n\u201cThere is that classic gray middle, where the customers say the U.S. mill can\u2019t do an adequate job, and the U.S. mill says, \u2018No, you\u2019re being too finicky,\u2019\u201d Mr. Porter said. \u201cEven with the back door, some very real American manufacturing entities are going to be hurt by this.\u201d\n\nThat fight is already on display, as American metal producers press the administration to avoid giving in to metal users, like food packagers and beer companies, who are agitating for exemptions.\n\nOn Tuesday, the presidents of four trade associations \u2014 the American Beverage Association, the Beer Institute, the Brewers Association and the Can Manufacturers Institute \u2014 sent a letter to Mr. Ross asking for more clarification on the timing and process for exemptions. They argued that a delay would undoubtedly increase costs for manufacturers and could lead to unintended consequences.\n\nA separate letter on Thursday from the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supported the tariffs, urged Mr. Ross and Mr. Lighthizer not to undermine them by issuing country exemptions and product exclusions that were too broad. The group said that new steel jobs in Granite City, Ill., and Lorain, Ohio, had already been announced in response to the tariffs and that overly broad exemptions could undermine that progress.\n\nPhoto\n\nForeign governments are also looking for ways to avoid being hit by the tariffs, including having top officials speak personally to Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEverybody is going to be calling in their chits and trying to make their points about why their exemptions make sense, but not everyone will be successful,\u201d said Danny E. Sebright, the president of the U.S.-U.A.E. Business Council, a nonprofit group that seeks to bolster trade between the United States and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is a top exporter of aluminum to the United States. Mr. Sebright said that he expected Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the effective ruler of the Emirates, to visit the United States in the coming weeks, and that aluminum would be a topic of conversation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to work with the Trump administration on this, there is not going to be retaliation,\u201d Mr. Sebright said.\n\nAustralia has trumpeted an apparent exemption from Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, which an Australian government official said on Monday was achieved as a result of \u201chigh level and sustained advocacy\u201d by some of its highest-ranking officials.

He said Mr. Trump had reached out to him by telephone last week, but the two never connected; he later told Mr. Parscale that if the president wanted him out, Mr. Trump should say so. So the president did, on Twitter.\n\nMr. Tarkanian, whose father, Jerry Tarkanian, was a legendary basketball coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said he \u201cdid not think it was the right decision,\u201d but he added: \u201cI grew up in an athletic family. When the coach tells you to do something, many times you don\u2019t agree with it, but it\u2019s your responsibility to do it.\u201d\n\nIt was a striking illustration of how much Mr. Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party: It is difficult to take on the party establishment when the face of the party is a president beloved by primary voters.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those moments where the president of the United States has correctly and fully utilized the influence he has as the titular head of the Republican Party,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. \u201cIt\u2019s the hand of Donald Trump, recognizing that we cannot afford to lose Senate seats because we are fighting with ourselves.\u201d\n\nBy ending their primaries against the two senators, Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian snuffed out what was left of Mr. Bannon\u2019s vision for remaking Congress with candidates in his populist mold. At one time, Mr. Bannon envisioned primaries in Mississippi, Nebraska, Arizona, Wyoming and Nevada.\n\nNow he has none.\n\nWith Mr. Bannon exiled by the president and Mr. Trump getting along with congressional leaders and taking counsel from largely mainstream Republicans in the post-Bannon White House, there is little political space for right-wing insurgents to oust incumbents.\n\nPerhaps no one is happier about that than Mr. McConnell, whom Mr. Bannon had once threatened to unseat. Chris Pack, the spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee that Mr. McConnell helped found to ensure the re-election of incumbents, was succinct on Friday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Tarkanian, party strategists said, has already caused lasting damage to Mr. Heller by forcing him into positions he will later regret in his campaign against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democrat whose seat Mr. Tarkanian is now seeking. (Mr. Tarkanian lost to Ms. Rosen by about one percentage point in 2016.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast year, for instance, Mr. Heller agonized for weeks over Republicans\u2019 drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act, before finally siding with party leadership and voting to undo President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Mr. Tarkanian pounced, accusing Mr. Heller of having \u201cno convictions.\u201d And Democrats are still reminding the senator of that vote.\n\n\u201cNevadans learned today what Senator Heller got for selling out their health care and putting himself and his party first,\u201d Lauren Passalacqua, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said on Friday, adding that \u201cno amount of Trump tweets\u201d could save him.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump is often described as the ultimate insurgent, he is driven far more by personal interaction and whether he feels respected than by any ideological impulses. Mr. Wicker and Mr. Heller have spent months courting the president and taking care to note, publicly and privately, that they are in his corner.\n\nTheir lobbying paid off. Mr. Trump reiterated his support for Mr. Wicker when Mr. McDaniel got in the race late last month, and on Friday the president showed Mr. Tarkanian to the door. Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian had little choice but to give up their primaries: They were trying to carry a sort of pre-Trump message that was focused on purifying the Senate of moderation, hoping to link the incumbents to a flaccid establishment embodied by Mr. McConnell.\n\nThis approach proved effective at times during the Obama years and was nearly enough to lift Mr. McDaniel in 2014, when he came close to unseating Mr. Cochran.\n\nBut while Mr. McConnell is deeply unpopular among rank-and-file conservatives, he is not the animating force in today\u2019s party \u2014 Mr. Trump is. While the challengers could easily persuade primary voters to oppose Mr. McConnell\u2019s preferred candidates, it is a far more difficult task to get them to oppose their president.\n\nThe one Republican senator who may have lost his seat in a primary this year was the one who has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics: Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is retiring. In that race, the establishment Republican, Representative Martha McSally, is facing a primary challenge from Joe Arpaio, the controversial former sheriff of Maricopa County, and Kelli Ward, an osteopathic physician and former state senator who drew backing from Mr. Bannon last fall.\n\nYet in another sign of how he is veering closer to the congressional leadership, Mr. Trump has not offered support to either of the hard-liners, something White House officials assured Ms. McSally he would not do before she agreed to enter the race.\n\nAnd more recently, in another sign of Mr. Bannon\u2019s diminished influence, Ms. Ward disavowed him. \u201cI am distancing myself from Steve Bannon,\u201d she told CNN in an interview in January, adding, \u201cI support the president.\u201d", "keywords": ["sign", "republican", "president", "mr", "senator", "nevada", "bannon", "fizzles", "heller", "revolt", "exit", "candidates", "trump", "party", "tarkanian", "senate"], "polarity": 0.147074373713718, "subjectivity": 0.4040131999148392},

But Mr. Trump continued to suggest other countries could also be the culprit.\n\n\u201cBy the way, I have to say, Obama was the president during all of this meddling, or whatever you want to call it, with Russians and others possibly,\u201d he said in a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News.\n\nDecember 2017: Conflicting signals on national security\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first national security strategy blueprint made repeated references to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and its \u201cinformation operations as part of its offensive cyberefforts to influence public opinion across the globe.\u201d\n\nYet in his speech announcing the strategy on Dec. 18, Mr. Trump made one fleeting mention of Russia: of how it and China \u201cseek to challenge American influence, values and wealth.\u201d He made no mention of Russian meddling and instead praised intelligence sharing between Russia and the United States in the face of terrorism threats.\n\nAugust 2017: Signing a sanctions bill reluctantly\n\nAfter Congress passed legislation in late July to impose sanctions on Russia and limit the president\u2019s authority to lift them, Mr. Trump signed the bill but criticized it as \u201cseriously flawed \u2014 particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch\u2019s authority to negotiate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump signed the legislation on Aug. 2. Several days earlier, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government had retaliated by seizing two American diplomatic compounds in Russia and telling the United States Embassy in Moscow to reduce its staff across the country. Mr. Trump did not respond, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to comment.\n\nHowever, the State Department described Moscow\u2019s move as \u201ca regrettable and uncalled-for act.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it,\u201d the department said in a statement.\n\nJuly 2017: Suggesting he found Mr. Putin\u2019s denial persuasive\n\nAfter Mr. Trump met with Mr. Putin during a Group of 20 summit meeting, he recounted the Russian leader\u2019s assurances that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cFirst question \u2014 first 20, 25 minutes \u2014 I said, \u2018Did you do it?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, I did not, absolutely not.\u2019 I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that was published on July 12. \u201cSomebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn\u2019t have found out about it.

In a statement about his briefing on the cyberattacks that day, Mr. Trump pointed to \u201cRussia, China, other countries.\u201d\n\nDays before his inauguration, at a Jan. 11 news conference where he was asked whether he believed Mr. Putin ordered the hacking of American political committees, Mr. Trump said that \u201cas far as hacking, I think it was Russia.\u201d\n\nHe then added, \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s dismissiveness of accusations of Russian interference predates his time in the White House.\n\nLate December 2016: Praising Putin in the wake of sanctions\n\nOn Dec. 29, President Barack Obama issued sanctions against Russia and ejected 35 suspected Russian intelligence operators from the United States as punishment for Moscow\u2019s attempts to influence the election. But in a move widely believed to be aimed at fostering good relations with the incoming Trump administration, Mr. Putin announced on Dec. 30 that he would not retaliate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump promptly praised Mr. Putin\u2019s decision.\n\nA day later, Mr. Trump said he still wasn\u2019t convinced that Russia had interfered in the election, telling reporters: \u201cAnd I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.\u201d\n\nEarly December 2016: Disparaging intelligence agencies after reports on Russian interference\n\nAfter reports in December by the The New York Times and The Washington Post that United States intelligence assessments had concluded that Russian election meddling sought to aid Mr. Trump, the president-elect disagreed.\n\nIn an unsigned statement responding to the news, the Trump transition team dismissed the assessment by comparing it to flawed intelligence reports in the lead-up to the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOctober 2016: Questioning intelligence consensus that Russia is to blame\n\nOn Oct. 7, the United States intelligence community released a joint public statement saying it was \u201cconfident that the Russian government\u201d had directed cyberattacks on American individuals and institutions, including political organizations such as the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThree days after that, during the second presidential debate, Mr. Trump again cast doubt that Russia was responsible \u2014 or even that there was a cyberattack in the first place.\n\n\u201cMaybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nSeptember 2016: Continuing to cast doubt on Russian meddling\n\nAs the official nominees of their parties, Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton began receiving intelligence reports in early August. On Sept. 22, top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees issued a statement saying that they had \u201cconcluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,\u201d based on briefings they had received.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFour days later, during the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the D.N.C.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O.K.?\u201d\n\nJune 2016: Rejecting the D.N.C. claim that Russian hackers penetrated its files\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and a cybersecurity firm said that Russian hackers had obtained a trove of internal campaign emails and political opposition research.\n\nIn response, Mr. Trump suggested that the D.N.C. fabricated the story or hacked itself: \u201cWe believe it was the D.N.C. that did the \u2018hacking\u2019 as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader,\u201d he said in a campaign statement on June 15.\n\nHe did not mention Russia.", "keywords": ["russian", "mr", "meddling", "administration", "trump", "split", "statement", "states", "intelligence", "hacking", "2016", "russia"], "polarity": 0.023875999156898035, "subjectivity": 0.3109968059406261},

Pete Hegseth, a co-host of \u201cFox & Friends Weekend,\u201d is on the short list to become secretary of veterans affairs. John R. Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador and a frequent Fox News commentator, is under consideration for national security adviser.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe moves are another sign that the dividing line between media and government has been all but erased under Mr. Trump, a former reality star who views himself as the casting agent in chief.\n\nTelevision figures have served as press aides in past administrations, tasked with handling their former colleagues in the media. But the selection of Mr. Kudlow crossed a threshold of sorts: the elevation of a television star to a position of real influence over policies affecting millions of Americans.\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that Mr. Trump, whose view of the world is indelibly shaped by what he sees on TV, would be a president eager to break the fourth wall.\n\nPeople close to him have said a major part of his deliberative process is how a decision will play on cable news. Where previous presidents courted news personalities, Mr. Trump consults them, seeking policy and strategic advice from Fox News hosts like Jeanine Pirro, who at one point was interviewed for the job of deputy attorney general, and Sean Hannity.\n\nAt least three Fox News hosts \u2014 Tucker Carlson, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Laura Ingraham \u2014 were approached about joining his communications team.

Mr. Hegseth, if hired for the veterans affairs job, would be in charge of reforming a bureaucracy that administers benefits to millions.\n\nMr. Kudlow, a zealous advocate of lowering taxes on the wealthy, will be expected to forge an economic policy that, until this week, he had the luxury of merely judging from the safe harbor of a television studio.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a hall-of-mirrors moment on Wednesday, Mr. Kudlow went on television to describe how Mr. Trump was impressed with how he appeared on television.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re on the air,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I\u2019m looking at a picture of you,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Very handsome,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kudlow said during a chummy interview with his soon-to-be-former CNBC colleagues. He let out a laugh: \u201cSo Trumpian!\u201d\n\nInstalling the TV crowd in this West Wing could play out in unpredictable ways.\n\nThe administration spurred an international incident last year after Sean Spicer, its press secretary at the time, repeated an unsupported accusation about a British spy agency\u2019s wiretapping of the Trump campaign.

Mr. Trump later defended Mr. Napolitano, saying, \u201cAll we did was quote a very talented legal mind.\u201d\n\nThen came the incident involving Omarosa Manigault Newman, who made a name for herself as the villain of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2004 and lasted a year in the administration as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison.\n\nAfter she left her position, the reality-show presidency collided with an actual reality show: Ms. Newman joined the cast of \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d and impugned the Trump administration as \u201cso bad.\u201d\n\nThe White House decided to respond \u2014 on live television. \u201cOmarosa was fired three times on \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 and this was the fourth time we let her go,\u201d a deputy press secretary, Raj Shah, said during a White House briefing.

But Mr. Kudlow is more familiar with television lights than the glare that comes with public service; his Washington experience is largely limited to a 1980s stint as a bureaucrat in Ronald Reagan\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nHis predecessors who led the National Economic Council include Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Gary D.

Mueller III, raising questions about whether he is laying the groundwork to try to fire him.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets alarmed some Republicans, who spoke out on Sunday morning talk shows.

That's why I agree with the many others who have called for the appointment of an additional special counsel who, unlike Mueller, has the authority to look into the potential abuses of the FISA system that allowed the Democrat-funded Steele dossier to serve as the basis for the initial F.B.I. investigation.\n\n\u201cThe addition of an outside special counsel will ensure our ability to have full faith in our investigations into the very serious threats Putin's rogue government poses to our elections and nation as a whole.\u201d\n\nHave not commented\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee\n\nSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader\n\nCongressional Intelligence Committees\n\nThe Times reached out to every Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not parties to this conflict,\u201d replied Gen. Joseph L.

That campaign has so far failed to do so, and has instead caused the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crisis, with the worst outbreak of cholera in contemporary history and widespread child malnutrition.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was a tacit acknowledgment of the weaknesses of the Saudi armed forces.\n\nHuman rights groups say that Saudi Arabia has failed to meet its promises. \u201cSaudi Arabia had made pledges to make its engagement in Yemen less deadly and destructive,\u201d said Scott Paul, a policy specialist on Yemen at Oxfam America. \u201cWe do see the stark evidence that the situation has continued to deteriorate \u2014 innocent civilians continue to be caught up and killed in this crisis.\u201d\n\nA report to the United Nations Security Council in January described coalition \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d as \u201clargely inadequate and ineffective,\u201d and said that \u201cthe use of precision-guided weapons is a strong indicator that the intended targets were those affected by the airstrikes.\u201d\n\nWith Saudi Arabia flying as many as 200 missions a day in Yemen, the kingdom is seeking to buy more of those precision-guided weapons. Thomas A. Kennedy, the chief executive of Raytheon, met with State Department officials this month to promote the proposed sale of munitions to Saudi Arabia and the Emirates.\n\n\u201cWe value our 50-year partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and look forward to continuing to help meet their security needs,\u201d said Michael F. Doble, a spokesman for Raytheon.\n\nThe purchase, said William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, would be \u201csubstantial by standards of U.S.-Saudi trade in munitions, certainly one of the largest if not the largest for systems of the kind it likely includes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2017, the United States sold roughly $610 million in weapons and munitions to Saudi Arabia and $48 million in firearms to the Emirates. Bigger equipment, however, such as missile defense systems, made up a large portion of the purchases for both countries over the past year.\n\nDuring his trip to Saudi Arabia last year, his first overseas visit as president, Mr. Trump offered the kingdom a $110 billion arms package. A portion of his pledge \u2014 roughly $23.7 billion \u2014 had already been authorized under the Obama administration.\n\nHuman rights groups have long tied American-made weapons to the conflict in Yemen. A May 2017 report from Human Rights Watch said that Raytheon-made munitions had been used in at least four Saudi-led coalition strikes on innocents.\n\nIn one such attack, 31 civilians were killed and another 42 were wounded, according to the report.

Minnesota Confronts a National Quandary                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/school-discipline-disparities-white-black-students.html", "text": "Then another group followed them to lobby for keeping the guidance.\n\nA retired Minnesota teacher set off a conservative media blitz by linking the Obama-era guidance to frustrations that teachers have with violent students, raising the issue high enough for the White House to latch on after the Parkland massacre. The coverage prompted Republicans to speculate about whether relaxed disciplinary policies had allowed the violent track record of Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the shooting, to evade law enforcement.\n\nDebbie York, the teacher who raised the issue in a Breitbart News article, was forced to retire after a first grader in her suburban Minnesota school pushed her, injuring her back and neck. The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident.\n\nThe story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers\u2019 authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms. Ms. York is advocating that the law go national, and that the Obama guidance be repealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about arming teachers with guns; it is about arming them with the freedom to talk about troubled kids whose behavior not only needs to be assessed, but when the behavior puts others at risk of serious harm, intervention other than therapy,\u201d Ms. York said.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been eyeing the guidance for reversal since she took office, will head a White House commission on school safety that has been specifically tasked with examining whether to repeal the discipline guidance.\n\nCivil rights groups and congressional Democrats are standing by the guidance and pointing to evidence that suspensions are helping to drive the achievement gap between white and minority students. Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators\u2019 perception of both.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pressure cooker,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the district\u2019s chief of schools. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across America.\u201d\n\nWhile critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.\n\nBernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["national", "guidance", "district", "punished", "quandary", "white", "districts", "confronts", "ms", "discipline", "school", "minnesota", "students", "black", "teachers"], "polarity": 0.034482293662621545, "subjectivity": 0.3891631183024627},

(He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)\n\nMost ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.\n\n\u201cI would have to see who\u2019s running,\u201d said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Ms. Newman is vying to unseat Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Chicago Democrat, in a primary there on Tuesday.\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi, 77, must contend with colleagues from her own generation who want their turn in charge, as well as younger Democrats who\u2019d prefer to clear out the party\u2019s entire septuagenarian leadership team: beyond Ms. Pelosi, the other two ranking House Democrats, Mr. Hoyer and James E. Clyburn, are 78 and 77.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet at a time when women are at the forefront of the opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 volunteering, donating and running for office in record numbers \u2014 the specter of Democrats taking back the House only to unceremoniously dump the most powerful woman in American politics strikes many in the party as outrageous.\n\nAnd Ms. Pelosi herself is plainly in this camp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a woman at the table,\u201d she said in the interview Friday before getting on a plane for Houston, where she was going to raise money for House Democrats at the annual rodeo there.\n\nPhoto\n\nDemonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.\n\n\u201cI am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.\n\n\u201cIf I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,\u201d she said.\n\nEven as energy on the left has soared across the country thanks to Mr. Trump, tensions among House Democrats are brewing inside the Capitol. Should Democrats fail to reclaim the House in a year with so many factors in their favor, Ms. Pelosi and her long-serving lieutenants will almost certainly be pushed to step down.\n\nYet some in the caucus want to see new leadership no matter what. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, hosted Mr. Crowley at a St. Patrick\u2019s Day-themed event last week and unexpectedly announced that he would back Mr. Crowley for leader. Mr. Pascrell, 81, said the culture of the House was changing.\n\n\u201cA lot of new people will be coming in and I think we should start fresh,\u201d Mr. Pascrell said, adding almost apologetically of Ms. Pelosi: \u201cShe\u2019s taken a lot of crap from Republicans and Democrats and she\u2019s really been above it all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said he had also encouraged Mr. Crowley to run for speaker.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHaving Joe be the leader of this party next session would be a welcome change,\u201d said Mr. Vela, 55, adding that Ms. Pelosi \u201churts our candidates\u201d in competitive districts.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Crowley has been inviting groups of younger lawmakers to meet for coffee and pastries in his office, reaching out to high-profile newer members like Joaquin Castro of Texas and Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Crowley declined to rule out taking on Ms. Pelosi. Asked if he was seeking commitments for a future race, Mr. Crowley said only that \u201cI have been talking to my colleagues about what they and we can do to help put us in the majority.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi dismissed the idea of a challenge from Mr. Crowley, who briefly considered challenging her after the 2016 election, and her aides pointedly noted that at an event in New York last week, he introduced her as \u201csoon to be speaker again.\u201d\n\nMr. Hoyer, in turn, has pitched himself to colleagues as a transitional House speaker, according to multiple lawmakers who have spoken with him \u2014 a steady hand through the 2020 elections, and perhaps no further. Katie Grant, his spokeswoman, said he was \u201cfocused on taking back the House.\u201d\n\nPart of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s challenge owes to the changing nature of fund-raising: Mr. Lamb raised over $4 million from mostly online contributors, the same way other Democrats are attracting donations. That has raised questions about just how much Ms. Pelosi\u2019s vaunted fund-raising prowess still matters.\n\n\u201cIt weakens the leverage of party leaders,\u201d Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who challenged Ms. Pelosi after the 2016 elections, said of the new fund-raising tools.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet some Democrats predicted that if the party rides an electoral wave back to power, Ms. Pelosi would reap much of the credit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf we take the majority, I completely assume that Leader Pelosi will be Speaker Pelosi,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California.\n\nThe most plausible scenario for Ms. Pelosi to exit, Democrats believe, is one in which the party just barely wins control of the House. A number of new lawmakers would have pledged not to vote for her, and several Democrats oppose her as a matter of routine, potentially denying her the 218 votes needed to secure the speakership.\n\n\u201cI think it will be left up to the new membership,\u201d said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, noting that freshman lawmakers and the rest of the caucus should \u201cwork their will.\u201d That could doom Ms. Pelosi, especially if more Democrats follow Mr. Lamb\u2019s approach.\n\nAt least three of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cred to blue\u201d candidates \u2014 recruits designated as top priorities by the D.C.C.C. \u2014 have signaled they would prefer a leader other than Ms. Pelosi. In Minnesota, Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman challenging Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, has called for a \u201cnew generation of leadership.\u201d In Washington State, Lisa Brown, a former state senator who is challenging Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the Republican leadership, said \u201cthere\u2019s room for new blood in all the caucuses in Congress.\u201d\n\nAnd Paul Davis, who is running for an open seat in Kansas, is flatly opposed to Ms. Pelosi. He said a change was \u201cbadly needed\u201d and lamented leaders who are \u201ctoxic in this part of the country.\u201d\n\nBut there is unease with Ms. Pelosi in solid-blue districts, too. In two Boston-area districts, neither the Democratic incumbents nor their more progressive rivals have committed to backing Ms. Pelosi. Brianna Wu, a liberal activist opposing Representative Stephen F. Lynch in a Democratic primary, said she was worried Democrats would suffer from Ms. Pelosi\u2019s \u201cinability to express a vision for the party.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a moderate Democrat, said he had encouraged other congressional hopefuls to oppose Ms. Pelosi if necessary.\n\n\u201cI have liberals back home, the one thing they really like about me is the fact that I voted against Nancy,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what candidate you are, it\u2019s not necessarily a bad message.\u201d", "keywords": ["democrats", "mr", "representative", "crowley", "democrat", "democratic", "lead", "pelosi", "candidates", "sure", "house", "ms", "speaker", "wants", "arent", "nancy"], "polarity": 0.10015747537486669, "subjectivity": 0.39682351464960147},

(The other was $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.)\n\nThe Palm Beach deal was unusual for several reasons.\n\nMr. Trump sold the house less than four years after buying it for about $41 million. Mr. Rybolovlev paid the markup despite buying the property in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis. And Mr. Trump had made few improvements to the mansion, which reportedly had a mold problem.\n\nMr. Rybolovlev, moreover, never lived in the property.\n\nAt the time of the sale, Mr. Trump was facing financial pressure.

The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev disputed that he overpaid for the property, saying that the sale was negotiated down from an asking price of $125 million and that it predated an upheaval in the Palm Beach real estate market.

In a White House where one aide described the existence of \u201calternative facts\u201d and another acknowledged telling \u201cwhite lies,\u201d staff members scramble to defend his claims without putting their own credibility on the line. News organizations debate when to use the word \u201clie\u201d because it implies intent.\n\nSince Mr. Trump became a presidential candidate, PolitiFact has evaluated more than 500 assertions and found 69 percent of them mostly false, false or \u201cpants on fire\u201d false. By comparison, it judged 26 percent of the statements by Mr. Obama that it evaluated as false and the same percentage for those by Hillary Clinton.\n\nThese are not scientific measurements, of course, because the selection of statements for examination is inherently subjective and focused on those that seem questionable, rather than a gauge of all public comments. Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders say fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact are politically biased, which Mr. Adair and his counterparts adamantly deny. But even among Republicans examined by PolitiFact, Mr. Trump is an outlier.\n\nWhile PolitiFact did not exist during most of President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure, it has found that 42 percent of statements that it examined by Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, the two previous Republican presidential nominees, were false. The party\u2019s congressional leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, judged on far fewer statements, were both at similar levels, 43 percent and 41 percent.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters rarely defend him as a truth teller, but argue that all presidents lie and point to false statements made by his predecessors, like Bill Clinton (Monica Lewinsky), Mr. Bush (Iraq) and Mr. Obama (health care).\n\nAdvisers say privately that Mr. Trump may not always be precise but is speaking a larger truth that many Americans understand. Flyspecking, tut-tutting critics in the news media, they say, fail to grasp the connection he has with a section of the country that feels profoundly misled by a self-serving establishment. To them, the particular facts do not matter as much as this deeper truth.\n\n\u201cI think presidents, all of them, actually have a habit of thinking that they\u2019re right, whether they\u2019re right or not,\u201d said Patrick H. Caddell, a political consultant who shared research with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s more guilty of that than some sort of preplanned and mendacious statements.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Caddell, a strategist for Jimmy Carter when he was beaten up by the media as na\u00efve for promising never to tell a lie, said Americans see Mr. Trump in context. \u201cIn Washington, D.C., facts don\u2019t matter; people have narratives, including the media, and they just ignore anything that doesn\u2019t fit that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should the American people punish him when they think the entire political culture\u201d is that way?\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s reported conversation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada occurred during a St. Louis fund-raiser on Wednesday for Josh Hawley, a Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. Reporters were not permitted in the room, but an audio recording was later obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nAs Mr. Trump told the story, the Canadian leader assured him that the United States did not have a trade deficit with Canada.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript published by The Post. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know. Josh, I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She later said on Twitter that the president was referring only to trade in goods, not trade in both goods and services, the common measurement.\n\nBut the point was that Mr. Trump acknowledged to the donors that he made the claim having no idea whether it was right or wrong. And it was not even the only time that day he made false statements.\n\nIn a public conversation at a Boeing factory in St. Louis, he lauded the number of jobs created on his watch and said \u201cnobody would have believed that could have happened.\u201d But in fact, 2.5 million new jobs were created in his first 13 months as president, almost exactly the same as the 2.6 million created in the 13 months before he became president and Mr. Obama was in the White House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a businessman, Mr. Trump often fabricated or exaggerated to sell a narrative or advance his interests. In his memoir, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d he called it \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d or \u201cinnocent exaggeration.\u201d\n\nWhen trying to lure investors to a casino project, he had bulldozers dig on one side of the site and dump the dirt on the other to give the impression that the project was making progress. He would call reporters and pretend to be a publicity agent for himself named John Barron or John Miller. He claimed to earn $1 million from a speech when it was $400,000. He claimed to be worth $3.5 billion when seeking a bank loan, four times what the bank eventually found.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a salesman and that\u2019s not about telling the truth, that\u2019s not the DNA about being a salesman,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, the author of \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President,\u201d a biography of his family. \u201cThe DNA of being a salesman is telling people what they want to hear. And he\u2019s got it.\u201d\n\nJack O\u2019Donnell, who was president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, recalled Mr. Trump telling New Jersey authorities that he had secured bank financing for a new casino and would not use junk bonds, only to turn around and then use junk bonds.\n\n\u201cIn my experience with him, there are times when he just compulsively lies and there are times when he strategically lies,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell, who wrote a scathing book about Mr. Trump. \u201cIn both regards, after he says something, I do think he believes that whatever he says becomes his reality. That\u2019s my experience with him. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big but it certainly can be.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump continued his practice as president. The Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker documented 2,140 false or misleading claims in Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office, a rate of nearly six a day, many of them repeated even after he was corrected.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll in January showed that only 35 percent of Americans consider him honest, while 60 percent do not. In their first terms, more than 50 percent considered Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama honest, although those numbers fell for both by their second terms.\n\nRepublicans as well as Democrats express concern. Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, has a new book coming out in May called \u201cGaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us.\u201d On the cover is an illustration of Mr. Trump with a Pinocchio nose.\n\nHer explanation is that Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters do not see deception, they see a commitment to winning. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s lies and fabrications don\u2019t horrify America,\u201d says the publisher\u2019s summary of her book. \u201cThey enthrall us.\u201d", "keywords": ["president", "mr", "lies", "trumps", "statements", "credibility", "white", "wrong", "trump", "false", "trade", "tests", "truth"], "polarity": 0.044688273036487314, "subjectivity": 0.4499777752009896},

Such a move could set off alarms among Republicans in Congress, who have largely stood by as the president repeatedly assailed the Justice Department and the F.B.I.\n\nMr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking on behalf of the president but later backed off that assertion. He did not elaborate on why he was calling for the end of the investigation, saying only: \u201cJust end it on the merits in light of recent revelations.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the president were skeptical that Mr. Dowd was acting on his own. Mr. Trump has a history of using advisers to publicly test a message, giving him some distance from it. And Mr. Dowd\u2019s comments came at a time when members of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team are jockeying to stay in his favor.\n\nHours later, the president echoed Mr. Dowd\u2019s accusations of corruption in the theoretical \u201cdeep state\u201d that Mr. Trump has long cast as a boogeyman working to undermine him.\n\n\u201cThere was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets, posted on a Saturday in which he remained inside the White House with no public schedule, came as Mr. Mueller is said to have sent questions to Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team as part of negotiations over an interview with the president. Mr. Mueller is seeking the interview, according to two people close to the White House, in order to ask follow-up questions, but put forward the list as a start.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Dowd\u2019s remarks about Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation represented an extraordinary shift in public strategy for the Trump legal team. Since taking over the case last summer, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have urged a strategy of restraint, in which the president avoids discussing Mr. Mueller or criticizing him, and the lawyers had done nothing publicly until now that could agitate the special counsel\u2019s team.\n\nThe comments by both Mr. Trump and Mr. Dowd lent credence to Mr. McCabe\u2019s assertion that the president sees his firing as directly tied into Mr. Mueller\u2019s case. Mr. McCabe, who is a potential witness in the investigation, declared that his dismissal was an attempt to undermine it.\n\nMr. Sessions fired Mr. McCabe for failing to be forthcoming with the department\u2019s internal watchdog about a conversation he authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist.\n\nLike Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe also kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president and his conversations with Mr. Comey, a person close to Mr. McCabe said on Saturday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump also asked him to end an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The special counsel is investigating both matters.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s memos were left at the F.B.I., which means that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s account.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers had no comment on Saturday, and Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly defended the special counsel, including in an interview this month with USA Today, in which he said he had seen no need to fire Mr. Mueller.\n\nMr. Comey, who has a book scheduled to be published next month, weighed in himself.\n\n\u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnd they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters have tried to undercut the investigation as part of a broader attempt to clear him of wrongdoing. This month, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 which is led by a close ally of the president, Representative Devin Nunes of California \u2014 concluded their own investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling, saying they had determined the president did nothing wrong. Democrats on the panel accused Republicans of putting partisan politics ahead of fact finding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee tied to Terry McAuliffe, a Hillary Clinton ally, for a Virginia State Senate race, praised Mr. McCabe\u2019s ouster again on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife\u2019s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation?\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHow many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration as the special counsel investigation has shown more signs of accelerating rather than ending. His legal team has worked to keep him from firing Mr. Mueller in the past. To keep the president at bay, the lawyers \u2014 led by the White House lawyer Ty Cobb \u2014 told him that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation would be over by last December and that they would ask Mr. Mueller to put out a statement saying the president was not a target of the investigation.\n\nBut instead, Mr. Trump was livid anew this week over the Times report that Mr. Mueller had subpoenaed his corporate records, including those related to Russia, according to one person close to the White House.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers appear to be feeling increasingly uneasy about where they stand. This month, Mr. Trump met with a veteran Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, to discuss coming on board to take over the president\u2019s dealings with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office and possibly replacing Donald F. McGahn II as White House counsel. The president\u2019s personal lawyers, Mr. Dowd and Jay Sekulow, did not know about the meeting, prompting concerns that they could be pushed aside, and potentially making them less resistant to Mr. Trump\u2019s whims about handling the inquiry.\n\nLast June, Mr. Trump backed down from his demand that Mr. Mueller be fired after Mr. McGahn threatened to quit. A month later, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family\u2019s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. After the Trump Organization subpoena was revealed on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers privately tried to play it down, in part to keep the president and his family calm.\n\nMr. Dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing episodes in recent months. In December, he said he had written a tweet posted by the president that implied Mr. Trump knew that Mr. Flynn had lied to the F.B.I. when Mr. Trump fired him.\n\nMonths earlier, Mr. Dowd was overheard by a Times reporter discussing details of a dispute inside the president\u2019s legal team over lunch at a Washington steakhouse.\n\nDemocrats seized on Mr. Dowd\u2019s statement on Saturday. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called on lawmakers of both parties to defend Mr. Mueller.", "keywords": ["president", "mr", "mueller", "investigation", "dowd", "presidents", "special", "trump", "ended", "counsel", "lawyers", "lawyer", "inquiry"], "polarity": 0.08877417838091993, "subjectivity": 0.35223340953678034},
{"title": "\n                    Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s Rule-Cutting E.P.A. Chief, Plots His Political Future                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/climate/scott-pruitt-political-ambitions.html", "text": "Mr. Pruitt has faced criticism, and received a reprimand from his boss, for spending more than $107,000 of public money on first-class air travel. But he remains a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s, and after the past week of White House turmoil \u2014 with the president dismissing his secretary of state and intimating that a greater shake-up may follow \u2014 Mr. Pruitt appears to have job security that could work to his advantage over time.\n\nThe endgame, say people who have spoken with Mr. Pruitt, is a possible run at the presidency in 2024 or later. \u201cIt was always known among elite Republicans that this guy had higher ambitions,\u201d said Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. \u201cThe question was just, \u2018Does he want to be president, or does he want to be attorney general?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo jump from E.P.A. chief to any of those posts would be highly unusual for the head of a historically wonky, low-profile agency. \u201cThe take has always been that E.P.A. is where your political career goes to die,\u201d said William K. Reilly, who headed the agency under President George Bush.\n\nEven in Republican administrations, Mr. Reilly said, the job historically involved imposing regulations on polluting industries, which can create powerful enemies. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of job that if you do it right, you antagonize a lot of people \u2014 big industry, even your own president,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Pruitt has flipped the script. As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. 14 times, and he has spent the past year working to undo regulations that would have required farmers to restrict their fertilizer use; oil and gas firms to control global warming pollution from their wells; and Midwestern power plants to burn less coal.\n\n\u201cHe has made a big splash,\u201d Mr. Reilly said. \u201cThe mission he is on is not one that his predecessors at E.P.A. have recognized. And it could be a good strategy to win the constituency that elected the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s precise political path forward is not certain. He is viewed as a likely candidate to run for a Senate seat in Oklahoma in 2020 if the incumbent, James Inhofe, retires. But it remains unclear if Mr. Inhofe, 83, will do so, and his office declined to comment. There is also speculation that Mr. Pruitt might jump in as a last-minute candidate in this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen asked about its boss\u2019s ambitions, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s staff emphasizes that he is focused only on the job at hand. It also notes that the E.P.A. chief has made a significant effort to promote his work. \u201cAdministrator Pruitt has utilized a wide array of news outlets to advance President Trump\u2019s agenda on regulatory certainty and environmental stewardship,\u201d his spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, wrote in an email. Through Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Pruitt declined an interview request.\n\nSome former E.P.A. chiefs noted that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s unusual speed at attempting to dismantle regulations could mean that those efforts might not stand up to later legal challenges. \u201cThe policies he\u2019s pushing play very well in his home state and with the base \u2014 but you can\u2019t do them overnight,\u201d said Christine Todd Whitman, who headed the E.P.A. in the George W. Bush administration and before that was the governor of New Jersey. \u201cThey\u2019re getting rushed out. I don\u2019t think the homework is being done. It makes for good sound bites, but they might not stand up legally.\u201d\n\nThat might not affect Mr. Pruitt\u2019s longer-term political aspirations, though. \u201cPruitt could be gone from E.P.A. by the time that happens,\u201d Ms. Whitman said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The rule has been particularly unpopular with the rural voters who make up the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s base. This year, Mr. Pruitt announced he would freeze implementation of the rule and issue a more farmer-friendly version by the spring.\n\nLast year, Mr. Pruitt made two trips to Iowa, a key campaign state in presidential elections, to talk about his agenda. In the summer, he met with farmers to tout his rollback of the clean water regulation. In December, he promised that the E.P.A. would not use regulations to curb the production of corn ethanol \u2014 an issue considered key for presidential candidates in Iowa.\n\nMr. Pruitt has also halted implementation of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules, which would have frozen construction of new coal-fired power plants, and has said he intends to propose a replacement rule this year. Last April, he spoke at a Pennsylvania coal mine, telling workers that \u201cthe regulatory assault is over.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Mr. Pruitt has spent time with major political donors. Last year he met with Foster Friess, a Republican fund-raiser, and with investors connected to Sheldon Adelson, the party megadonor, according to meeting records obtained by The New York Times. He also met with Steven Chancellor, an Indiana coal executive and Republican fund-raiser, according to documents obtained by the Sierra Club and published by Politico.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAll of this is unusual,\u201d Ms. Whitman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a federal position, you should not appear to be campaigning.\u201d\n\nWere Mr. Inhofe, long known as Congress\u2019s most vocal opponent of efforts to fight global warming, to retire, Mr. Pruitt would be a natural fit to try to win his Senate seat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pruitt, who keeps his watch set to the time in Oklahoma even when he is working on the East Coast, has traveled to his home state regularly. Last March through May he spent 43 out of 92 days in Oklahoma or traveling to or from the state, according to a report by the Environmental Integrity Project.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s rise to prominence in Oklahoma began during the eight years he managed and co-owned the Oklahoma City RedHawks, a minor league baseball team. He won a seat in the State Legislature and opened a small legal office, Christian Legal Services, to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights.\n\nAs an owner of the RedHawks, Mr. Pruitt ran television ads that featured himself promoting the team. They gave him statewide recognition and played a role in his 2010 race for attorney general, said Chris Wilson, an Oklahoma-based Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cHe had instant name recognition,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.\n\nAs attorney general, Mr. Pruitt built close ties with the state\u2019s oil and natural gas industry. A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send to the E.P.A., on state stationery, outlining the economic hardship of environmental regulations on their industries.\n\nThe ties have paid off politically. Harold G. Hamm, who advised the presidential campaigns of Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney and is the chief executive of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, was a co-chairman of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s 2013 re-election campaign.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s tenure at the E.P.A. has already proven popular with the oil and natural gas industry. His proposals have been aimed at loosening regulations, particularly an Obama-era rule that would have required companies to rein in emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from new oil and gas wells. (A federal appeals court later ruled that the effort was illegal.)\n\nEnergy companies were also delighted when Mr. Pruitt flew to Morocco in December, in an unusual trip aimed at promoting exports of natural gas. That trip received criticism, though, in part because the E.P.A. does not oversee natural gas exports.\n\nThe E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general is investigating some of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s trips, including the one to Morocco and some to Oklahoma, but it is not clear whether that will be a liability. \u201cIt\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s not fatal,\u201d Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised the Trump campaign, said referring to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s airline expenses. \u201cNone of the old rules seem to apply,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current president seems to have erased a lot of them.\u201d", "keywords": ["future", "pruitt", "president", "mr", "oklahoma", "trumps", "gas", "rule", "political", "scott", "regulations", "plots", "state", "epa", "chief", "pruitts", "rulecutting"], "polarity": 0.10251257751257753, "subjectivity": 0.42126135876135873},

Mr. McCabe, who stepped down in January and took a leave of absence, denied the accusation and appealed this week to senior career officials in the Justice Department.\n\nLack of candor is a fireable offense at the F.B.I., but Mr. McCabe\u2019s last-minute dismissal was carried out against a highly politicized backdrop.\n\nMr. McCabe was among the first at the F.B.I. to scrutinize possible Trump campaign ties to Russia.

Mr. Trump has taunted Mr. McCabe both publicly and privately, and Republican allies have cast him as the center of a \u201cdeep state\u201d effort to undermine the Trump presidency.\n\nAs a witness, Mr. McCabe would be in a position to corroborate the testimony of the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who kept contemporaneous notes on his conversations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump prodded him to publicly exonerate the president on the question of Russian collusion and encouraged him to shut down an investigation into his national security adviser.\n\nIn a statement released by his lawyers, Mr. McCabe said his firing was part of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201congoing war on the F.B.I.\u201d and Robert S.

He said the president\u2019s public attacks were aimed at several targets. \u201cThe real damage is being done to the F.B.I., law enforcement and the special counsel,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McCabe was the F.B.I.\u2019s second in command during one of the most tumultuous periods in the bureau\u2019s history. He oversaw investigations into both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server \u2014 and he dealt with the fallout from both. He became the acting F.B.I. director after the sudden firing of his boss, Mr. Comey, and he publicly contradicted the White House on national television over whether Mr. Comey had lost the support of rank-and-file F.B.I. agents.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly singled him out for public attack, suggesting that he helped protect Mrs. Clinton from prosecution during the 2016 presidential campaign. As evidence, he pointed to the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nAs recently as Thursday, even as the White House said it left Mr. McCabe\u2019s fate in Mr. Sessions\u2019s hands, officials there left little doubt where the president stood. \u201cIt is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyer called those comments \u201cvile and defamatory\u201d and said they were intended to put pressure on the Justice Department. \u201cThis intervention by the White House in the D.O.J. disciplinary process is unprecedented, deeply unfair and dangerous,\u201d said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost her race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mrs. McCabe\u2019s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.\n\nThe president is not involved in the firing decisions of career employees like Mr. McCabe. His firing had been recommended by veteran disciplinary officials. But Mr. Trump\u2019s statements loom large over the decision, which is why previous presidents have typically refrained from wading into law enforcement and personnel matters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report faults Mr. McCabe for his lack of candor in interviews with internal investigators. The report has not been released, but people briefed on it say the allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which reported in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family\u2019s foundation.\n\nMr. McCabe, working through the F.B.I. press office, authorized a spokesman and a bureau lawyer to speak with The Journal in order to rebut allegations that Mr. McCabe had slowed down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the article ultimately noted, Mr. McCabe had insisted that his agents had the authority to investigate the foundation, even if the Justice Department refused to authorize grand jury subpoenas.\n\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Mr. Comey groomed him for senior leadership from a young age, rankling some agents who saw him as too academic and not enough of a traditional crime-fighter. But senior F.B.I. officials and his counterparts in other agencies praised his intellect and ability to manage complicated worldwide national security issues.", "keywords": ["scorn", "mr", "fbi", "andrew", "trumps", "justice", "investigation", "comey", "fired", "mccabes", "trump", "questions", "firing", "candor", "mccabe", "target", "officials"], "polarity": 0.034621623102635765, "subjectivity": 0.36245081922297107},

But the aides persuaded him not to because of the voluminous reports of their strained relationship.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties remained largely silent about the White House churn, though Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who is retiring this year, called General McMaster \u201ca stabilizing force\u201d and expressed concern about his possible departure.\n\nMs. Sanders insisted that the recent personnel moves were normal for any White House.

But he still needs to be confirmed by the Senate, a process that could take several weeks. By continuing to work through the C.I.A. channel, he can be involved in the planning while he awaits his move to the State Department.\n\nSome officials expressed concern about the C.I.A.\u2019s taking the lead in orchestrating a leader-to-leader meeting \u2014 work that would normally be the province of the State Department.\n\nThe intelligence officials on the North Korean side, they said, are unsavory figures, not least Kim Yong-chol himself, who is accused of masterminding the torpedo attack that sank a South Korean Navy ship in 2010, killing 46 sailors, and a deadly artillery attack on a South Korean island.\n\nStill, some diplomats said they were not concerned about the C.I.A.\u2019s role, as long as the meeting did not get derailed. They pointed out that the State Department just lost its chief North Korea negotiator, Joseph Yun, who retired from the Foreign Service, in part because of his frustration with his agency\u2019s diminished role.\n\nThe National Security Council has assembled a working group, composed of officials from several agencies, to strategize ahead of the meeting.

That has led to a chaotic and anxious period as companies and countries try their best to meet unclear specifications, and the clock continues to tick toward tariffs that are expected to go into effect next Friday, wiping out valuable contracts and putting global supply chains at risk.\n\nRobert Lighthizer, the government\u2019s top trade negotiator, has been charged with helping decide which countries will be excluded, while Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has been tasked with a parallel process for exempting imports of certain products that are not widely available in the United States. The Commerce Department has developed its procedures for such exclusions, but it has not yet released them publicly. Those will be issued by Sunday, a spokesman said.\n\nThe European Union commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, speaking on Wednesday to the European Parliament, said she left a meeting with Mr. Lighthizer over the weekend in Brussels without \u201csufficient clarity\u201d about how countries would secure exclusions.\n\nIn the interim, trade lawyers and lobbyists in Washington have begun offering assistance in securing exemptions and exclusions for foreign countries, companies and their United States partners. Lobbyists said they intended to seek support from elected officials in pushing for exemptions, and some lawmakers have already weighed in.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, has already helped make the case for an exemption for a major pipeline project in her state, predicting that the tariffs could add $500 million to the cost of a $43 billion natural gas export terminal that her state is building with China.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute sent 12 top executives from energy companies including BP America, Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and Shell to lobby Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The assembled group explained that free trade has been a boon to the industry and stressed the importance of steel to its operations, according to a person briefed on the meeting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump in turn told the executives that his administration wanted to make sure that the tariffs did not hurt the industry, the person briefed on the meeting said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe trade group issued a statement on Thursday saying that its executives \u201chighlighted a host of the industry\u2019s priority issues, including the importance of trade policies that recognize the integrated nature of North American and global markets.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Hogan Lovells and Covington & Burling \u2014 firms that specialize in international trade law and lobbying \u2014 published memos heralding their ability to help clients obtain exemptions, and dropping hints as to how they might go about doing so.\n\nHogan Lovells noted that existing contracts for steel or aluminum imports could potentially receive \u201cgrandfather\u201d exemptions. One company whose costs could rise because of the tariffs, Kinder Morgan, a pipeline maker based in Houston, recently signed Hogan Lovells to lobby on the impact of the \u201cimposition of steel tariffs on pipeline construction,\u201d according to a congressional filing posted last week.\n\nCGCN Group, a lobbying firm, recommends that companies highlight the advantages of global trade to a public that has grown skeptical, according to polls.\n\n\u201cProponents of free trade need to tailor their arguments to those Americans who have watched factories close and wages stagnate,\u201d according to a memo that CGCN sent last week to clients and prospective clients. It suggested that companies seeking exemptions refrain from warning of tumbling stock prices or potential layoffs, and instead argue that \u201cthe more money companies spend on steel and aluminum, the less they have to hire workers or give them a raise.\u201d\n\nDaniel Porter, chief trade lawyer for the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said he was counseling his clients that the exemption process could look similar to previous tariff processes, which allowed companies to file for exemptions and then gave their American competitors a chance to object to any of those requests.\n\nWith the current steel and aluminum tariffs, however, there is likely to be one notable change: Only companies based in the United States will be allowed to file for exclusions. That means steel makers in Japan and Europe will need to get their American customers to come forward and file the request on their behalf.\n\nPhoto\n\nCompanies like California Steel Industries, which makes flat rolled steel, and the Union Pacific railroad said they depended on foreign steel and were bracing for higher prices if they could not secure exemptions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLance M. Fritz, the chief executive of Union Pacific, said the railroad\u2019s most heavily trafficked routes were made with steel from Nippon Steel of Japan, which is harder and more durable than products available in the United States. If Japan does not secure an exemption, Mr. Fritz said, Union Pacific planned to apply for a product exclusion.\n\nForeign metal makers are also worried that American mills will push aggressively against these exclusions, cutting off products that American companies buy.\n\n\u201cThere is that classic gray middle, where the customers say the U.S. mill can\u2019t do an adequate job, and the U.S. mill says, \u2018No, you\u2019re being too finicky,\u2019\u201d Mr. Porter said. \u201cEven with the back door, some very real American manufacturing entities are going to be hurt by this.\u201d\n\nThat fight is already on display, as American metal producers press the administration to avoid giving in to metal users, like food packagers and beer companies, who are agitating for exemptions.\n\nOn Tuesday, the presidents of four trade associations \u2014 the American Beverage Association, the Beer Institute, the Brewers Association and the Can Manufacturers Institute \u2014 sent a letter to Mr. Ross asking for more clarification on the timing and process for exemptions. They argued that a delay would undoubtedly increase costs for manufacturers and could lead to unintended consequences.\n\nA separate letter on Thursday from the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supported the tariffs, urged Mr. Ross and Mr. Lighthizer not to undermine them by issuing country exemptions and product exclusions that were too broad. The group said that new steel jobs in Granite City, Ill., and Lorain, Ohio, had already been announced in response to the tariffs and that overly broad exemptions could undermine that progress.\n\nPhoto\n\nForeign governments are also looking for ways to avoid being hit by the tariffs, including having top officials speak personally to Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEverybody is going to be calling in their chits and trying to make their points about why their exemptions make sense, but not everyone will be successful,\u201d said Danny E. Sebright, the president of the U.S.-U.A.E. Business Council, a nonprofit group that seeks to bolster trade between the United States and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is a top exporter of aluminum to the United States. Mr. Sebright said that he expected Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the effective ruler of the Emirates, to visit the United States in the coming weeks, and that aluminum would be a topic of conversation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to work with the Trump administration on this, there is not going to be retaliation,\u201d Mr. Sebright said.\n\nAustralia has trumpeted an apparent exemption from Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, which an Australian government official said on Monday was achieved as a result of \u201chigh level and sustained advocacy\u201d by some of its highest-ranking officials.

He said Mr. Trump had reached out to him by telephone last week, but the two never connected; he later told Mr. Parscale that if the president wanted him out, Mr. Trump should say so. So the president did, on Twitter.\n\nMr. Tarkanian, whose father, Jerry Tarkanian, was a legendary basketball coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said he \u201cdid not think it was the right decision,\u201d but he added: \u201cI grew up in an athletic family. When the coach tells you to do something, many times you don\u2019t agree with it, but it\u2019s your responsibility to do it.\u201d\n\nIt was a striking illustration of how much Mr. Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party: It is difficult to take on the party establishment when the face of the party is a president beloved by primary voters.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those moments where the president of the United States has correctly and fully utilized the influence he has as the titular head of the Republican Party,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. \u201cIt\u2019s the hand of Donald Trump, recognizing that we cannot afford to lose Senate seats because we are fighting with ourselves.\u201d\n\nBy ending their primaries against the two senators, Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian snuffed out what was left of Mr. Bannon\u2019s vision for remaking Congress with candidates in his populist mold.

Chris Pack, the spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee that Mr. McConnell helped found to ensure the re-election of incumbents, was succinct on Friday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Tarkanian pounced, accusing Mr. Heller of having \u201cno convictions.\u201d And Democrats are still reminding the senator of that vote.\n\n\u201cNevadans learned today what Senator Heller got for selling out their health care and putting himself and his party first,\u201d Lauren Passalacqua, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said on Friday, adding that \u201cno amount of Trump tweets\u201d could save him.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump is often described as the ultimate insurgent, he is driven far more by personal interaction and whether he feels respected than by any ideological impulses. Mr. Wicker and Mr. Heller have spent months courting the president and taking care to note, publicly and privately, that they are in his corner.\n\nTheir lobbying paid off. Mr. Trump reiterated his support for Mr. Wicker when Mr. McDaniel got in the race late last month, and on Friday the president showed Mr. Tarkanian to the door. Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian had little choice but to give up their primaries: They were trying to carry a sort of pre-Trump message that was focused on purifying the Senate of moderation, hoping to link the incumbents to a flaccid establishment embodied by Mr. McConnell.\n\nThis approach proved effective at times during the Obama years and was nearly enough to lift Mr. McDaniel in 2014, when he came close to unseating Mr. Cochran.\n\nBut while Mr. McConnell is deeply unpopular among rank-and-file conservatives, he is not the animating force in today\u2019s party \u2014 Mr. Trump is. While the challengers could easily persuade primary voters to oppose Mr. McConnell\u2019s preferred candidates, it is a far more difficult task to get them to oppose their president.\n\nThe one Republican senator who may have lost his seat in a primary this year was the one who has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics: Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is retiring. In that race, the establishment Republican, Representative Martha McSally, is facing a primary challenge from Joe Arpaio, the controversial former sheriff of Maricopa County, and Kelli Ward, an osteopathic physician and former state senator who drew backing from Mr. Bannon last fall.\n\nYet in another sign of how he is veering closer to the congressional leadership, Mr. Trump has not offered support to either of the hard-liners, something White House officials assured Ms. McSally he would not do before she agreed to enter the race.\n\nAnd more recently, in another sign of Mr. Bannon\u2019s diminished influence, Ms. Ward disavowed him. \u201cI am distancing myself from Steve Bannon,\u201d she told CNN in an interview in January, adding, \u201cI support the president.\u201d", "keywords": ["sign", "republican", "president", "mr", "senator", "nevada", "bannon", "fizzles", "heller", "revolt", "exit", "candidates", "trump", "party", "tarkanian", "senate"], "polarity": 0.147074373713718, "subjectivity": 0.4040131999148392},

Here is a look back at how the president and his own administration have parted ways on Russia.\n\nFebruary 2018: Deflecting accusations of Russian meddling\n\nUnited States intelligence officials warned in mid-February that Russia had already begun meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. But Mr. Trump continued to suggest other countries could also be the culprit.\n\n\u201cBy the way, I have to say, Obama was the president during all of this meddling, or whatever you want to call it, with Russians and others possibly,\u201d he said in a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News.\n\nDecember 2017: Conflicting signals on national security\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first national security strategy blueprint made repeated references to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and its \u201cinformation operations as part of its offensive cyberefforts to influence public opinion across the globe.\u201d\n\nYet in his speech announcing the strategy on Dec. 18, Mr. Trump made one fleeting mention of Russia: of how it and China \u201cseek to challenge American influence, values and wealth.\u201d He made no mention of Russian meddling and instead praised intelligence sharing between Russia and the United States in the face of terrorism threats.\n\nAugust 2017: Signing a sanctions bill reluctantly\n\nAfter Congress passed legislation in late July to impose sanctions on Russia and limit the president\u2019s authority to lift them, Mr. Trump signed the bill but criticized it as \u201cseriously flawed \u2014 particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch\u2019s authority to negotiate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump signed the legislation on Aug. 2. Several days earlier, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government had retaliated by seizing two American diplomatic compounds in Russia and telling the United States Embassy in Moscow to reduce its staff across the country. Mr. Trump did not respond, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to comment.\n\nHowever, the State Department described Moscow\u2019s move as \u201ca regrettable and uncalled-for act.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it,\u201d the department said in a statement.\n\nJuly 2017: Suggesting he found Mr. Putin\u2019s denial persuasive\n\nAfter Mr. Trump met with Mr. Putin during a Group of 20 summit meeting, he recounted the Russian leader\u2019s assurances that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cFirst question \u2014 first 20, 25 minutes \u2014 I said, \u2018Did you do it?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, I did not, absolutely not.\u2019 I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that was published on July 12. \u201cSomebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn\u2019t have found out about it.

In a statement about his briefing on the cyberattacks that day, Mr. Trump pointed to \u201cRussia, China, other countries.\u201d\n\nDays before his inauguration, at a Jan. 11 news conference where he was asked whether he believed Mr. Putin ordered the hacking of American political committees, Mr. Trump said that \u201cas far as hacking, I think it was Russia.\u201d\n\nHe then added, \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s dismissiveness of accusations of Russian interference predates his time in the White House.\n\nLate December 2016: Praising Putin in the wake of sanctions\n\nOn Dec. 29, President Barack Obama issued sanctions against Russia and ejected 35 suspected Russian intelligence operators from the United States as punishment for Moscow\u2019s attempts to influence the election. But in a move widely believed to be aimed at fostering good relations with the incoming Trump administration, Mr. Putin announced on Dec. 30 that he would not retaliate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump promptly praised Mr. Putin\u2019s decision.\n\nA day later, Mr. Trump said he still wasn\u2019t convinced that Russia had interfered in the election, telling reporters: \u201cAnd I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.\u201d\n\nEarly December 2016: Disparaging intelligence agencies after reports on Russian interference\n\nAfter reports in December by the The New York Times and The Washington Post that United States intelligence assessments had concluded that Russian election meddling sought to aid Mr. Trump, the president-elect disagreed.\n\nIn an unsigned statement responding to the news, the Trump transition team dismissed the assessment by comparing it to flawed intelligence reports in the lead-up to the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOctober 2016: Questioning intelligence consensus that Russia is to blame\n\nOn Oct. 7, the United States intelligence community released a joint public statement saying it was \u201cconfident that the Russian government\u201d had directed cyberattacks on American individuals and institutions, including political organizations such as the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThree days after that, during the second presidential debate, Mr. Trump again cast doubt that Russia was responsible \u2014 or even that there was a cyberattack in the first place.\n\n\u201cMaybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nSeptember 2016: Continuing to cast doubt on Russian meddling\n\nAs the official nominees of their parties, Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton began receiving intelligence reports in early August. On Sept. 22, top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees issued a statement saying that they had \u201cconcluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,\u201d based on briefings they had received.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFour days later, during the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the D.N.C.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O.K.?\u201d\n\nJune 2016: Rejecting the D.N.C. claim that Russian hackers penetrated its files\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and a cybersecurity firm said that Russian hackers had obtained a trove of internal campaign emails and political opposition research.\n\nIn response, Mr. Trump suggested that the D.N.C. fabricated the story or hacked itself: \u201cWe believe it was the D.N.C. that did the \u2018hacking\u2019 as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader,\u201d he said in a campaign statement on June 15.\n\nHe did not mention Russia.", "keywords": ["russian", "mr", "meddling", "administration", "trump", "split", "statement", "states", "intelligence", "hacking", "2016", "russia"], "polarity": 0.023875999156898035, "subjectivity": 0.3109968059406261},

And the cast is set to grow.\n\nThe television pundit Larry Kudlow, best known for his patter on CNBC, was named on Wednesday as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser. Pete Hegseth, a co-host of \u201cFox & Friends Weekend,\u201d is on the short list to become secretary of veterans affairs. John R. Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador and a frequent Fox News commentator, is under consideration for national security adviser.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe moves are another sign that the dividing line between media and government has been all but erased under Mr. Trump, a former reality star who views himself as the casting agent in chief.\n\nTelevision figures have served as press aides in past administrations, tasked with handling their former colleagues in the media. But the selection of Mr. Kudlow crossed a threshold of sorts: the elevation of a television star to a position of real influence over policies affecting millions of Americans.\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that Mr. Trump, whose view of the world is indelibly shaped by what he sees on TV, would be a president eager to break the fourth wall.\n\nPeople close to him have said a major part of his deliberative process is how a decision will play on cable news. Where previous presidents courted news personalities, Mr. Trump consults them, seeking policy and strategic advice from Fox News hosts like Jeanine Pirro, who at one point was interviewed for the job of deputy attorney general, and Sean Hannity.\n\nAt least three Fox News hosts \u2014 Tucker Carlson, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Laura Ingraham \u2014 were approached about joining his communications team. Last week, Mr. Trump dined at the White House with Jesse Watters, the Fox News co-host of \u201cThe Five,\u201d who is best known for ambush interviews and an offensive video mocking Asian-Americans, for which he later apologized.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow Mr. Trump is inviting the commentators to shape the policy they comment on. Mr. Hegseth, if hired for the veterans affairs job, would be in charge of reforming a bureaucracy that administers benefits to millions.\n\nMr. Kudlow, a zealous advocate of lowering taxes on the wealthy, will be expected to forge an economic policy that, until this week, he had the luxury of merely judging from the safe harbor of a television studio.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a hall-of-mirrors moment on Wednesday, Mr. Kudlow went on television to describe how Mr. Trump was impressed with how he appeared on television.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re on the air,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I\u2019m looking at a picture of you,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Very handsome,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kudlow said during a chummy interview with his soon-to-be-former CNBC colleagues. He let out a laugh: \u201cSo Trumpian!\u201d\n\nInstalling the TV crowd in this West Wing could play out in unpredictable ways.\n\nThe administration spurred an international incident last year after Sean Spicer, its press secretary at the time, repeated an unsupported accusation about a British spy agency\u2019s wiretapping of the Trump campaign. The source? Andrew Napolitano, the TV judge and Fox News legal analyst, who made the claim on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Trump later defended Mr. Napolitano, saying, \u201cAll we did was quote a very talented legal mind.\u201d\n\nThen came the incident involving Omarosa Manigault Newman, who made a name for herself as the villain of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2004 and lasted a year in the administration as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison.\n\nAfter she left her position, the reality-show presidency collided with an actual reality show: Ms. Newman joined the cast of \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d and impugned the Trump administration as \u201cso bad.\u201d\n\nThe White House decided to respond \u2014 on live television. \u201cOmarosa was fired three times on \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 and this was the fourth time we let her go,\u201d a deputy press secretary, Raj Shah, said during a White House briefing. (Unsurprisingly, after the back-and-forth, the ratings for \u201cBig Brother\u201d went up.)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe empty-calorie genres of reality shows and cable punditry, which fill the hours with ginned-up conflict, can be a strange fit for the more consequential environment of the White House. The Newman uproar, in particular, seemed to knock some of Washington\u2019s more levelheaded commentators off kilter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt feels like we have reached a level of crazy in this White House, and it is difficult to take it anymore,\u201d Chuck Todd said on MSNBC after Mr. Shah\u2019s comments.\n\nMr. Kudlow\u2019s arrival in Washington could cause similar anxiety.\n\nThe CNBC host\u2019s smooth demeanor is catnip for the image-focused Mr. Trump, who chose Mr. Kudlow despite his opposition to tariffs authorized by the White House this month. But Mr. Kudlow is more familiar with television lights than the glare that comes with public service; his Washington experience is largely limited to a 1980s stint as a bureaucrat in Ronald Reagan\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nHis predecessors who led the National Economic Council include Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Gary D. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn 1972, when Nixon nominated Mr. Scali for his ambassadorship, he was choosing someone who had spent a year in the White House as an image consultant. Mr. Scali had also played a diplomatic role in managing the Cuban missile crisis, acting as a covert liaison between Soviet officials in Washington and the Kennedy administration.\n\nStill, the choice of Mr. Scali had its detractors: News of his nomination prompted a New York Times editorial that denounced the \u201cdowngrading of the United Nations\u201d and asked why Nixon had picked him \u201cto fill a position once held with distinction by Adlai E. Stevenson.\u201d\n\nMr. Kudlow offers another test case for how a TV personality can make the transition. But he will have to contend with one of Mr. Trump\u2019s peculiar traits: The president often prefers the pundits he watches on television to the advisers who work in his West Wing.\n\n\u201cHe got hired because the president has seen him on TV,\u201d Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington, said. \u201cTo stay hired, he\u2019s going to have to continue to be on TV.

Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nSupporters of the law viewed the ruling as a victory, including conservative leaders in other states seeking to pass similar bans on sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Florida tried but failed to pass a bill banning sanctuary cities this legislative session. But the Republican speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran, who has pushed for a crackdown, said the ruling on Tuesday in the Texas case would help their cause.\n\n\u201cThe linchpin of the sanctuary defenders\u2019 argument was that courts would find such legislation unconstitutional,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said in a statement. \u201cWe knew they were wrong, and today the court agreed. Any elected official who thinks they can choose which laws they will and will not follow is sadly mistaken and this ruling reinforces that fundamental American truth.\u201d\n\nIn addition to prohibiting sanctuary policies, S.B. 4 threatens officials who violate the law with fines, jail time and removal from office. The measure was backed by the state\u2019s Republican governor and lieutenant governor, and passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nAustin, Dallas, Houston and other cities and counties sued Texas to block the law, saying it was unconstitutional, opened the door to racial profiling and would make documented and undocumented immigrants fearful of reporting crimes and cooperating with the police.\n\nThe ruling on Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit only complicates the situation. Parts of the law went into effect after a court ruling in September. The Fifth Circuit opinion allows nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions to kick in, although lawyers for the localities and groups suing the state said they were considering appealing the decision to either the full Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite upholding most of the law\u2019s provisions, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision could narrow the effect of the law. The ruling suggested that local officials who limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement because of limited resources were not necessarily violating the law.\n\n\u201cIt is not 100 percent obvious what is allowed and not allowed as far as policymaking,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents San Antonio and other jurisdictions and groups in the lawsuit. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be put into effect in the field.\u201d\n\nThe Fifth Circuit judges struck down one provision of the law \u2014 a clause that had barred officials even from endorsing policies that limit immigration enforcement, which the judges said violated the First Amendment. But some local leaders are concerned that the free speech rights of city employees remain restricted by the law, because the judges lifted the endorsement prohibition only for elected officials and not for nonelected government personnel.\n\nOn Wednesday in San Antonio, some of those dynamics seemed to be at play. Shortly before the start of a news conference held by groups opposed to the law, Councilman Rey Salda\u00f1a wondered whether the city\u2019s police chief, William McManus, would speak at the event.

He added, \u201cWe have to resist and we have to let him know that California doesn\u2019t welcome him.\u201d\n\nNeal Jos\u00e9 Wilkinson, a pastor in San Diego, made a plea for civil disobedience. Saying that Jesus was killed because he broke the rules, Mr. Wilkinson declared, \u201cThere\u2019s a higher authority than you Donald Trump!\u201d\n\nThere were softer appeals, as well. \u201cI ask you to keep building bridges of love, of kindness to other people,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Castillo, the pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, the Catholic church where the rally was held.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s welcome committee of a few hundred people, many dressed in the flag, gathered for what was part pep rally and part celebration of what they viewed as the fulfillment of a campaign promise: the construction of a wall to keep undocumented Mexican immigrants away. To a scratchy rendition of Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.,\u201d mixed with clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, supporters cast themselves as \u201cdeplorables\u201d and enthusiastic gun owners, and hoped for a glimpse of the president\u2019s motorcade.\n\n\u201cHe said secure the borders, build the wall, everything,\u201d said Julie Horn, explaining her support. Her husband, Scott, a retired construction worker, echoed her views. \u201cI think he\u2019s done great,\u201d he said. As Trump supporters in California, they said they were living in the state only to be close to their grandchildren.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t put a Trump sticker on your car,\u201d Ms. Horn said. \u201cYour car will get smashed.\u201d\n\nNot all of the faces at the rally were white. Kathy Robinson, who is African-American and from Burbank, and who works as a wedding photographer and Uber driver, voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. But after the election, she said she regretted that, and had come to view undocumented immigrants as a menace who take jobs away from American citizens. \u201cTrump is not racist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just against illegal immigrants. He loves black people.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Mr. Trump addressed a hangar full of enthusiastic military service members at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar before attending a fund-raiser expected to raise $5 million at the home of Edward Glazer, a chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has stayed away from California until now, realizing that the state is beyond his reach in 2020 if he runs for re-election, as he says he will. But he noted that he owns property in the state. \u201cThe taxes are way, way out of whack,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand people are going to start to move pretty soon.\u201d\n\nAt the border, Mr. Trump inspected eight wall prototypes, all of them looming over him. The border section he visited is currently guarded by a wire fence and sheet metal barrier, which local border patrol agents said have cut down on crossings since they were first put up. Mr. Trump argued that they need to be replaced by something more permanent and impenetrable. He expressed a preference for the models that have slats allowing border patrol officers to see through them.\n\nAs Mexicans watched from across the barrier, Mr. Trump described an epidemic of drugs and human traffickers that he has vowed to stop. He argued that building a wall would cost less than what he said was the price of social ills created by illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cWe need safety,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe need security at the border and we\u2019re getting it like we\u2019ve never had it before.

Ford; as general counsel of the Navy under President Jimmy Carter; and, under President Ronald Reagan, on a panel that found complicity by the Salvadoran authorities in covering up the murder of four Roman Catholic churchwomen from the United States.\n\nPresident George W.

(The first black to hold the post was Clifford L. Alexander, appointed by President Carter.) Mr. West succeeded John W. Shannon, the acting secretary, who was charged with shoplifting a blouse and skirt worth $30 from the post exchange at Fort Myer in Virginia. (The charges were dismissed.)\n\nAs secretary in the years after the Gulf War, Mr. West managed base closings and troop reductions that constituted the largest military demobilization since World War II. He also administered the Clinton administration\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, intended to accommodate gay soldiers.\n\nMr. West clashed with Army brass who objected to his plan to expand the role of women in combat.

Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices.\n\nThe \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students.\n\nIn recent months, educators and policy experts from across the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a series of public forums.\n\nAt a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers, educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some black attendees walked out.\n\nSince the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline.\n\nBut proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.\n\nWhen the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions.\n\n\u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student\u2019s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day \u2014 the student\u2019s fifth and sixth referrals that year.\n\nWhile Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded.\n\nThe Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s effort to connect the district\u2019s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to dismantle a program that\u2019s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,\u201d Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. \u201cWe will neither manage nor lead by rumors.\u201d", "keywords": ["law", "guidance", "mr", "obama", "rights", "program", "rubio", "education", "unlikely", "trump", "discipline", "school", "finds", "shootings", "students", "policies", "culprit"], "polarity": 0.05929752786895644, "subjectivity": 0.4110812996527283},

(We do not meet Perry or Don.) But who gets to \u201ccount\u201d as diverse is one of the play\u2019s horrible-hilarious wrangles. In an argument with Roberta, a member of Hillcrest\u2019s development staff, Sherri insists that the school\u2019s admissions catalog must depict a student body that is visually diverse \u2014 so Perry, who is light-skinned, doesn\u2019t count. To comply, Roberta (Ann McDonough) has to stage photos that feature recognizably dark-skinned students, reading \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d no less.\n\nPerry may not be black enough for the catalog, but Charlie certainly thinks he was black enough for Yale, and accepted for that reason. In an astonishing 17-minute howl of disappointment, he undoes a lifetime of indoctrination as he dissects the logical fallacies on which, he feels, his parents\u2019 values \u2014 and Yale\u2019s, and Hillcrest\u2019s \u2014 are based.\n\nPhoto\n\nIs Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a person of color?

Should white people hate white people?\n\nThe evening I saw it, this line of thought had the audience roaring and clapping and then seeming to want to retract both responses as Charlie veered into ever more uncomfortable ideas.\n\nThat\u2019s good satire at work, causing us to think critically about people we don\u2019t at first recognize as images of ourselves. And the discomfort only deepens when Charlie, stung by his parents\u2019 reaction to his tirade \u2014 his father calls him a spoiled brat \u2014 reconsiders his position and makes a startling decision.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her assumptions of privilege, however unexamined, will not be denied. The crux of Mr. Harmon\u2019s argument, which is as tightly constructed as a finger-trap toy \u2014 almost every piece of information supplied at the start pays off by the end \u2014 is that hypocrisy may look a lot like love.\n\nSatires don\u2019t usually go there. Recent racial comedies, like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d and Bruce Norris\u2019s \u201cClybourne Park,\u201d have been built on ludicrously bad behavior, and let the results speak for themselves. \u201cAdmissions\u201d is less extreme but also, as a result, harder to put across. The characters are caught somewhere between well-observed types and absurd caricatures. Sherri\u2019s mama bear ferocity is necessary to turn the plot, just as Charlie\u2019s hysteria about Yale is, but in real life both would be subtler. Of course, in real life this plot wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t happen onstage. As in his previous plays \u201cBad Jews\u201d and \u201cSignificant Other,\u201d Mr. Harmon is admirably unafraid of portraying incorrectness in the guise of sour comedy. In a way, Charlie is a combination of Daphna, the relentless scold of \u201cBad Jews,\u201d and Jordan, the whiny wallflower of \u201cSignificant Other.\u201d But \u201cAdmissions\u201d is even better for being about something substantially larger than one character\u2019s unhappiness.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not sure that Daniel Aukin\u2019s warm and intermittently rollicking production finds the right tone. Though there are moments in which the mere placement of bodies on the Newhouse\u2019s thrust stage is enough to make you anxious, there are too many others that seem to pull back from the blinding clarity that\u2019s needed. (Mark Barton\u2019s lighting is way too gentle.) When the actors, generally working in a naturalistic vein, tear into their characters\u2019 most unhinged moments they seem to be grinding gears. You find yourself questioning the likelihood of their behavior when, ideally, you would be too breathless to study it.\n\nNo matter. One of the things the theater should be doing today, and rarely does, is lancing the boil of our own self-deception. \u201cAdmissions,\u201d as that pun of a title suggests, is a kind of confessional, except that no forgiveness is offered, or deserved.", "keywords": ["admissions", "white", "charlie", "reading", "york", "review", "parents", "bad", "yale", "pieties", "skewering", "diversity", "perry", "characters"], "polarity": 0.05541869588744589, "subjectivity": 0.4884913870851372},

Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nSupporters of the law viewed the ruling as a victory, including conservative leaders in other states seeking to pass similar bans on sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Florida tried but failed to pass a bill banning sanctuary cities this legislative session. But the Republican speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran, who has pushed for a crackdown, said the ruling on Tuesday in the Texas case would help their cause.\n\n\u201cThe linchpin of the sanctuary defenders\u2019 argument was that courts would find such legislation unconstitutional,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said in a statement. \u201cWe knew they were wrong, and today the court agreed. Any elected official who thinks they can choose which laws they will and will not follow is sadly mistaken and this ruling reinforces that fundamental American truth.\u201d\n\nIn addition to prohibiting sanctuary policies, S.B. 4 threatens officials who violate the law with fines, jail time and removal from office. The measure was backed by the state\u2019s Republican governor and lieutenant governor, and passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nAustin, Dallas, Houston and other cities and counties sued Texas to block the law, saying it was unconstitutional, opened the door to racial profiling and would make documented and undocumented immigrants fearful of reporting crimes and cooperating with the police.\n\nThe ruling on Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit only complicates the situation. Parts of the law went into effect after a court ruling in September. The Fifth Circuit opinion allows nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions to kick in, although lawyers for the localities and groups suing the state said they were considering appealing the decision to either the full Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite upholding most of the law\u2019s provisions, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision could narrow the effect of the law. The ruling suggested that local officials who limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement because of limited resources were not necessarily violating the law.\n\n\u201cIt is not 100 percent obvious what is allowed and not allowed as far as policymaking,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents San Antonio and other jurisdictions and groups in the lawsuit. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be put into effect in the field.\u201d\n\nThe Fifth Circuit judges struck down one provision of the law \u2014 a clause that had barred officials even from endorsing policies that limit immigration enforcement, which the judges said violated the First Amendment. But some local leaders are concerned that the free speech rights of city employees remain restricted by the law, because the judges lifted the endorsement prohibition only for elected officials and not for nonelected government personnel.\n\nOn Wednesday in San Antonio, some of those dynamics seemed to be at play. Shortly before the start of a news conference held by groups opposed to the law, Councilman Rey Salda\u00f1a wondered whether the city\u2019s police chief, William McManus, would speak at the event.

According to the 2016-18 report on Cancer Facts and Figures for African-Americans, \u201cdespite lower incidence rates for breast and uterine cancers, black women have death rates for these cancers that are 42 percent and 92 percent higher, respectively, than white women.\u201d Investigators connect the ghastly numbers to the usual socioeconomic discrepancies but also to biological differences in the malignancies of black women.\n\nWith regard to breast cancer, is the mortality gap related to a greater percentage of black women than white women contending with an aggressive form of the disease that lacks estrogen receptors?\n\nDr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, rejects an explanation based on \u201cbiological difference,\u201d pointing instead to dietary disparities.\n\nDisadvantaged Americans consume more calories and carbohydrates, \u201cthe sort of food that is available in poor areas of inner cities,\u201d Dr. Brawley writes in his book \u201cHow We Do Harm.\u201d Greater body weight means African-American girls menstruate earlier and the number of uninterrupted menstrual cycles increases the risk of breast cancer: \u201cThe black-white gap in the onset of menstruation and body weight has dramatically widened, which means that the disease disparities will widen also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Brawley quotes an all-white study in Scotland that \u201cfound evidence pointing to a correlation between social deprivation and incidence of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptors.\u201d In addition, he cites the insight of his friend Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute: \u201cPoverty is a carcinogen.\u201d\n\nGiven the mortality discrepancies, it is disturbing that African-Americans are underrepresented as subjects in cancer research, as are other minorities. According to research by Dr. Narjust Duma of the Mayo Clinic, only 6 percent of participants in clinical trials are black, although African-Americans make up approximately 12 percent of the population; Hispanics amount to 3 percent of participants, although they make up about 15 percent of the population.\n\n\u201cIf our government doesn\u2019t fix this,\u201d one protester in \u201cCompany Town\u201d says, \u201cthen I don\u2019t know what kind of government they are.\u201d If we don\u2019t fix this, I chime in, what sort of people are we?", "keywords": ["dr", "matters", "women", "gap", "mortality", "continue", "cancer", "brawley", "cancers", "black", "breast"], "polarity": 0.04489312770562769, "subjectivity": 0.360705266955267},

She was later named deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force.\n\nIn addition to his wife and his daughter Hilary, Mr. West is survived by another daughter, Tiffany West Smink, and two grandchildren.\n\nAfter clerking for Federal District Judge Harold R. Tyler Jr. in New York, Mr. West was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Field Artillery Corps and attained the rank of captain in the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps, where he served until 1973.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter working in the Carter administration, he became managing partner at the New York law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler and a senior vice president of the Northrop Corporation (now Northrop Grumman), a major defense contractor, before joining the Clinton administration.\n\nMr. West was named Army secretary in 1993. (The first black to hold the post was Clifford L. Alexander, appointed by President Carter.) Mr. West succeeded John W. Shannon, the acting secretary, who was charged with shoplifting a blouse and skirt worth $30 from the post exchange at Fort Myer in Virginia. (The charges were dismissed.)\n\nAs secretary in the years after the Gulf War, Mr. West managed base closings and troop reductions that constituted the largest military demobilization since World War II. He also administered the Clinton administration\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, intended to accommodate gay soldiers.\n\nMr. West clashed with Army brass who objected to his plan to expand the role of women in combat. He eventually compromised on a plan that allowed them to be assigned to about two in three Army jobs but barred them from others, including operation of an advanced air defense field artillery weapons, helicopters that fly cover for tanks and special operations forces.\n\nHe served until 1998, when he was appointed to the cabinet-level Veterans Affairs post, succeeding the first black to hold that post, Jesse Brown, and serving until July 2000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006 Mr. West was president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington think tank that focuses on issues of particular concern to black people.\n\nVernon Jordan, a former adviser to President Clinton, suggested in a telephone interview that Mr. West \u2014 perhaps beginning with the classical education imparted by his parents \u2014 seemed destined to join the one in 10 black men whom W.

Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices.\n\nThe \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students.\n\nIn recent months, educators and policy experts from across the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a series of public forums.\n\nAt a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers, educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some black attendees walked out.\n\nSince the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline.\n\nBut proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.\n\nWhen the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions.\n\n\u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student\u2019s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day \u2014 the student\u2019s fifth and sixth referrals that year.\n\nWhile Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded.\n\nThe Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s effort to connect the district\u2019s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to dismantle a program that\u2019s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,\u201d Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. \u201cWe will neither manage nor lead by rumors.\u201d", "keywords": ["law", "guidance", "mr", "obama", "rights", "program", "rubio", "education", "unlikely", "trump", "discipline", "school", "finds", "shootings", "students", "policies", "culprit"], "polarity": 0.05929752786895644, "subjectivity": 0.4110812996527283},

Recent racial comedies, like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d and Bruce Norris\u2019s \u201cClybourne Park,\u201d have been built on ludicrously bad behavior, and let the results speak for themselves. \u201cAdmissions\u201d is less extreme but also, as a result, harder to put across. The characters are caught somewhere between well-observed types and absurd caricatures. Sherri\u2019s mama bear ferocity is necessary to turn the plot, just as Charlie\u2019s hysteria about Yale is, but in real life both would be subtler. Of course, in real life this plot wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t happen onstage.

Though there are moments in which the mere placement of bodies on the Newhouse\u2019s thrust stage is enough to make you anxious, there are too many others that seem to pull back from the blinding clarity that\u2019s needed. (Mark Barton\u2019s lighting is way too gentle.) When the actors, generally working in a naturalistic vein, tear into their characters\u2019 most unhinged moments they seem to be grinding gears.

The coverage prompted Republicans to speculate about whether relaxed disciplinary policies had allowed the violent track record of Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the shooting, to evade law enforcement.\n\nDebbie York, the teacher who raised the issue in a Breitbart News article, was forced to retire after a first grader in her suburban Minnesota school pushed her, injuring her back and neck. The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident.\n\nThe story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers\u2019 authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms. Ms. York is advocating that the law go national, and that the Obama guidance be repealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about arming teachers with guns; it is about arming them with the freedom to talk about troubled kids whose behavior not only needs to be assessed, but when the behavior puts others at risk of serious harm, intervention other than therapy,\u201d Ms. York said.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been eyeing the guidance for reversal since she took office, will head a White House commission on school safety that has been specifically tasked with examining whether to repeal the discipline guidance.\n\nCivil rights groups and congressional Democrats are standing by the guidance and pointing to evidence that suspensions are helping to drive the achievement gap between white and minority students. Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point.

One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["national", "guidance", "district", "punished", "quandary", "white", "districts", "confronts", "ms", "discipline", "school", "minnesota", "students", "black", "teachers"], "polarity": 0.034482293662621545, "subjectivity": 0.3891631183024627},

A sea of IndyCars buzzed violently around the streets of this winsome little Florida city, and the vehicular throng could not be more thrilling or more vibrant. The world was suddenly alive with metallic, high-speed color, and the sweet thrill of my Hot Wheels childhood came rushing back.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe sound of 24 IndyCars in flat-out combat was a hivelike buzzing \u2014 a high-intensity hum that faded when the cars rounded a curve out of sight but that re-upped when they appeared in the straightaway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Firestone Grand Prix is the annual opening race of the Verizon IndyCar Series.

According to the 2016-18 report on Cancer Facts and Figures for African-Americans, \u201cdespite lower incidence rates for breast and uterine cancers, black women have death rates for these cancers that are 42 percent and 92 percent higher, respectively, than white women.\u201d Investigators connect the ghastly numbers to the usual socioeconomic discrepancies but also to biological differences in the malignancies of black women.\n\nWith regard to breast cancer, is the mortality gap related to a greater percentage of black women than white women contending with an aggressive form of the disease that lacks estrogen receptors?\n\nDr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, rejects an explanation based on \u201cbiological difference,\u201d pointing instead to dietary disparities.\n\nDisadvantaged Americans consume more calories and carbohydrates, \u201cthe sort of food that is available in poor areas of inner cities,\u201d Dr. Brawley writes in his book \u201cHow We Do Harm.\u201d Greater body weight means African-American girls menstruate earlier and the number of uninterrupted menstrual cycles increases the risk of breast cancer: \u201cThe black-white gap in the onset of menstruation and body weight has dramatically widened, which means that the disease disparities will widen also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Brawley quotes an all-white study in Scotland that \u201cfound evidence pointing to a correlation between social deprivation and incidence of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptors.\u201d In addition, he cites the insight of his friend Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute: \u201cPoverty is a carcinogen.\u201d\n\nGiven the mortality discrepancies, it is disturbing that African-Americans are underrepresented as subjects in cancer research, as are other minorities. According to research by Dr. Narjust Duma of the Mayo Clinic, only 6 percent of participants in clinical trials are black, although African-Americans make up approximately 12 percent of the population; Hispanics amount to 3 percent of participants, although they make up about 15 percent of the population.\n\n\u201cIf our government doesn\u2019t fix this,\u201d one protester in \u201cCompany Town\u201d says, \u201cthen I don\u2019t know what kind of government they are.\u201d If we don\u2019t fix this, I chime in, what sort of people are we?", "keywords": ["dr", "matters", "women", "gap", "mortality", "continue", "cancer", "brawley", "cancers", "black", "breast"], "polarity": 0.04489312770562769, "subjectivity": 0.360705266955267},

The last time he was released, a nurse practitioner came the following afternoon to check on him. When she buzzed the doorbell, there was no answer, so she tried us. We let her in, only to discover that our tenant had pulled out his catheter and was incoherent. The nurse practitioner called 911, and the police arrived and did an assessment; they recommended that our tenant be moved to a place where his needs could be met. But they said moving him against his will would require a social worker\u2019s recommendation, plus other legal actions.\n\nWe could not reach his relative by phone, despite multiple attempts. She came the next day to bring him back to the hospital to reinsert the catheter.

But I\u2019m worried that our tenant will try to cook something and start a fire, injuring himself and possibly our family. And while I sympathize with his relative, I also worry that she is being grossly careless. My inclination is to follow up on the report recommending that he be moved to a suitable facility, rather than wait to see if action is taken. What would you suggest?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nName Withheld\n\nWe lose the right to manage our own life only when we become incapable of responsible decision-making. And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a house he inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans. I really had no recourse but to stay there, as he was my transport to the airport several hours away, and I did. In retrospect, I worry about him and his mental state. What can I do?\n\nName Withheld\n\nHow long has he been in the house? If he\u2019s in the process of discarding the detritus of his parents\u2019 lives, it may just be that this is going slowly, especially if he\u2019s an only child. He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem. He might resent the observation, but the chance that you could spur him to seek the help he needs would be worth risking your not-very-close relationship.", "keywords": ["left", "relative", "youre", "tenant", "place", "nurse", "warn", "needs", "renters", "york", "racist", "neighbors", "stay", "house"], "polarity": 0.09738230519480523, "subjectivity": 0.36862554112554113},

Wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, Bannon\u2019s advice is strange. After all, by any normative understanding, \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cxenophobe\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d are negative words from both a moral and rational point of view. Their definitions, taken from any standard dictionary, will bear this out. Racism, xenophobia and nativism embody, in their very meanings, both irrationality and unfairness. Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it. And he recommends presenting such irrationality as virtuous.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["trying", "mr", "diversify", "employees", "googles", "internal", "work", "fired", "google", "diversity", "damore", "hard", "lawsuit"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Asked if her resignation had to do with the direction Ms. Freiman was taking the institute, or rather her management style, William A.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity.

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion.

The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident.\n\nThe story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers\u2019 authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms.

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C.

They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators\u2019 perception of both.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pressure cooker,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the district\u2019s chief of schools. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across America.\u201d\n\nWhile critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.\n\nBernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["national", "guidance", "district", "punished", "quandary", "white", "districts", "confronts", "ms", "discipline", "school", "minnesota", "students", "black", "teachers"], "polarity": 0.034482293662621545, "subjectivity": 0.3891631183024627},

Last year, Australia agreed to pay $53 million in damages to migrants who said they had suffered abuse in the camps.\n\nMr. Dutton has been a staunch defender of the offshore detention policy, and he has argued that Australia should not accept refugees who would be a burden on the country\u2019s social safety net.\n\nIn January, Mr. Dutton blamed African migrants for a rise in crime in Melbourne, claiming in an interview that residents of the city were afraid even to go to restaurants at night \u201cbecause they\u2019re followed home by these gangs.\u201d\n\nCritics of the government said that those remarks were intended to scare voters before an election and that official crime data showed no such correlation with immigration.\n\nAccording to government statistics, more immigrants to Australia are born in South Africa than in any other African country. As of 2016, 181,400 Australian residents were South African natives, according to the latest census. The government does not break down that figure by race, but white South Africans have been moving to Australia in large numbers for decades.\n\nThe question of redistributing white-owned farmland to blacks in South Africa became an issue again in February when Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president.", "keywords": ["australia", "african", "sign", "mr", "calls", "white", "south", "york", "farmers", "australian", "emergency", "africa", "dutton", "official", "visas", "migrants", "race"], "polarity": 0.0395820449391878, "subjectivity": 0.26645923520923526},

According to the 2016-18 report on Cancer Facts and Figures for African-Americans, \u201cdespite lower incidence rates for breast and uterine cancers, black women have death rates for these cancers that are 42 percent and 92 percent higher, respectively, than white women.\u201d Investigators connect the ghastly numbers to the usual socioeconomic discrepancies but also to biological differences in the malignancies of black women.\n\nWith regard to breast cancer, is the mortality gap related to a greater percentage of black women than white women contending with an aggressive form of the disease that lacks estrogen receptors?\n\nDr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, rejects an explanation based on \u201cbiological difference,\u201d pointing instead to dietary disparities.\n\nDisadvantaged Americans consume more calories and carbohydrates, \u201cthe sort of food that is available in poor areas of inner cities,\u201d Dr. Brawley writes in his book \u201cHow We Do Harm.\u201d Greater body weight means African-American girls menstruate earlier and the number of uninterrupted menstrual cycles increases the risk of breast cancer: \u201cThe black-white gap in the onset of menstruation and body weight has dramatically widened, which means that the disease disparities will widen also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Brawley quotes an all-white study in Scotland that \u201cfound evidence pointing to a correlation between social deprivation and incidence of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptors.\u201d In addition, he cites the insight of his friend Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute: \u201cPoverty is a carcinogen.\u201d\n\nGiven the mortality discrepancies, it is disturbing that African-Americans are underrepresented as subjects in cancer research, as are other minorities.

But they said moving him against his will would require a social worker\u2019s recommendation, plus other legal actions.\n\nWe could not reach his relative by phone, despite multiple attempts.

But I\u2019m worried that our tenant will try to cook something and start a fire, injuring himself and possibly our family. And while I sympathize with his relative, I also worry that she is being grossly careless. My inclination is to follow up on the report recommending that he be moved to a suitable facility, rather than wait to see if action is taken.

And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a house he inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans. I really had no recourse but to stay there, as he was my transport to the airport several hours away, and I did. In retrospect, I worry about him and his mental state. What can I do?\n\nName Withheld\n\nHow long has he been in the house?

He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem.

It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it.

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Credit Janet Van Ham/Nickelodeon, via Associated Press\n\nThe film industry\u2019s historic lack of representation prompted us at Race/Related to ask: When was the first time you saw yourself represented on the silver screen?\n\nWe published our responses in an article, \u201cWhen Hollywood Is Our Mirror.\u201d Then we asked for your answers to the same question. About 100 readers responded. Here are a selection of them, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\n\u201cThe Brothers Garcia\u201d on Nickelodeon. It was my happiest TV day ever! The family on TV looked and acted very much like mine, and everybody at school loved it! The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out. Like when someone asks Poitier: \u201cWhy are you wearing white man\u2019s clothes?\u201d I get that look today sometimes!\n\n\u2014 Andre Graves\n\nI first saw black actors who made an impression on me during the 1970s era of Blaxploitation films. \u201cShaft,\u201d \u201cSuperfly,\u201d Pam Grier, etc ... They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out. I\u2019m not Chinese; I\u2019m Korean and was adopted by a white family as a baby, but in a media landscape that still largely excludes people of East Asian descent, I\u2019ll celebrate what I can get.\n\n\u2014 Amanda McClendon\n\nI\u2019m a white woman. Moira Shearer in \u201cRed Shoes.\u201d I was perhaps 8 years old. I grew up in a small town in North Texas. As a child I loved \u201cSong of the South\u201d and had read \u201cUncle Remus\u201d before I saw it. I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture. For once, Africans were good people in a movie, although it was fictional.\n\n\u2014 Khalifah Makgotlho\n\nThe 1972 film \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d starring Peggy Pettit as an aspiring modern dancer.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004. Both those movies, seen at age 7 and 9, inspired me to become the drummer and dancer I am today, at 23. It was impossible to know then, but representation matters!\n\n\u2014 Taylor Alarcon\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for representation. The closest I\u2019ve come is with \u201cSmoke Signals.\u201d But as a biracial person, I\u2019m not a \u201creal\u201d Native American, according to some, but I also wasn\u2019t raised like my white peers. I believe that this constant social navigation is ripe for exploration.\n\n\u2014 India Lovato\n\nIn 1988, I saw \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War.\u201d Most of the characters were Mexican and they were just portrayed as people, not some \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d joke. It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967. It was Jim Brown in \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d: a strong, brave, athletic black man fighting with the good guys against the bad guys.\n\n\u2014 Darren Casonhua\n\nIt may seem bizarre, but \u201cMoonlight\u201d helped me better understand myself as an upper-middle-class heterosexual white woman growing up in the Midwest. Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s. The first film I saw people who looked like me and behaved in ways I recognized was \u201cParis Blues\u201d with Sidney Poitier and Diahann Carroll, who were in love and kissed on screen. Amazing!\n\n\u2014 Donna Bailey\n\nThe first time I saw myself represented was in high school. Spike Lee made an all-black musical, \u201cSchool Daze,\u201d and I was in awe. I clearly remember sitting in my seat amazed at seeing all of the different shades of black people on the big screen and feeling proud because I was finally being seen through them.\n\n\u2014 Cathleen Jagarnauth\n\nI\u2019m a white, 68-year-old woman and the first time I saw myself on the screen was in 1987 when Holly Hunter was in \u201cBroadcast News.\u201d She was opinionated, pushy, demanding and terribly emotionally fragile, taking a few minutes to cry. When her producer told her it must be nice to know exactly what everyone else should be doing, she said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d When the movie ended I literally sat in the movie theater and cried in recognition.\n\n\u2014 Carolyn Langenkamp\n\nFor more coverage of race, sign up to have our newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.", "keywords": ["mirror", "movie", "movies", "film", "hollywood", "white", "screen", "im", "representation", "saw", "black", "mulan"], "polarity": 0.10436236628385391, "subjectivity": 0.37851373832778806},
{"title": "\n                    Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html", "text": "\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe division within Google spilled into the open last year when James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a memo critical of its diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["trying", "mr", "diversify", "employees", "googles", "internal", "work", "fired", "google", "diversity", "damore", "hard", "lawsuit"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Ms. Freiman declined to comment further.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe timing raised questions about whether Ms. Freiman\u2019s activist agenda gave the university or the I.C.A. board cold feet. Asked if her resignation had to do with the direction Ms. Freiman was taking the institute, or rather her management style, William A. Royall Jr., co-chairman of the I.C.A. board, said: \u201cThere were no reservations about the curatorial direction she was taking whatsoever,\u201d without addressing the rest.\n\nThe show will go on as planned, led by the I.C.A.\u2019s chief curator, Stephanie Smith. \u201cThe exhibition is functioning as a declaration of intent for the I.C.A. being an institution that\u2019s going to grapple directly with issues that matter in our world through supporting artists\u2019 diverse voices,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nAlmost half the artists have been commissioned to make new work for the show. Tania Bruguera, Hope Ginsburg, Titus Kaphar, Lee Mingwei, Amalia Pica and Betty Tompkins, among others, deal head on with issues of race, gender, the environment, social dysphoria and the possibility for repair.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmos Paul Kennedy Jr., a letterpress printmaker based in Detroit, collaborated with barbershops and salons near the I.C.A., social sites where the African-American population in particular gathers. \u201cHe thought that would be a great way to reach out and speak to an audience that might not otherwise be aware of the I.C.A. or think that it was a place for them,\u201d Ms. Smith said. Over the course of six months, the artist collected snippets of conversation from patrons on issues of the day.\n\nMr. Kennedy then distilled the text into hundreds of brightly colored letterpress prints that will wallpaper the entrance wall to the I.C.A. \u201cRichmond citizens will walk in and see their own voices reflected on the wall of the institution,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nMr. Rucker, who is in residence at V.C.U., working with students, is interspersing historical artifacts related to the Ku Klux Klan with his refashioned Klansmen robes.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view! If reason and deliberation are central to democracy, how on earth did Donald Trump get elected?\n\nIf you were born after 1990, it\u2019s not totally shocking that you would see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe.

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses. The first would be in revolutions \u2014 the French, Russian, Chinese and all the other ones that unleashed the passion of the mob in an effort to overthrow oppression \u2014 and the way they ALL wound up waist deep in blood.\n\nThe second would be in constitutionalism.
