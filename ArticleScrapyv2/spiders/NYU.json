An upswing in the support of white, working-class voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin helped deliver Mr. Trump the White House, despite his popular vote loss.\n\nThose voters will be critical both to Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign in 2020 and to Republican fortunes in the midterm elections in November. If, as Mr. Trumka suggested, support is eroding, then the president\u2019s hold on the Rust Belt would be shaky.\n\nMr. Trumka said the president had been generous with access to the Oval Office and administration officials, and he described Mr. Trump as \u201ccharming person to person.\u201d One meeting scheduled to last 30 minutes went on for nearly three hours, he said.\n\nBut those meetings, and the president\u2019s affability, failed to yield results, Mr. Trumka said: \u201cAccess isn\u2019t the problem. Impact is the question. Is the access having any impact? So far I would say we haven\u2019t done real well.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have a president who is on all sides and no side.\u201d\n\nOn specific issues, Mr. Trumka criticized Mr. Trump for failing to \u201clabel China as a currency manipulator\u201d and said the president had rejected plans to \u201crevitalize our coal communities.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Labor unions will also target another dozen states.\n\nHistorically, labor has aligned strongly with the Democratic Party, but Mr. Trump\u2019s election showed that many in the rank and file were open to a Republican candidate. Mr. Trumka said union members were willing to vote for Mr. Trump because they felt establishment candidates in both parties had failed them, and they were ready to give the first-time politician \u201ca chance.\u201d\n\nNow, he said, workers are far less enthusiastic. The tax cut plan, Mr. Trumka said, favored companies over workers, adding that it \u201crewards outsourcing\u201d of jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing hasn\u2019t matched up with what he\u2019s said,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.\n\nIn the last election, Mr. Trump outperformed Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, by four percentage points among union members. But, Mr. Trumka noted, Hillary Clinton underperformed President Barack Obama by about 10 percentage points among union members.\n\nInstead of delivering change, Mr. Trump is \u201cdoubling down on everything that got us to this point,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, referring to the president\u2019s tax and economic policies.\n\nBut Mr. Trumka also cautioned Democrats to outline an agenda that would appeal to union workers or risk losing their votes again in the midterm elections.\n\nMr. Trumka had initially joined the president\u2019s business council, but resigned in August after the president\u2019s seemingly ambivalent remarks about racists protesting in Charlottesville, Va.", "keywords": ["midterm", "president", "republican", "workers", "hurt", "actively", "union", "trump", "presidents", "chief", "trumka", "having", "mr", "losing", "support"], "sentiment": 0.12045601790499749},

Rather than a blanket restriction, his executive order specified that White House officials could not lobby the agencies they served, and did not cover congressional officials.\n\nBut he has not taken any action on two other promises. Mr. Trump has yet to propose term limits for members of Congress or enact a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\n\nForgoing a salary\n\nMr. Trump, a billionaire, vowed to not take \u201ceven one dollar\u201d of his $400,000 annual salary as president, following in the footsteps of presidents like John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover.\n\nSo far, he has kept his word, donating his paychecks to the National Park Service in the first quarter of 2017, the Education Department in the second, and then the Health and Human Services Department in the third to help combat the opioid crisis. The White House would not answer questions about what Mr. Trump would do with his paychecks in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Though tax lawyers may advise against it, the I.R.S. has said that an audit does not prevent individuals from releasing their own tax information. The Trump campaign also released a letter from his lawyers that said Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, before 2009, were \u201cclosed administratively\u201d \u2014 or no longer subject to an audit.\n\nBut in May, Mr. Trump reneged on the promise in an interview with The Economist, moving the release date to \u201cafter I\u2019m out of office.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPlaying golf only in the interest of the country\n\nAfter incessantly chastising President Barack Obama for golfing, Mr. Trump promised during the campaign that \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to be working for you, I\u2019m not going to have time to go play golf.\u201d He later made an exception for \u201cleaders of countries and people who can help us.\u201d\n\nYet Mr. Trump has played more golf than his predecessor, according to independent trackers.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s golf partners. While he played a round with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in February, he was also accompanied by professional golf players, not world leaders, for at least four games.\n\nTaking no vacations\n\nMr. Trump pledged to \u201cnot be a president who took vacations\u201d and blasted Mr. Obama for his own personal trips.\n\nIn a 2012 report, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the president is \u201calways on duty\u201d and that his vacations are considered official travel.\n\nOver the past year, Mr. Trump has taken some R&R. He spent 17 days in at his golf club in New Jersey, which the White House labeled a \u201cworking vacation,\u201d and voyaged to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a holiday respite that included presidential duties.\n\nIt is unclear how those trips were different from the vacations that Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama for taking. The former president, for example, spent holidays in Hawaii \u2014 a frequent talking point of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 where he played golf, received intelligence briefings and visited troops.\n\nOver all, Mr. Trump has visited a Trump property one out of every three days since taking office.", "keywords": ["president", "white", "trumps", "tax", "pledges", "vacations", "service", "presidency", "trump", "house", "golf", "look", "mr", "later"], "sentiment": 0.02265800865800866},

The pragmatic Mr. Schumer has made no apologies for his efforts to protect Democrats from conservative states, offering Mr. Manchin plum committee assignments in the aftermath of the 2016 election when Mr. Trump was wooing the senator for a cabinet post.\n\nSenate Democrats had to hold something of an intervention to persuade Mr. Manchin to run for re-election. Recognizing the statement that his abrupt retirement would send about centrism and the political bind it would leave Democrats in this November, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, another Trump-state Democrat, prompted other moderates to lobby Mr. Manchin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The report will aid the agency in its review of applications for lower-risk tobacco products and the potential harm or benefits those pose to individuals and the public.\n\nOn Wednesday, an F.D.A. advisory panel will review an application from Philip Morris International for iQOS, an electronic device that unlike e-cigarettes, contains tobacco in a stick that the company says heats it but does not burn it. It releases nicotine vapor, which the company says is less hazardous than smoke. If approved, it would be the first company allowed by the government to claim its product is less harmful than cigarettes.\n\nAlso this week, on Friday, the agency\u2019s new nicotine steering committee will hold a public hearing on over-the-counter therapeutic products, among them gums, patches and lozenges, designed to help smokers quit.\n\nCessation was one area where the committee\u2019s report did give the booming e-cigarette industry some good news. It pointed out the benefits for smokers trying to quit. But people who continue to smoke cigarettes, alternating with e-cigarettes, do not gain the same health benefits, the committee said. That\u2019s especially important given that most adults who vape also still smoke or use other tobacco products. The report also said the evidence was limited on whether e-cigarettes were effective for quitting smoking.\n\nWhile there is no evidence at this time that e-cigarettes or their components cause cancer, the committee recommended more long-term research. Some e-cigarettes do contain chemicals and metals whose long-term effects \u2014 including on pregnancy \u2014 also need further study, the committee said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSmoking rates among adults and teenagers have declined significantly over the last few decades. In 2015, the last year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has statistics, about 37 million Americans, 15 percent of adults aged 18 and older, smoked cigarettes. The number has declined from nearly 21 percent of every 100 adults in 2005; and 42 percent in 1965.\n\nWith that decline, the e-cigarette industry has emerged as a potential substitute and Big Tobacco has been among the device developers enjoying new profits from the tobacco alternatives. Bonnie Herzog, a well-known Wells Fargo tobacco analyst, predicted the industry will grow about 15 percent to $5.1 billion in retail sales in the United States, in 2018. Of that, she noted that $1.6 billion will be spent on the pre-filled cartridges sold mostly by the big tobacco companies, and $3.5 billion on open vapor systems; the liquid refill products, most of which are sold at vape shops.\n\nThe vaping industry, as well as traditional tobacco companies, are gearing up for a lengthy fight with the F.D.A. over the campaign by the agency\u2019s commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, to slash levels of nicotine in traditional cigarettes to nonaddictive or minimally addictive levels.\n\nDr. Gottlieb is expected to issue an initial proposal, calling for public comment on lower nicotine levels, in the near future.\n\nThe new report reflects the complexity of the issues surrounding e-cigarettes and the balancing act tobacco regulators face over the pros and cons of the many alternatives to conventional cigarettes.\n\nAdam Leventhal, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, and an author of the report, said his group did an exhaustive literature search, reviewing all studies on youths and e-cigarette use from around the world. Of those, 10 studies were deemed strong enough to address the question. But they did not show that using e-cigarettes caused teens to move on to tobacco, only that the use of e-cigarettes was associated with later smoking of at least one traditional cigarette. The report noted that more than 11 percent of all high school students had reported using e-cigarettes within the past month, a total of nearly 1.7 million youths.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cThe evidence was substantial that this association was consistent across a number of research methodologies, age ranges, locations, and research groups in and outside the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Leventhal said.\n\nThis conclusion is at odds with the findings of the British Royal College of Physicians, which asserts that e-cigarettes are not a gateway to smoking.\n\n\u201cConcerns about e-cigarettes helping to recruit a new generation of tobacco smokers through a gateway effect are, at least to date, unfounded,\u201d the organization notes on its website.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore intriguing was the newest report\u2019s finding of moderate evidence that youths who use e-cigarettes before trying tobacco are more likely to become more frequent and intense smokers.\n\nCritics have long contended that the flavored liquids for the devices are luring adolescents to the habit, at a time when nicotine is especially hazardous for their brain development. Three of the top-selling flavors at e-liquid.com, a large online retailer, include \u201cUnicorn Milk\u201d (strawberries and cream), \u201cTNT\u201d (strawberry, apple and peach) and \u201cI Love Donuts\u201d (blueberries and pastry).\n\nThe authors of the new report cite conclusive evidence that vaping can be addictive, and that exposure to nicotine from e-cigarettes is highly variable, depends on the characteristics of the device, as well as how it is used. They also cited conclusive proof that in addition to nicotine, most e-cigarettes also contain and emit numerous potentially toxic substances.\n\nIn terms of second hand vapor, the committee said there was conclusive evidence that e-cigarette use increases airborne concentrations of particulate matter and nicotine indoors.\n\nThe report concluded that much of the current research on e-cigarettes is flawed,\n\neither in methodology or because of industry-financed bias. In addition, the levels of nicotine and other chemicals, including metals, vary in e-cigarettes from brand to brand, which has complicated some research findings.\n\n\u201cAnd for kids who initiate on e-cigarettes, there\u2019s a great chance of intensive use of cigarettes. As the regulator, we\u2019ve got to factor all that in,\u201d Mr. Zeller said.\n\nIn July, the F.D.A. delayed the deadline at least four years for e-cigarette companies to apply for agency approval to keep their products on the market, largely by showing some public health benefit. The agency did not postpone other aspects of its tobacco control program, including requirements for mandatory age and photo-ID checks to prevent illegal sales to minors and the banning of free samples.\n\nSeveral major tobacco companies that produce e-cigarettes declined to comment on the report. Azim Chowdhury, a partner in the Keller and Heckman law firm, who represents some businesses and trade groups in the industry, said the report\u2019s main conclusions were positive. \u201cThey indicate that there are substantial benefits for smokers to switch to vaping completely,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut public health advocates who objected to the July delay, said this report gave them further concern.\n\n\u201cWhat the report demonstrates is that despite the popularity of e-cigarettes, little is known about their overall health effects, and there is wide variability from product to product,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, President of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cThat makes the case even stronger for F.D.A. regulation.\u201d\n\nThe vaping industry was cautiously optimistic about the influence of the report. Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, a nonprofit that advocates for vapor products, said the findings were consistent with those reached by the Royal College of Physicians and other institutions in Britain that have issued reports indicating e-cigarettes are less dangerous than traditional smoking and help with cessation.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of this report, it is more apparent than ever that true leadership is needed in public health to ensure that adult smokers have access to truthful information about the benefits of switching to smoke-free products,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the F.D.A., Dr. Gottlieb said the report would play a critical role.\n\n\u201cWe need to put novel products like e-cigarettes through an appropriate series of regulatory gates to fully evaluate their risks and maximize their potential benefits,\u201d he said.", "keywords": ["research", "committee", "health", "teenagers", "lure", "smoking", "concludes", "ecigarettes", "tobacco", "products", "industry", "report", "science", "panel", "nicotine", "addictive", "fda", "vaping"], "sentiment": 0.09913699898774524},

Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last week that global temperatures last year receded slightly from the record-setting 2016, because there was no El Ni\u00f1o heating up the Pacific.\n\nWarmer and Warmer The balance after 30 years of climate diplomacy: a hotter world with more greenhouse gases.

Hoping to appease island nations like the Maldives, which are likely to be swallowed by a rising ocean in a few decades, they set a new \u201caspirational\u201d ceiling of 1.5 degrees.\n\nTo stick to a 2 degree limit, we would have to start reducing global emissions for real within about a decade at most \u2014 and then do more. Half a century from now, we would have to figure out how to suck vast amounts of carbon out of the air. Keeping the lid at 1.5 degrees would be much harder still.\n\nAnd yet, when experts tallied the offers made in Paris by all the countries in the collective effort, they concluded that greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would exceed the level needed to remain under 2 degrees by 12 billion to 14 billion tons of CO 2 .\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAre there better approaches? The \u201cclimate club\u201d proposed by the Yale University economist William Nordhaus has the advantage of including an enforcement device, which current arrangements lack: Countries in the club, committed to reducing carbon emissions, would impose a tariff on imports from nonmembers to encourage them to join.\n\nMartin Weitzman of Harvard University supports the idea of a uniform worldwide tax on carbon emissions, which might be easier to agree on than a panoply of national emissions cuts. One clear advantage is that countries could use their tax revenues as they saw fit.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Barrett argues that the Paris agreement could be supplemented with narrower, simpler deals to curb emissions of particular gases \u2014 such as the 2016 agreement at a 170-nation meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, to reduce hydrofluorocarbon emissions \u2014 or in particular industries, like aviation or steel.\n\nMaybe none of this would work. The climate club could blow up if nonmembers retaliated against import tariffs by imposing trade barriers of their own. Coordinating taxes around the world looks at least as difficult as addressing climate change. And Mr. Barrett\u2019s proposal might not deliver a breakthrough on the scale necessary to move the dial.\n\nBut what definitely won\u2019t suffice is a climate strategy built out of wishful thinking: the proposition that countries can be cajoled and prodded into increasing their ambition to cut emissions further, and that laggards can be named and shamed into falling into line.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And the group is closing doors that it would do best to keep open.\n\nThere is no momentum for investing in carbon capture and storage, since it could be seen as condoning the continued use of fossil fuels. Nuclear energy, the only source of low-carbon power ever deployed at the needed scale, is also anathema. Geoengineering, like pumping aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect the sun\u2019s heat back into space, is another taboo.\n\nBut eventually, these options will most likely be on the table, as the consequences of climate change come more sharply into focus. The rosy belief that the world can reduce its carbon dependency over a few decades by relying exclusively on the power of shame, the wind and the sun will give way to a more realistic understanding of possibilities.\n\nSome set of countries will decide to forget Paris and deploy a few jets to pump sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to cool the world temporarily. There will be a race to develop techniques to harvest and store carbon from the atmosphere, and another to build nuclear generators at breakneck speed.\n\nIt will probably be too late to prevent the Maldives from ending up underwater.

If it did not, there would be two major sets of consequences. For one, the World Trade Organization could greenlight other countries\u2019 setting similar trade limits. More broadly, it would raise the question of whether the United States accepts the organization\u2019s decisions all \u2014 Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has argued for years that such decisions should, essentially, be advisory.\n\nThe United States market has long been very attractive to foreign companies, and not just for its large and affluent set of consumers. Its tariffs on imports are much lower than those of most other countries, and it also has relatively low sales taxes. But President Trump has regularly questioned whether existing free trade agreements are in the best interests of the country, making it possible that such favorable terms may erode.\n\nStill, China and South Korea have leverage of their own. They are big importers of American-made machinery and agricultural products, and China, in particular, has long been a big buyer of soybeans and other crops from states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nIndeed, as an enormous consumer of all types of global goods, China could also easily punish American companies by opting to buy from international competitors. For instance, it could opt for Airbus planes over Boeing\u2019s or crack down on General Motors while leaving Volkswagen alone.\n\nA trade fight would, however, be painful. Both China and South Korea export a lot more to the United States than they import, meaning higher tariffs could hit their economies harder.\n\nWho else could be affected?\n\nThe United States accuses China of swamping the market with artificially cheap, subsidized solar panels. But increasingly, those panels come from elsewhere. Steep tariffs imposed in 2012 on solar panels imported from China have made it cheaper for Chinese companies to assemble the panels in factories elsewhere before shipping them to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCountries like Malaysia and South Korea now account for most of the United States\u2019 solar imports, according to data from Global Trade Atlas, a database maintained by the research firm IHS Markit.\n\n2011 2017 Malaysia South Korea Vietnam China Thailand Mexico 13% 1% 0% 59% 0 11% 31% 21% 14% 11% 9% 5% 2011 2017 Malaysia South Korea Vietnam China Thailand Mexico 13% 1% 0% 59% 0 11% 31% 21% 14% 11% 9% 5%\n\nChinese companies like JA Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have opened factories in Malaysia, though most such businesses still do much of their research and development at home.\n\nThe broad manufacturing base means other countries may face job losses and other hardships in the face of the United States tariffs, which could galvanize opposition to the president\u2019s action.\n\nAmerican companies also manufacture some of their panels in Southeast Asia before importing some of them back into the United States. But their products tend to use a different technology, known as thin-film solar panels, which are not covered by the latest tariffs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is also exploring a major trade action against China focused on intellectual property.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s regulatory authorities do not allow U.S. companies to make their own decisions about technology transfer and the assignment or licensing of intellectual property rights,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s office said as part of a broader report last week, suggesting possible strong action.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move nevertheless leaves room for negotiation.\n\nThe tariffs announced on Monday on solar panels were not as high as American companies had requested. And with washing machines, the tariffs were somewhat higher than requested, but the administration said the higher rate would not kick in until the United States imports 1.2 million washers. A lower charge will apply to any imports below that threshold.\n\nHe Weiwen, a former Chinese Commerce Ministry official who is now an influential trade policy researcher in Beijing, said Chinese policymakers had reacted with \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d to the tariffs.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html", "text": "Already, Democrats acknowledge that Mr. Steyer has helped force impeachment into mainstream conversation, playing to a liberal base that has cheered confrontational tactics like the three-day government shutdown. While Democrats intend to run on a fiercely anti-Trump message this year, party leaders envision a campaign of broad attacks on the president\u2019s economic agenda rather than a blunt-force impeachment pledge. There is no realistic chance of impeaching Mr. Trump while Republicans control Congress, and Democrats from moderate and conservative districts fear the idea could alienate voters otherwise likely to vote their way in November.\n\nBut the Democratic base, enraged by Mr. Trump and frustrated by party leaders counseling restraint, appears enthusiastically open to seeking the president\u2019s removal. A handful of Democratic congressional candidates \u2014 in crucial states like California, Florida, Nevada and Wisconsin \u2014 have vowed to pursue impeachment if they are elected. That number is likely to grow during the coming season of Democratic primaries, in which throngs of candidates are competing for the affection of liberal voters who loathe the president.\n\nMary Barzee Flores, a former circuit court judge who is one of more than a half-dozen Democrats seeking a Republican-held seat in Miami, said the issue had plainly resonated with voters in the area, where Mr. Trump is unpopular. Ms. Barzee Flores, who endorsed impeachment in a newspaper column last fall, said Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, had been a breaking point for her. She is preparing to launch impeachment-themed TV ads of her own.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cLike a lot of people, I am appalled by the president\u2019s conduct in office,\u201d Ms. Barzee Flores said in an interview, adding: \u201cI do believe that there\u2019s a basis to impeach the president, and I do believe that he\u2019s got to go. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Barzee Flores said Democrats should not treat impeachment as a singular issue in 2018, over matters like health care and immigration. \u201cThere are other issues that are pressing,\u201d she said. \u201cMore pressing, even.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Steyer, however, impeachment is a singular cause. And he is no easy character for Democrats to ignore: From his headquarters in a San Francisco office tower, Mr. Steyer, 60, has built a sprawling political operation with more than 200 staff members around the country, mostly employed by his flagship group, NextGen America, which focuses on climate change.\n\nMr. Steyer has amassed a mixed win-loss record over the years, along with a mercurial reputation among Democratic strategists. But he is nearly alone among Democratic donors in his willingness to spend money on a titanic scale. In 2016, Mr. Steyer spent more than $90 million supporting Democrats, and his checkbook may be critical to their efforts to capture Congress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeparate from the impeachment drive, Mr. Steyer, who made his fortune as a hedge fund investor, announced this month that he would spend $30 million on mobilizing young voters in 2018. He has already quietly funneled nearly $2 million into a union-backed effort to capture seven Republican-held seats in California, three strategists directly involved in the campaign said.\n\nBut on impeachment, Democrats in Congress have made no secret of their skepticism. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leaders in the House and Senate, have called it a premature proposal. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a hero of the left, said Democrats should avoid \u201cjumping the gun\u201d on such a drastic action. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has urged candidates to use more measured language, endorsing investigations of Mr. Trump but avoiding an impeachment pledge.\n\nMs. Pelosi, who has a longstanding relationship with Mr. Steyer and hosted him in her private box at the Democrats\u2019 2016 convention, conveyed her concerns to him directly. She told Mr. Steyer in a phone call last fall that impeachment was a profoundly divisive issue and stressed that other matters, like the Republican-backed tax overhaul, were more urgent, according to four people briefed on the conversation.\n\nBut Mr. Steyer insisted that Mr. Trump had more than met the standard for being removed from office, and said his ads were electrifying the Democratic base. The conversation was cordial, according to associates of both Democrats, but neither gave ground.\n\nMr. Steyer, his friends say, has been more pointed in private, appearing indifferent or even emboldened by the criticism of Democrats in Washington. Two of his friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Steyer has taken to declaring that when Ms. Pelosi or Mr. Schumer is complaining, he knows he is on the right track.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer are not alone in their reservations. An impeachment resolution introduced last year by Representative Al Green, a Democrat of Texas, garnered only 58 votes in December. (When Mr. Green pushed for a vote for the second time in January, that number rose only slightly, to 66.)\n\nEven if the House did vote to impeach Mr. Trump \u2014 perhaps under possible Democratic control in 2019 \u2014 it would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to remove him from office \u2014 a threshold that could only be met with the help of a sizable number of Republicans. That appears an extremely remote possibility.\n\nRepresentative Brendan Boyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania who voted against the impeachment resolution, warned that pressing now could backfire badly. Voicing the exasperation of many of his colleagues, Mr. Boyle called the Steyer campaign a fruitless exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see how the ads achieve anything,\u201d Mr. Boyle said. \u201cTo do this now, before Special Counsel Mueller finishes the investigation, only complicates our job if Mueller finds something that warrants impeachment, which I believe is a real possibility.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic base appears more receptive: Seventy percent of Democrats favor impeachment hearings, according to an NBC News/The Wall Street Journal poll published last month. Overall, 41 percent of Americans support impeachment hearings \u2014 an unusually high number for a president in his first year, but well short of an electoral majority.\n\nIf Mr. Steyer\u2019s focus on impeachment is new, his status as one of the most mercurial figures in Democratic politics is not. He has pursued a number of political adventures over the last few years, often hiring expensive consultants and spending heavily on advertising, and then abruptly moving on to an entirely new project.\n\nLast year, Mr. Steyer embarked on a kind of political star search, gathering national political strategists, including top advisers to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, to map out a run for governor or Senate. After briefly threatening to challenge Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fellow Democrat, Mr. Steyer abandoned plans to run for office in 2018.\n\nFormer Representative Ellen Tauscher, a Northern California Democrat, said Mr. Steyer had plainly embraced a provocateur\u2019s role instead of putting his name on the ballot this year. But Ms. Tauscher, who leads a \u201csuper PAC\u201d targeting California Republicans, warned that voters might balk at electing a Congress bent on driving Mr. Trump from office.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a conversation about impeachment until you take the House back, and so this is a little bit like somebody who\u2019s jumped ahead,\u201d Ms. Tauscher said, adding of Mr. Steyer: \u201cI think, to a certain extent, Tom knows this.\u201d", "keywords": ["steyer", "office", "pushing", "democrats", "trump", "voters", "impeach", "impeachment", "billionaire", "number", "mr", "democratic", "ms", "keeps", "rattled"], "sentiment": 0.0384873222016079},

He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nScholars and activists alike say his management skills were crucial in turning the S.C.L.C. from a largely volunteer organization into a national power in the civil rights movement, with a million-dollar budget and 100 full-time workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA March 1964 report by the Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace, which investigated civil rights-era militants, subversives and communists, described Dr. Walker as \u201cthe real leader of the Negro movement.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201cbrilliance as a strategist was his greatest contribution to the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes from a time when civil rights leaders were martyrs, and not marketers,\u201d Mr. Jackson added. \u201cAnd he knew how to harness the energies of people who were excited about social change, and how to use the church as the center of his advocacy for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed.\u201d\n\nWyatt Tee Walker, a grandson of a former slave, was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in the shoemaking town of Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. John Wise Walker and the former Maude Pinn. His father had been a member of the first graduating class of Virginia Union University in 1899 and read both Greek and Hebrew. His mother was also a Union graduate, and books filled the family home.\n\nWhen Wyatt was a child the family moved to southern New Jersey, where his father had obtained a post preaching at a small black church in Merchantville. The heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, who had grown up there, was a family friend.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the pulpit produced little income; the family was impoverished during the Depression, Mr. Walker told a biographer for a dissertation; he would put cardboard in his shoes to cover holes in the soles. Five of his siblings died of childhood diseases before he was old enough to remember them, he said.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Merchantville in 1946, he went south to Virginia Union, carrying $100 that his parents had given him as tuition money to cover the first two semesters. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in both physics and chemistry in 1950, graduating with high honors.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe received his master of divinity degree from Union three years later. He also held a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester. (The Crozer seminary in Pennsylvania had merged with Colgate Rochester in 1970.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn authority on gospel music and a composer of religious music as well, Dr. Walker published several books and articles that dealt with the relationship among music, black religious tradition and social change. He was also noted for his photography, the subject of exhibits.\n\nOrdained in 1952, he preached for seven years at the Gillfield Baptist Church in Petersburg, Va. He staged numerous acts of civil disobedience during this time, resulting in 17 arrests. The first one came after he led a group of black men and women through the \u201cwhites only\u201d door of the local library.\n\nIn Petersburg, he served as president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state director of the Congress of Racial Equality and founder of the Petersburg Improvement Association, modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association, which guided the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nDr. Walker worked for the S.C.L.C. in Atlanta for four years before moving to Harlem, in 1965, when he was named pulpit minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church.\n\nTwo years later, he became pastor and chief executive of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, a post he held until a series of strokes forced him to retire in 2004. He then moved to Virginia to be closer to relatives.\n\nDr. Walker married Theresa Edwards on Dec. 24, 1950. She survives him, as do a daughter, Patrice Walker Powell; three sons, Robert, Earl and Wyatt Jr.; a sister, Mary Holley; and two granddaughters.\n\nDuring his long tenure at Canaan Baptist, in the heart of Harlem at 115th Street between St. Nicholas and Lenox Avenues, Dr. Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly and what the church calls the oldest senior services center in Harlem.\n\nIn 1999, he was instrumental in establishing Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Dr. Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu). He was a strong advocate of providing parents with taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools, a position that put him at odds with champions of public schools in Harlem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Dr. Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank, which sought to fill Harlem\u2019s economic needs in the absence of major banks for a quarter-century, until it collapsed in 1990 under the weight of risky loans, and the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, which the church says was responsible for $100 million in housing.\n\nFor Dr. Walker, the civil rights movement had not ended with legislative victories in the 1960s. In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our children to have a choice that was better than drugs,\u201d he told The Times in 2015, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy aspirin\u201d in the neighborhoods, \u201cbut you could buy any kind of drug.\u201d The police, he said, were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said had shrugged off the threats.\n\n\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations.

It stands to gain by sowing discord between the United States and its allies and, more broadly, by extending diplomatic influence in the region. They also speculate that Turkey, in return for Moscow\u2019s forbearance, has agreed to turn a blind eye to Russian and Syrian attacks on rebels in Idlib Province, who are nominally allied with Turkey against the Syrian government.\n\nThe United States has taken some steps to reassure Mr. Erdogan. It stopped supplying heavy weapons to the Kurds, now that the operation to retake the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa is finished. But administration officials said they were determined to continue their relationship with the Kurds because of their effectiveness in fighting militants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent weeks, senior American officials have talked about the need to re-establish security in northern Syria by installing local security forces that reflect the demographics of those areas before the civil war. That would require the return of tens of thousands of Arabs who fled Syria during the fighting.\n\nMr. Tillerson outlined the strategy in a speech last week in which he said the United States would keep troops in Syria for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cISIS presently has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, questioned whether the administration had the diplomatic muscle, political commitment or military staying power to put that strategy into effect. Even now, some noted, many of its statements are still narrowly focused on the fight against the Islamic State and do not take account of the common interest Turkey and the United States have in resisting Russia, Iran and the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe United States, some analysts said, needs to make a better case to the Turkish government for why the American alliance with the Syrian Kurds will most likely outlast the war against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cWe told the Turks that the Kurds were temporary, tactical, and transactional to defeat ISIS,\u201d said James F. Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Turkey and Iraq. \u201cNow we need them to contain Iran.\u201d\n\nHe said the administration was sending mixed messages to the Turks, which antagonized Mr. Erdogan and made it impossible for him to turn a blind eye to the links between the Syrian Kurds and the P.K.K.\n\n\u201cThe whole purpose of this is to split the Russians from the Syrians by saying we\u2019re going to stay on to force a political solution in Syria,\u201d Mr. Jeffrey said. \u201cWe have a seeming inability, in our various public announcements, to send this message to the Turks.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Turkish operations have been limited to targets around Afrin, which lies about 25 miles north of Aleppo and about 75 miles from the main Kurdish areas east of the Euphrates River.

Although I am a conservative professor, I recommend making a concession to it by explicitly assigning writers of different races and social backgrounds. Let me explain.\n\nWhen I was in college, I took a class in logic. There I learned that one should never reject an argument because of the characteristics of the person making it. Instead, one should assess the argument itself on its rational merits. And while I agree that the power of an argument should not depend on the person making it, nonetheless, it does.\n\nI learned that lesson during my first year as a visiting professor at Cornell University. I taught a course on American evangelicals, which attracted a mix of secular and religious students. When we discussed \u201cThe Scandal of the Evangelical Mind,\u201d a 1994 book by Mark A. Noll about anti-intellectualism in the evangelical tradition, my evangelical students were critical of it. But they were willing to take the book\u2019s thesis seriously because the author was an evangelical.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Noll\u2019s identity shouldn\u2019t have mattered. His historical evidence and the power of his arguments would be worth considering even if he were Catholic, Jewish or secular. But his identity did matter. It mattered because my evangelical students could not simply assume bad faith on the author\u2019s part. They knew Mr. Noll cared about evangelicals as a group of people. Instead of dismissing Mr. Noll as a bigot, my students thoughtfully engaged with his work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

I currently teach a course called Black Intellectuals, which is focused on debates around racial inequality in the post-civil rights era. It tends to attract progressive students who, in analyzing racial inequality, are drawn to arguments that stress structural obstacles to equality and the enduring power of white racism, especially in our criminal justice system. The course features black authors who do defend that view, but I also teach the work of others who depart from it in some measure, including heterodox thinkers like Thomas Chatterton Williams and conservatives like Jason Riley. Much like my conservative evangelical students at Cornell, my progressive students at Claremont McKenna College are less likely to assume these contrarian black thinkers are acting in bad faith or are motivated by bigotry \u2014 even when the thinkers criticize hip-hop culture or defend white police officers. So the students engage the challenging arguments and ideas instead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs conservatives have long observed and psychologists have since confirmed, human beings are hive-minded animals whose moral judgments are shaped more by sentiments than by reason. Thus, when we are confronted by arguments we disagree with, we can easily find reasons to reject them. The search for disconfirming evidence, however, can sometimes be short-circuited, especially when we feel close to the person making an argument we disagree with. As the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt concluded in his 2012 book, \u201cThe Righteous Mind,\u201d if we have \u201caffection, admiration, or desire to please\u201d other people, we lean toward them and attempt to \u201cfind the truth\u201d in their arguments.

Ms. Collins approached Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat and the coalition\u2019s co-chairman, on the Senate floor, and within hours a group of 17 senators were crowded into her office to sketch out terms of engagement.\n\nThe group eventually came to include a broad swath of institutionally minded senators, including the Republicans Jeff Flake of Arizona, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Mike Rounds of South Dakota, and the Democrats Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMembers of the group spent the weekend shuttling between Ms. Collins\u2019s overcrowded office, where they snacked on Girl Scout cookies and popcorn, and the office suites of Mr. McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer, the party leaders. As the weekend wore on, the group kept growing, up to 25 by Monday \u2014 crowded enough that one senator had to sit on a credenza.\n\nThey cycled through a series of ideas: Further shortening the length of the short-term spending bill; attaching a bill to protect Dreamers to another piece of must-pass legislation; demanding that Mr. McConnell put an immigration bill authored by Mr. Graham and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, on the floor for a vote. Each was eventually deemed untenable.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, the group had settled on a compromise that would fund the government for three weeks alongside a commitment by Mr. McConnell that the Senate would move expeditiously to take up the immigration issue. The challenge was getting the leaders to agree.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. McConnell signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their suggestion, saying on the Senate floor that it was \u201cmy intention\u201d to move ahead with immigration legislation.\n\nBut Democrats, led by Mr. Schumer, wanted more. The issue was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. Democrats have not forgiven Mr. McConnell for blocking the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland for almost a year in hopes that a Republican would be elected to the White House.\n\nAsked Monday morning how much of an issue that mistrust was, Mr. Manchin was clear. \u201cUh, most of it,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Schumer asked Ms. Collins to meet him in his office late Sunday after Mr. McConnell\u2019s remarks and said he needed more clarity and assurance from the majority leader. Mr. Flake, who had initially supported the shutdown along with most Democrats, worked into the night with Ms. Collins to edge Mr. McConnell toward a more explicit statement.\n\nMonday morning, he firmed up his pledge enough to win over Democrats, saying that the Senate\u2019s immigration debate would have \u201ca level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.\u201d Behind the scenes, Republicans in the bipartisan group who had tied their interests to Democrats vouched for Mr. McConnell\u2019s word.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said before, \u2018Trust but verify,\u2019\u201d Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said of Mr. McConnell. \u201cHe made this commitment publicly in the Senate floor.

And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.\u201d\n\nBy the time Democratic and Republican senators met privately with their respective caucuses later Monday morning, it was clear it was enough to get to yes. Mr. Schumer told Democrats he would support reopening the government.\n\nNot all Democrats were convinced. Senator Kamala D. Harris, Democrat of California and one of more than a dozen liberal Democrats who voted against the funding bill, said Mr. McConnell\u2019s comments on Sunday night \u201cfell far short of the ironclad guarantee\u201d she needed.\n\nBut Mr. Flake said the Republican leader had made clear to Democrats he had done what he could do.\n\n\u201cStanding on the floor and saying we are going to proceed to an immigration bill in this environment with this kind of attention being paid to it is a pretty good promise,\u201d he said.", "keywords": ["stick", "mcconnell", "floor", "republican", "senator", "office", "democrats", "hand", "talking", "moderate", "shutdown", "senate", "broke", "senators", "group", "mr", "immigration"], "sentiment": 0.15504086430810565},

The question is whether the best way to protect them, and the best way to elect politicians who will help them in the long term involves keeping immigration policy in the political spotlight for weeks on end.\n\nThe smart move now for Democrats is to accept a short-term funding bill that ends the shutdown and defuses the tension.

Kendi\u2019s take on racism in the United States is hard to swallow, but he is right. Even if you count yourself among those who despise racism, you reap the benefits of whiteness or the penalties of blackness, depending on the color of your skin. Until institutional racism, legislative racism, economic racism and social racism are dismantled, we are all still drinking at the same poisoned well.\n\nYet, I am hopeful because, day by day, according to Nicholas Kristof, the world is getting to be a better place.

But when we take a step back and look in the greater context of American politics, we see a troubling trend. As Mr. Kendi reminds us, eight presidents owned slaves while in office. Lyndon B.

Given this, it is simply natural that at one level all of us are racists and all of us have certain innate tribal tendencies. However, at the same time human beings have the capacity to understand that skin color is not a legitimate or even practical means of measuring or comparing individual human worth, character or potential. This assumption lies at the heart of modern democracy, the American Constitution and an efficient global economy.\n\nIf indeed at one level all of us are born with racist tendencies, feeling a natural preference for those who look like us, then what does it mean to be called a \u201cracist\u201d? Unfortunately, it is a descriptor that has been used so often in recent years that it has lost its meaning. The fact is there is a condition in some Americans, including our president, that runs much deeper than simple \u201cracism,\u201d a condition that causes them to debase people of color with impunity. It makes individuals seem oblivious to the regressive nature and sheer cruelty of their actions.\n\nYes, this is racism, but also something much more serious. It is what I would call \u201cpathobigotry,\u201d a mental condition born of one\u2019s own feelings of inadequacy that drives one to degrade and consciously discriminate against others who are different as a means of bolstering one\u2019s own sense of self-worth.\n\nI think it is time we start calling Donald Trump what he is.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/upshot/pennsylvania-congressional-map-ruling.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Big a Deal Is a New Congressional Map for Pennsylvania? Although Democrats will probably pick up a few additional seats in this year\u2019s election, the development is less helpful for them than it might at first appear.\n\nThe Republicans are counting on a favorable congressional map to help their majority ride out a possible \u201cwave\u201d election this November. But the congressional map got a little less favorable on Monday when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state\u2019s Republican-drawn congressional map.\n\nIf the ruling holds \u2014 and it is expected to, because it\u2019s based on state law, not federal \u2014 this will be the fourth Republican gerrymander to be eroded by the courts since the 2014 midterm elections. It will probably cost the Republicans at least one seat in this year\u2019s midterms, while eroding their position in several others.\n\nPennsylvania has one of the harshest gerrymanders in the country. Republicans have held a 13-to-5 majority in the state\u2019s congressional delegation since the map took effect in 2012, even though the state is traditionally competitive in state and federal elections.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict exactly what the new map will look like. The court ordered the Republican-controlled state legislature to produce a new map by Feb. 9. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, will have a veto, and if a new map isn\u2019t approved by Feb. 15, the court will probably redraw the map itself. Neither outcome will necessarily yield an incumbent-blind nonpartisan map, like the kind that would be drawn by a commission in California or Arizona.\n\nEven so, there are already some things that seem likely:\n\nPatrick Meehan is the likeliest Republican to lose his seat.\n\nMr. Meehan\u2019s district, the Seventh, is routinely listed as one of the most severely gerrymandered in the country. It is likely to turn into a strongly Democratic district anchored in Delaware County.\n\nAfter the recent revelation that Mr. Meehan used taxpayer money to pay a sexual harassment settlement, Republicans would seem to have less incentive to take steps to give him even an outside chance at re-election.\n\nMore Republican seats will become more Democratic, but perhaps not by all that much.\n\nThe open 15th District, vacated by the retiring Charlie Dent, could easily move to the left. Democrats already have a good chance to win the district, and they might even be considered favorites on a new map. But the Lehigh Valley will be a battleground district no matter how the map is drawn.\n\nEither the 16th or the Sixth District, which both stretch from Philadelphia\u2019s western suburbs to the countryside, would probably drift somewhat to the left but would remain competitive. Whichever district does not drift left might even move to the right, making it hard for the Democrats to gain another advantage.\n\nThe Eighth District could move slightly to the left if it takes in more of northeast Philadelphia, but the effect wouldn\u2019t be very large.\n\nOther districts might move to within striking distance for Democrats \u2014 like the open 11th District or Mike Kelly\u2019s Third District \u2014 but Republicans would still be considered favorites.\n\nA new map is less helpful to Democrats in this political environment.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say that the new map will lead Democrats to pick up two to four seats. But there\u2019s a catch: In this political environment, they were probably already going to win some of those seats anyway.\n\nJust take the district the Democrats were likeliest to pick up: the Seventh. Mr. Meehan was already in a competitive race. The district voted for Hillary Clinton, despite all the weird line drawing. And Mr. Meehan looks even more vulnerable after the news about sexual harassment settlement payouts.\n\nSo could a new map cost Republicans the Seventh District? Probably. But if Democrats already had a good shot, the change is less valuable than it would have been in 2016, when Mr. Meehan won easily in a more favorable political environment.\n\nOver all, six Republican-held seats in the state are currently rated as competitive by the Cook Political Report. We\u2019ll never know how many of those the Democrats would have gained on the current congressional map, but one could argue that the Republicans were already on track to lose two seats. If that\u2019s true, it won\u2019t be quite fair to attribute all Democratic gains to a new map.\n\nThe map might preserve at least some of the features that currently favor the Republicans, compared with a hypothetical partisan-blind map.\n\nThat\u2019s most likely if the Republican state legislature succeeds in drawing a map that Governor Wolf can accept. They\u2019ll probably take subtle steps to protect their incumbents.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine, for instance, that the Eighth District \u2014 held by the Republican Brian Fitzpatrick \u2014 won\u2019t add a chunk of northeast Philadelphia, as many potential nonpartisan maps have suggested.\n\nRepublican features might remain, even if the court redraws the map.\n\nDemocrats still probably won\u2019t get a map with nine Clinton districts and nine Trump districts.\n\nGerrymandering is a big problem for Democrats in Pennsylvania but not their only one. Geography creates a disadvantage, too. The main challenge for Democrats is that they waste a lot of votes in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where Mrs. Clinton won by a combined margin of 81 percent to 16 percent. Those lopsided tallies nearly let Mrs. Clinton win statewide, but don\u2019t yield any additional congressional districts over a more modest 65-to-35-point margin.\n\nTo my knowledge, the only plausible nine-nine map in the 2016 presidential election would involve splitting Pittsburgh into two districts \u2014 something that would run afoul of most nonpartisan redistricting criteria, including keeping municipalities intact and preserving communities of interest.\n\nA map with 10 Trump districts and 8 Clinton districts is easier to imagine, especially if the Democratic-led court redraws the map. Such a map would make the Democrats clear favorites to win the 15th District. But the most straightforward maps probably involve 11 districts that voted for Mr. Trump, even though he won by less than one point statewide.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

In the piece, Zingales compared Trump to Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister.\n\nThe Italian opposition, Zingales wrote, \u201cwas so rabidly obsessed with his personality that any substantive political debate disappeared; it focused only on personal attacks, the effect of which was to increase Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s popularity.

Sound familiar?\n\nDemocrats fare best when they fight Trump on policy grounds that can win over swing voters. That ground tends to be economic. Trump favors government cuts and corporate deregulation that would hurt many Americans. He has also failed to deliver on his promises to bring back factory jobs. \u201cIf you are a Democrat, and you are not talking about this every day,\u201d Ronald Klain, the longtime Democratic operative, wrote, referring to Trump\u2019s broken promises to Carrier workers in Indiana, \u201cyou are not using the most effective argument we have.\u201d\n\nA focus on economic issues will almost certainly be more effective than a focus on personality. But the question isn\u2019t just personality versus policy. It\u2019s also which kinds of policy Democrats emphasize. And economic issues are much more likely to be effective than cultural issues, even if Democrats rightly feel passionate about cultural issues like immigration and Trump\u2019s racism. Matthew Yglesias made this point well in Vox yesterday, also citing the recent Republican uptick in polls.\n\n\u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether Trump is racist (he is),\u201d Yglesias tweeted, summarizing his piece, \u201cit\u2019s whether harping on that is a good way to defeat racism.\u201d His answer \u2014 which I agree with \u2014 is no. \u201cIf you want to help the people most severely victimized by Trumpism, you need to beat Trumpism at the polls,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for the potential shutdown: Democrats are absolutely right to insist on protection for the so-called Dreamers \u2014 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. And I understand why Senate Democrats view a potential government shutdown as their best leverage.\n\nBut Democrats would also be wise to be honest with themselves about the political downsides here. Notably, Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 who represents a state Trump carried in 2016, the kind of area the party will need to win to retake control of Congress \u2014 seems concerned about a high-profile fight over immigration. It\u2019s not the subject most likely to drive Trump\u2019s approval rating back down into the 30s.\n\nThe best question for Democrats to ask themselves may be: Can we protect the Dreamers without turning immigration into the country\u2019s highest-profile political topic?\n\nTrump\u2019s agenda. Dr. Esther Choo laid out, in a series of tweets, who will suffer from the Trump administration\u2019s Medicaid changes: hard-working Americans doing their best to get by. This issue is one in which principled policy and smart politics are clearly aligned for Democrats.\n\nWhat about Wisconsin? In a special election this week in a Wisconsin state-legislature district, the Democrat won a shocking victory. The race is a reminder that Republicans remain very vulnerable.

Apple is among the companies handing out bonuses to workers in the wake of the $1.5 trillion tax cut. Credit Noah Berger/Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 There are good ways to start measuring how much the Trump tax cuts might be helping American workers. Tracking the bonus announcements flowing from corporations is not one of them.\n\nThose announcements, which include $2,500 in stock grants for Apple employees, up to $1,000 for certain workers at Walmart and $1,000 bonuses for Bank of America employees, are both real money and smart marketing. President Trump and top Republican lawmakers have praised many of the companies that are disclosing tax-cut-fueled bonuses and wage hikes.\n\nFor the most part, though, they are not indicative of the windfalls that companies are reaping from the $1.5 trillion tax law \u2014 and how much of that money that might trickle through to workers in the years to come.\n\nCompanies are acknowledging this in their fourth-quarter earnings reports and other financial disclosures, which earmark just a sliver of their future tax savings for direct and indirect investments in workers.\n\nBank of America\u2019s bonuses will cost the bank $145 million in 2018, or about 5 percent of the nearly $2.7 billion in savings it is expected to reap in 2018 from a lower, 21 percent corporate tax rate. Apple\u2019s bonuses will cost $300 million, a fraction of the $40 billion, at least, that the tech giant is saving from a single provision in the law, which allows it to return earnings held overseas at less than half the rate it would have paid under the old system.\n\nAnd two days before Walmart snagged glowing headlines for handing out $400 million in bonuses and lifting its minimum wage at a cost of $300 million, the nation\u2019s largest retailer by sales unveiled a plan to buy back company-issued debt. The cost of the buyback: $4 billion.\n\nThe gap between what companies are saving and how they are, so far, rewarding workers, doesn\u2019t mean that the new law won\u2019t eventually lead to substantial wage increases. Economists across the political spectrum agree it\u2019s simply too soon to tell whether \u2014 and to what degree \u2014 that will happen.\n\nThe flurry of high-profile bonus announcements \u201care hard to interpret,\u201d said Mihir Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School whose research supports the idea that corporate tax cuts lead to at least modest wage increases. \u201cThey may well be evidence for these gains, but just as well may be an example of savvy public relations. The reality is we\u2019ll have to wait for a few years and good empirical work to really know the answer.\u201d\n\nBefore Mr. Trump signed the tax bill in December, few companies had committed to rewarding workers if it passed. Since then, more than 200 have pledged bonuses, wage increases or other benefits for employees that are specifically tied to the new law, which includes deep cuts to business tax rates. The new law lowers the corporate rate to 21 percent, from a previous high of 35 percent, and it includes a 20 percent deduction for many owners of so-called pass-through companies, who pay taxes on their profits at individual income tax rates.\n\nRepublicans have celebrated the bonus announcements as part of a concerted party strategy to build public support for the new law. \u201cTax reform is working,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said on Thursday, before citing the Apple bonus announcement. \u201cWorkers are coming home and telling their families they got a bonus, or they got a raise, or they got better benefits.\u201d\n\nThe bonus announcements are, in some ways, a relatively easy opportunity to generate positive headlines and, perhaps, curry favor with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cCertainly, a lot of what you\u2019re seeing is bonuses, rather than wages. It\u2019s a one-time thing \u2014 you don\u2019t have to do it again. It\u2019s political, obviously. It\u2019s P.R.,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\nImage House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, at the Capitol last week. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nThere is some evidence that messaging is working: Since the bonus announcements began, polls have shown rising support for the law, though it is still the case that more voters oppose the tax bill than favor it.\n\nLiberals, though, have latched on to other details in recent corporate announcements \u2014 the ones that show companies plan to pass most of their initial tax savings to shareholders by raising dividends or buying back stock or debt.\n\nAn S&P Global report estimates that banks will return 75 percent of their windfall to shareholders. More than four in five Morgan Stanley analysts, across industries, said in a survey that the firms they track will use their tax gains to facilitate buybacks and dividends. Barely one in five said firms would pass even some of the tax gains on to workers.\n\nAndrew Bates, deputy communications director for the liberal opposition research group American Bridge, said the Walmart buybacks, which dwarf the cost of what it is returning to workers, show \u201cwhy Donald Trump is forced to hide most of the story when he tries selling this plan to the American people. It\u2019s also why they aren\u2019t buying it.\u201d\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading Democratic critic of Wall Street, said last week that tax-cut-linked share buybacks by companies such as Bank of America are \u201cnot a measure of the economic health of the American family.\u201d\n\nRepublicans predicted the majority of the corporate tax cut would eventually trickle down to workers through investment, jobs and wage increases. At one point early in the tax debate, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said that workers would enjoy the majority of the benefits from a corporate tax cut.\n\nThe theory is investment in structures, equipment and other initiatives, either by companies or their shareholders, boosts productivity in companies, and with it, wages. It is a bank-shot theory of wage growth, and one that many economists espouse, though often to a much lesser degree than Mr. Hassett, whose research suggested typical workers would see an increase of between $3,000 and $7,000 in take-home pay.\n\n\u201cThe theory that tax cuts will increase wages is a theory based on investment, and the effect that increased investment will have on productivity,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt is not a theory based on a pure transfer of excess profits into workers\u2019 profits. That takes longer than two weeks to happen.\u201d\n\nAnecdotes of bonus payments, or even minimum wage increases, are the least-useful way to determine if a tax change is lifting workers, said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation in Washington. The best way is rigorous academic study, which Mr. Greenberg noted takes years to complete.\n\nThe middle ground between those two is watching economic indicators \u2014 the rate of investment growth in the economy, or of real wage growth.\n\nBut even that will prove tricky in the months to come, because the economy was strengthening even before the tax cut. Most economists believe the United States is now at or near so-called full employment, when employers are forced to compete for scarce workers, and employees are empowered to bargain for higher wages, whether their companies just received a tax break or not.\n\nMr. O\u2019Sullivan said it will be difficult to initially tease out the impact of the tax bill from those overall trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to buried in with everything else,\u201d he said.\n\nPoliticians will make no such distinctions, of course. But workers might be able to guess if wage gains are in their future, at least a little bit, by reading the fine print of corporate announcements. If companies announce new projects, initiatives or capital investments \u2014 anything that might boost worker productivity \u2014 wage increases could follow.\n\nNot because companies are dying to share their tax spoils with workers. But because they have to, or those workers will take a job with another company that will.\n\nCorrection : An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the dollar amount of stock grants for Apple employees.

A form from the prison system\u2019s literature review committee obtained by The New York Times indicates that the book was rejected because it presented a security threat and was filled with what the document called \u201cracial overtures.\u201d\n\nIn North Carolina prisons, \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d has been banned multiple times, most recently on Feb. 24, 2017, when it was deemed \u201clikely to provoke confrontation between racial groups.\u201d State policy dictates that such bans can last for only a year, so the book will be permitted in the state\u2019s prisons late next month \u2014 unless it is banned again.\n\n\u201cAll you need is one prison to challenge it, and then the book goes back on the list,\u201d said Katya Roytburd, a volunteer with Prison Books Collective, a nonprofit that sends free books to prisoners in North Carolina and Alabama.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe central thesis of \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d is that the mass incarceration of black people is an extension of the American tradition of racial discrimination.\n\nIt zeroes in on how the \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric of the 1950s and 1960s led to the war on drugs and harsh law enforcement and sentencing policies, which disproportionately affect black people.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer socially permissible to use race, explicitly, as a justification for discrimination, exclusion, and social contempt,\u201d she writes in the introduction. \u201cSo we don\u2019t.

And while a bipartisan push for sentencing reform took place during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, those efforts have stalled under Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Trump.\n\nThe choices prisons make when banning books can seem arbitrary, even capricious. In Texas, 10,000 titles are banned, including such head-scratchers as \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and a compilation by the humor writer Dave Barry.\n\n\u201cMein Kampf,\u201d on the other hand, is permitted, along with several books by white nationalists, despite the existence of prison gangs like the murderous Aryan Brotherhood of Texas.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the banned book lists and specifically the stuff that\u2019s being allowed, there\u2019s a definite bias toward violent armed white supremacy and the censorship of anything that questions the existing religious or political status quo,\u201d said Paul Wright, the executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center.\n\nActivists see bans as an indictment of how prisoners are limited more broadly. Amy Peterson, a member of NYC Books Through Bars, which sends books to inmates in 40 states, said books were often sent back with little explanation.\n\n\u201cIt does seem very much up to the person in the shipping room who\u2019s making these arbitrary decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it as one of the many ways that people are deprived of basic rights in prison.\u201d\n\nBut for many incarcerated people, the ban on \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d does not seem arbitrary. In 2014, Dominic Passmore, a prisoner in Michigan, ordered the book after checking to make sure that it had not been banned in the state.

Roger Werholtz, who served as secretary of corrections in Kansas and as interim executive director of corrections in Colorado, said that books that could interfere with safety, like instructions on how to pick locks or make weapons, or those that could incite disturbances, such as racist or white supremacist literature, were banned under his watch.\n\nHe said that he did not think banning Ms. Alexander\u2019s book for its arguments about race made sense.\n\n\u201cI would be pretty skeptical of that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not anything that you don\u2019t see in the newspaper.

That price tag was too high to be included in the 2017 tax bill, which was limited in scope by Republicans\u2019 decision to pass the bill on party lines using a budget reconciliation bill that only allowed for $1.5 trillion in revenue losses over a decade.\n\nThe bill to end the shutdown, which funds government operations through Feb. 8 and also includes a six-year reauthorization of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, did not move through budget reconciliation, the parliamentary procedure that circumvents filibusters in the Senate. That allowed Republican leaders to include the delays in the health insurance taxes without worrying about their fiscal cost, a move that drew few objections from Democrats.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That bipartisan opposition, in part, reflects the broad footprint of the industry. Major device makers are headquartered in deep blue states like Massachusetts.\n\nThe so-called Cadillac tax, which taxes employers who offer very expensive health insurance plans, also enjoys some bipartisan opposition. The measure, much beloved by economists, is designed to encourage employers to lower health care costs by creating a stronger incentive to reduce spending on insurance. Economists tend to believe that the current system, which does not impose any income taxes on health benefits, encourages employers to overspend on health care, increases health care prices, and results in lower wages.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if, as economists, we\u2019ve just fallen down and not done a particularly good job explaining this to policymakers and the general public or whether this is just very hard,\u201d said Martin Gaynor, a health economist at Carnegie Mellon University, and one of 101 economists and health policy experts who signed a letter opposing postponement of the Cadillac tax. \u201cThe costs are obvious and immediate and benefits to this are indirect and diffuse and happen in the future, and that\u2019s just a very heavy lift for policy.\u201d\n\nBut imposing the tax on expensive benefits would affect many large companies, including many that employ unionized workers, and it is unpopular with voters. Some Republicans in Congress do endorse changes to the tax treatment of employer-sponsored health plans, but they have been reluctant to include such a plan in legislation.\n\nA third tax, known as the health insurance tax, is applied to all health plans and has been the source of an ongoing lobbying effort by the insurance industry, which argues that it increases the cost of health insurance for individuals and businesses. Actuaries and independent analysts agree that the tax does tend to increase insurance prices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tax would still apply to this year\u2019s plans, one of several factors that have led to steep price hikes in the Obamacare health insurance marketplaces.

Roughly 4,500 children have benefited from Demos\u2019s free three-year program since it began, and half enrolled in additional music classes after completing the program, according to its co-founder and current leader, Gilles Delebarre.\n\n\u201cWhen children get used to a cultural habit at a young age, they keep it,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics of such programs argue that while initiatives that reach a few thousand people yield positive if limited results, more should be invested in music education in schools or \u201cconservatoires,\u201d or public music academies.\n\nPhoto\n\nSt\u00e9phane Dorin, a sociology professor at the University of Limoges in France who studies evolving tastes in music, said that projects such as Demos or Jaroussky\u2019s academy were too expensive to roll out more widely. This year, the Demos project has a budget of 7.8 million euros, or $9.5 million, for 3,000 children, according to Mr. Delebarre.\n\nSuch programs \u201cwon\u2019t transform in depth the relationship that kids from working classes have with classical music,\u201d Mr. Dorin said. But he praised the recent announcement by the ministers of education and culture that all of France\u2019s primary and middle schools would have choirs in the next two years. If fully implemented, the \u20ac20 million plan could reach more than 10 million children every year.\n\nIt was at school that Mr. Jaroussky fell in love with music. He grew up in the Paris suburb of Sartrouville, in a middle-class family \u2014 \u201cneither rich nor poor, with no musicians at home\u201d \u2014 he says, but his music teacher encouraged his parents to enroll him at the local conservatoire.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom age 10 to 22, he played the violin, and he started playing the piano when he was 15. He began singing at 18, and made his professional singing debut at 21.\n\nNow 39 and with a global career, Mr. Jaroussky describes wanting to use his fame to encourage private sponsors to support his academy, a practice that is much less common in France than in countries like the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThree-quarters of the academy\u2019s annual budget of \u20ac500,000 comes from private institutions and donors. Mr. Jaroussky wants to train 100 young musicians over the next three years, and to set up satellite academies in the cities of Lille and Marseille.\n\nThe academy also offers free master classes for professional musicians and singers ages 18 to 25, some taught by Mr. Jaroussky himself, as well as free concerts for the children it trains and their parents. In France, 12 percent of those who attend classical concerts do so under the influence of their children, according to the 2015 study by the French Association of Orchestras, and the academy has sought to encourage parents to follow their children\u2019s progress.\n\nBack at the academy, the auditorium was filling up.

And in Tennessee, a lawmaker withdrew his proposal to give state backing to school officials who impose restrictive bathroom policies, only eight days after he introduced it.\n\n\u201cI think people are tempering, and I think they\u2019re thinking harder about what can be achieved, what needs to be achieved,\u201d said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor at the University of Illinois who has written extensively about the intersection of gay rights and religious freedom. \u201cThere\u2019s been a slow IV drip of common sense to legislators, and you have lots and lots of people speaking to them and saying, \u2018It\u2019s not viable to do an extreme thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor generations, and especially in the 31 months since the United States Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, the legislatures of the South have been a cultural battleground.\n\nMississippi passed, and has so far successfully defended in court, a law allowing people to use their religious beliefs to justify refusing to provide services to gay people. North Carolina was the setting for the legal and cultural clash over restrooms and discrimination protections that drew national attention. Last year, Alabama passed a law allowing faith-based adoption groups to refuse to work with same-sex couples and still keep their state licenses. And a candidate there who had publicly condemned gay people and tried to block same-sex marriages in the state nearly won election to the United States Senate.\n\nOn the other hand, Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia vetoed a bill that lawmakers passed in 2016 to shield religious groups from repercussions if they refused to employ or serve gay people. In Tennessee, two bills that reaffirm the state Constitution\u2019s view that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that criticize the Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage as \u201ca lawless opinion with no basis in American law or history,\u201d have sputtered.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd in Texas, where some of the country\u2019s most contentious bills on gay and transgender rights have been brought up, the Legislature is not scheduled to meet at all in 2018. A \u201cbathroom bill\u201d failed twice there last year.\n\nObservers on all sides say it is too early to know with certainty whether more contentious social legislation will eventually emerge this year. But the evidence so far suggests that the pace has slowed markedly.\n\nLawmakers, advocates and experts offer several explanations for this year\u2019s apparent falloff. Washington figures prominently in some of them: Legislators are waiting to see what the Supreme Court decides in a major case involving a baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, some say. And many conservatives are said to be focused on pushing ahead at the federal rather than state level while Republicans control Congress and the White House.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are also worries that lawmakers have been distracted for too long from practical issues like education and infrastructure. And some point to a creeping sense of rancor fatigue.\n\n\u201cAfter you have a bill come up two or three years in a row, or an issue, you sort of lose the fervor,\u201d said Steven Dickerson, a Republican state senator in Tennessee.\n\nSteven W. Long, a South Carolina Republican who sponsored the restroom bill that is mired in the Legislature there, said that he and people who share his views know they may not see swift action.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We\u2019re not going to see the results that we want to see overnight. It\u2019s taken us years to get where are, and it\u2019s going to take years to get us where we want to be.\u201d\n\nOne factor that seems to loom large is that, though the bills have often been popular with conservative voters, they go down very poorly with another important constituency: big business. Officials in states hoping to attract major investments from out-of-state corporations \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s second headquarters \u2014 say they drew a lesson from the boycotts and cancellations that North Carolina suffered over its bathroom bill.\n\nIn Georgia, the House speaker told a radio station that any legislation that \u201ccreates headwinds\u201d for economic development was unappealing. The governor\u2019s chief of staff, addressing an event sponsored by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said he urged Republican candidates \u201cto remember when they speak, those headlines go as quick and far as the C.E.O.\u2019s desk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(Those pleas may not be heeded as the campaign for governor heats up: All the major Republican contenders have vowed to support a \u201creligious freedom\u201d proposal like the one Mr. Deal blocked, under significant corporate pressure, and some lawmakers have promised to stir debate in the Legislature this year, however limited it may ultimately be.)\n\nThe economic argument has particular resonance and urgency in the South, where a handful of cities are seen as leading finalists for the Amazon project, which the company has said will lead to 50,000 new jobs. Amazon did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nIn a recent speech near Georgia\u2019s gold-topped Capitol, Mr. Deal seemed to signal that the state ought to set aside legislative proposals that might spook the Seattle-based company or try to read its mind: \u201cWe cannot waste valuable time, energy and effort, when what we should be doing is focusing on enhancing those issues which have already made us an attractive candidate to Amazon.\u201d\n\nSupporters of bills to permit faith-based exemptions from discrimination laws protecting gay people dismiss Mr. Deal\u2019s arguments as convenient cover for a lame-duck governor. In Georgia and beyond, religious conservatives contend that they have not ceded any ground.\n\n\u201cWithin our organizations and groups and constituencies, I think there\u2019s still the same energy,\u201d said Mathew D. Staver, the chairman of Liberty Counsel, which has litigated against same-sex marriage. \u201cThe battle is not just in the courts and in the legislatures; it\u2019s also in the corporate world.\u201d\n\nMr. Staver\u2019s opponents make no apologies for the evolution of their strategy, which now relies heavily on the public pressure that large companies and corporate executives can bring to bear.\n\n\u201cI think Amazon is very much part of this conversation that\u2019s happening with big business in the U.S.,\u201d said Ms. Oakley of the Human Rights Campaign. Companies, she added, are \u201csaying these bills are harmful to our ability to do business, to our employees, to the quality of life that we want our employees to be enjoying. With that voice, I think state legislatures have slowed down the momentum.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the turmoil created by these legislative efforts could resurface at any moment and throw a state legislature into sudden chaos.\n\n\u201cThings kind of ebb and flow sometimes, and most things can catch you by surprise,\u201d Mr. Snowden, the Mississippi lawmaker, observed recently. \u201cBut right now, it seems to be a period of relative calm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen he chuckled and added, \u201cThat\u2019s today.\u201d", "keywords": ["gay", "weary", "samesex", "wary", "lawmakers", "religious", "state", "wars", "rights", "bill", "tone", "southern", "south", "bills", "culture", "mr", "think"], "sentiment": 0.139352579681527},

He\u2019s a dramatist and a linguist who can be glorious about the ordinariness and misery of duty and work. His plays \u2014 like \u201cThe Beauty Queen of Leenane\u201d or \u201cThe Cripple of Inishmaan\u201d \u2014 tether behavior to state of mind. You believe what people do because they appear to be making the choices \u2014 ugly ones \u2014 as opposed to an author you can picture yanking the strings.\n\nBut his movies are all strings. Often they feel as if other filmmakers are doing the pulling. \u201cIn Bruges\u201d featured two hit men on a chatty stroll in Belgium, and certain people\u2019s passion for it is fit for Valentine\u2019s Day. But it was Tupperware Tarantino to me.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo \u201cThree Billboards\u201d admirers and to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the outfit that hands out the Golden Globes, something about the movie rings true or feels timely. That presumption of truth is driving some of the annoyance over this movie. My favorite bad thing about \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is its ambition to play around with America\u2019s ideological and geographical toys.\n\nOne of the toys is the word \u201cnigger.\u201d Another is the concept of political correctness. There\u2019s a scene between Mildred and a hotheaded dimwit cop \u2014 the racist \u2014 named Jason (Sam Rockwell), in which she baits his racism by calling him a \u201cnigger torturer.\u201d He hits the roof. \u201cPerson-of-color-torturing\u201d is what Jason says you must call it now, with exasperated lament. They volley the word and poke fun at its impropriety. You can tell that Mr. McDonagh relished the application of absurdism to the political correction (he knows \u201cperson-of-color-torturing\u201d really is linguistic torture, maybe even for a person of color). But he also seems to like the loaded nonsense in the sound of the word \u201cnigger.\u201d What you hear in a scene like this is a kind of careless virtuosity. It\u2019s a fun scene that\u2019s sunk by how much fun it\u2019s having with things you\u2019re not supposed to have fun with. The whole movie is like that \u2014 it\u2019s like Mildred \u2014 rude for sport and proud of it.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a place for a white artist to poke, laughingly, at our racial and class messes. (Mel Brooks, for instance, excelled at it.) But Mr. McDonagh doesn\u2019t want to do more than poke. The Danish director Lars von Trier tried a more explicit damnation of the United States with \u201cDogville\u201d (2003) and \u201cManderlay\u201d (2005). But I liked the nihilism in Mr. von Trier\u2019s respective approximations of racism and slavery, even if he followed a European habit, especially in documentaries, of diagnosing America\u2019s ills in the least surprising and most patronizing way.\n\nFor a movie that asks you to behold so much violence \u2014 defenestration and talk of rape, a bludgeoning, a suicide, charred skin, a dental drill that treats a thumb like drywall \u2014 \u201cThree Billboards\u201d feels weirdly benign. Its black comedy doesn\u2019t leave a bruise. The violence curdles into the cartoonish. The movie could be about grace and vengeance, but they\u2019re presented as hoary lessons and hokey contrivances \u2014 happening upon a deer, sharing your orange juice with the madman who tried to murder you, juxtaposing the reading of an inspirational letter with an inferno. There\u2019s no reckoning with anything, no introspection, just escalating mayhem. The mix of the silly and the serious puts the movie in Coen brothers territory. But they can adjust the settings for their cynicism. Even at their worst, they\u2019ve got their finesse. Mr. McDonagh just keeps bashing away.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis really is an action movie whose action is played for laughs. Mildred beats up teenagers and tells off priests. Her precision with a Molotov cocktail should land her in the Super Bowl. Ms. McDormand certainly makes the most of the tirade machine Mr. McDonagh has built for her. (Not since \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d has anybody gotten to tell off this many people with this much gusto.) You feel for Mildred, but you fear her more. When she approaches a table in a restaurant carrying a wine bottle, the audience practically begs her not to use it. By this point, Mildred is way past being a mad mommy. She\u2019s Charles Bronson.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut she\u2019s not the only bereft mother fueled by vengeance. The foreign language Golden Globe went, in a surprise, to Fatih Akin\u2019s \u201cIn the Fade,\u201d which has Diane Kruger as a white German who must endure the legal trial of the neo-Nazi terrorists who killed her Turkish-German husband and their young son. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t rank up there with \u201cHead-On\u201d (2004) and \u201cThe Edge of Heaven\u201d (2007), Mr. Akin\u2019s masterwork melodramas. It\u2019s too well oiled a machine, too morally simple to be completely satisfying. But it\u2019s more clear-eyed and serious than \u201cThree Billboards\u201d about what it means to inflict pain. Maybe there\u2019s a way to laugh through rage, but Mr. Akin doesn\u2019t know what way that would be. Neither, I would argue, does Mr. McDonagh.\n\n\u201cThree Billboards\u201d is a cupcake rolled in glass. It all just feels off. The redemption of the racist cop doesn\u2019t bother me \u2014 Sam Rockwell studiously plays him as a dangerous dope. But the way two other black characters (Amanda Warren and Darrell Britt-Gibson) and a smitten dwarf (Peter Dinklage) bop around Mildred is almost Muppet-like. (Mr. Dinklage\u2019s stature is meant to be a source of unapologetic amusement. More stuff you\u2019re not supposed to have fun with!)\n\nEventually, the film introduces a temporary black police chief (Clarke Peters) who seems meant to draw out \u2014 Sidney Poitier-style \u2014 some of the bigotry coursing through town, or at least through the precinct. But he\u2019s as much a prop as one of the billboards.\n\nI thought a lot about this movie watching \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d an eight-part, sitcom-length show created by Dan Perrault and Tony Yacenda, on Netflix. It parodies the true-crime boomlet epitomized by \u201cThe Jinx\u201d on HBO, \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d on Netflix and podcasts like \u201cSerial.\u201d And, like \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d the series revolves around jerks. Someone spray-painted 27 penises on 27 cars in the staff parking lot of a high school in Oceanside, Calif. And two student reporters investigate. The prime suspect \u2014 a stoner-skate punk senior named Dylan Maxwell \u2014 has been expelled. The two reporters poke holes in the case against him and explore a gamut of alternative culprits.\n\nLike Mr. McDonagh\u2019s movie, \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d takes a circuitous route to earnestly asked philosophical questions about human nature. The show has a breezy confidence that never tips all the way into mockery. But it\u2019s a lot less impressed with itself. It undermines the piety and ethical lapses in nonfiction mystery shows, while sharing with \u201cThree Billboards\u201d a belief in semaphores and that people aren\u2019t any one thing. Also \u2014 and this feels important \u2014 it feels like the people who made this show understand their setting and the people who live there. I\u2019ve never been to Oceanside, but I believe this show\u2019s rendition of it.\n\nEven in a setting as generic as an American high school, the show has a sense of place. And it\u2019s a white show whose nonwhite characters don\u2019t feel like objects. I\u2019m not sure what Ebbing is. You can feel that uncertainty in the movie\u2019s cop-out of a finale, in its bewildering loftiness (\u201cOscar Wilde\u201d as a character\u2019s last words) and in the coveralls Mildred spends most of the movie wearing. Her job is at a rustic gift shop, but the coveralls point to the harder blue-collar work we\u2019ve seen Ms. McDormand do in movies like \u201cNorth Country.\u201d Here, these clothes signify emotional work, yet they feel like a put-on, too. Three billboards, sure \u2014 but outside a coffee shop in Portland, Ore.\n\nThe movie isn\u2019t an explicit work of politics, but it reaches something political in certain people in the same way it touches something emotional in others. And yet in arguing about this movie what I don\u2019t want, but where I\u2019m afraid we are \u2014 with lots of film this time every year \u2014 is in another fight over a movie\u2019s politics that manages to leave the movie itself behind.\n\nWhose fault is that? We\u2019ve been seduced and bullied into thinking of the awards season as a process of politics. The people who make the movies also run or finance \u201ccampaigns.\u201d There is opposition research, and, in the form of other award shows, primaries, so to speak. And it all culminates with the election night we call the Academy Awards broadcast. So it\u2019s only natural that we tend to think of best picture (and a few of the major, ancillary categories) as a kind of vote in which, while average people have no say, we\u2019re all invested in the symbolism and catharsis of the outcome.\n\n\u201cThree Billboards,\u201d which is not based on a true story but does have some reality flavoring, must appear worthy of elected office, in some way.

An upswing in the support of white, working-class voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin helped deliver Mr. Trump the White House, despite his popular vote loss.\n\nThose voters will be critical both to Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign in 2020 and to Republican fortunes in the midterm elections in November. If, as Mr. Trumka suggested, support is eroding, then the president\u2019s hold on the Rust Belt would be shaky.\n\nMr. Trumka said the president had been generous with access to the Oval Office and administration officials, and he described Mr. Trump as \u201ccharming person to person.\u201d One meeting scheduled to last 30 minutes went on for nearly three hours, he said.\n\nBut those meetings, and the president\u2019s affability, failed to yield results, Mr. Trumka said: \u201cAccess isn\u2019t the problem. Impact is the question. Is the access having any impact? So far I would say we haven\u2019t done real well.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have a president who is on all sides and no side.\u201d\n\nOn specific issues, Mr. Trumka criticized Mr. Trump for failing to \u201clabel China as a currency manipulator\u201d and said the president had rejected plans to \u201crevitalize our coal communities.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Labor unions will also target another dozen states.\n\nHistorically, labor has aligned strongly with the Democratic Party, but Mr. Trump\u2019s election showed that many in the rank and file were open to a Republican candidate. Mr. Trumka said union members were willing to vote for Mr. Trump because they felt establishment candidates in both parties had failed them, and they were ready to give the first-time politician \u201ca chance.\u201d\n\nNow, he said, workers are far less enthusiastic. The tax cut plan, Mr. Trumka said, favored companies over workers, adding that it \u201crewards outsourcing\u201d of jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing hasn\u2019t matched up with what he\u2019s said,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.\n\nIn the last election, Mr. Trump outperformed Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, by four percentage points among union members. But, Mr. Trumka noted, Hillary Clinton underperformed President Barack Obama by about 10 percentage points among union members.\n\nInstead of delivering change, Mr. Trump is \u201cdoubling down on everything that got us to this point,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, referring to the president\u2019s tax and economic policies.\n\nBut Mr. Trumka also cautioned Democrats to outline an agenda that would appeal to union workers or risk losing their votes again in the midterm elections.\n\nMr. Trumka had initially joined the president\u2019s business council, but resigned in August after the president\u2019s seemingly ambivalent remarks about racists protesting in Charlottesville, Va.", "keywords": ["midterm", "president", "republican", "workers", "hurt", "actively", "union", "trump", "presidents", "chief", "trumka", "having", "mr", "losing", "support"], "sentiment": 0.12045601790499749},

As The Times\u2019s Glenn Thrush reported in October, Kelly seems to be \u201cmoving from the role of quiet backstage manager to open partisan.\u201d\n\nHis hostility toward immigration has been evident from the beginning of his time in the administration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Kelly managed to translate much of Trump\u2019s brazen anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric into actual policy. And if the numbers are any indication, Kelly has certainly flourished. Arrests since Trump took office in February increased by 40 percent over the prior year. But perhaps more important than the numbers is Kelly\u2019s impact on immigrant communities, where apprehension and fear now reign.\u201d\n\nWhile at the D.H.S., Kelly even considered separating immigrant parents from their accompanying children if they enter the country illegally. As The Times reported:\n\n\u201cStill, the prospect of breaking a sacred bond between parent and child has not been an easy decision. Mr. Kelly said early this year that he was considering the move, but after an uproar from immigrant advocates and some members of Congress, he said that families would be separated only in extreme circumstances, such as when the child was in danger because of the parent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of Kelly\u2019s primary targets has been the Temporary Protected Status program.\n\nAs The Times has reported: \u201cThe protection for Haitians was most recently extended in May, by John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary at the time. He allowed only a six-month extension, a shorter one than is typical, saying that the Haitians \u2018need to start thinking about returning.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Times also reported that in November, Kelly \u201cunsuccessfully tried to pressure the Homeland Security Department to end a program that allows hundreds of thousands of people from countries affected by natural disasters or violence to live in the United States without fear of being deported, according to people familiar with the discussions.\u201d\n\nMany of those countries have populations that are either black or brown. Those were the countries Trump vulgarly disparaged. So why are Trump and Kelly so dogged in their opposition to these particular programs?\n\nI, along with many others, have pointed out Trump\u2019s obvious racism, but Kelly\u2019s relationship to race is also troubling.\n\nIn October, Kelly said that \u201cRobert E. Lee was an honorable man\u201d and that \u201cthe lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,\u201d displaying a staggering ignorance about the conflict and a racial insensitivity that marginalized the centrality of slavery to the war.\n\nFurthermore, while at D.H.S., Kelly appointed the Rev. Jamie Johnson to lead the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. It was later disclosed that in 2008 Johnson had said on a radio show that black people were anti-Semitic because they were envious of Jewish people. Johnson also said America\u2019s black community \u201chad turned America\u2019s major cities into slums because of laziness, drug use and sexual promiscuity.\u201d\n\nI am no fan of John Kelly.

Rather than a blanket restriction, his executive order specified that White House officials could not lobby the agencies they served, and did not cover congressional officials.\n\nBut he has not taken any action on two other promises. Mr. Trump has yet to propose term limits for members of Congress or enact a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\n\nForgoing a salary\n\nMr. Trump, a billionaire, vowed to not take \u201ceven one dollar\u201d of his $400,000 annual salary as president, following in the footsteps of presidents like John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover.\n\nSo far, he has kept his word, donating his paychecks to the National Park Service in the first quarter of 2017, the Education Department in the second, and then the Health and Human Services Department in the third to help combat the opioid crisis.

Though tax lawyers may advise against it, the I.R.S. has said that an audit does not prevent individuals from releasing their own tax information. The Trump campaign also released a letter from his lawyers that said Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, before 2009, were \u201cclosed administratively\u201d \u2014 or no longer subject to an audit.\n\nBut in May, Mr. Trump reneged on the promise in an interview with The Economist, moving the release date to \u201cafter I\u2019m out of office.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPlaying golf only in the interest of the country\n\nAfter incessantly chastising President Barack Obama for golfing, Mr. Trump promised during the campaign that \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to be working for you, I\u2019m not going to have time to go play golf.\u201d He later made an exception for \u201cleaders of countries and people who can help us.\u201d\n\nYet Mr. Trump has played more golf than his predecessor, according to independent trackers.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s golf partners. While he played a round with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in February, he was also accompanied by professional golf players, not world leaders, for at least four games.\n\nTaking no vacations\n\nMr. Trump pledged to \u201cnot be a president who took vacations\u201d and blasted Mr. Obama for his own personal trips.\n\nIn a 2012 report, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the president is \u201calways on duty\u201d and that his vacations are considered official travel.\n\nOver the past year, Mr. Trump has taken some R&R. He spent 17 days in at his golf club in New Jersey, which the White House labeled a \u201cworking vacation,\u201d and voyaged to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a holiday respite that included presidential duties.\n\nIt is unclear how those trips were different from the vacations that Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama for taking. The former president, for example, spent holidays in Hawaii \u2014 a frequent talking point of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 where he played golf, received intelligence briefings and visited troops.\n\nOver all, Mr. Trump has visited a Trump property one out of every three days since taking office.", "keywords": ["president", "white", "trumps", "tax", "pledges", "vacations", "service", "presidency", "trump", "house", "golf", "look", "mr", "later"], "sentiment": 0.02265800865800866}
